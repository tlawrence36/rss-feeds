      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even pinpoint a single emotion because I feel that it changes like every five minutes,\u201d she told The Associated Press, still buzzing a day after her debut. \u201cI woke up and I still sort of felt in the world of Oz.\u201d",
      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",

It just feels like I\u2019m taking the entire audience in my arms.\u201d",

      "Others who have played the role over the years include Shoshana Bean, Stephanie J. Block, Jessica Vosk, Eden Espinosa, Ana Gasteyer and, of course, Idina Menzel, who won a Tony Award in the role in 2004.",

      "The Glastonbury Festival in southwest England is clearly aiming to go out with a bang this summer before it takes a year off to allow the farmland to recover",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Glastonbury Festival is clearly aiming to go out with a bang this summer before taking one of its regular fallow years off to allow the southwest England farmland where the music fest takes place to recover after hosting some 200,000 revelers.",
      "Festival organizers announced the lineup on Thursday, including the headline acts, for arguably the world\u2019s most famous music festival. This year, it will take place at Worthy Farm from June 25 to June 29.",
      "The main news is that English band The 1975 will headline the main Pyramid Stage on the festival's Friday night, while American singer and actress Olivia Rodrigo will take top billing on the Sunday evening.",
      "Neil Young, the legendary 79-year-old Canadian-American singer-songwriter, was previously announced as the headliner for the Saturday night, while his Scottish peer Rod Stewart had been confirmed for the coveted legends slot on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Not making the top of the bill, but very much in vogue and likely to draw huge crowds, is Charli XCX, who will perform on the Other Stage on the Saturday night. Last week, the singer behind the \u201cBrat summer\" phenomenon, won five Brit awards.",
      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",
      "Closing out the Other Stage on the festival's Sunday night will be English electronic group The Prodigy, most famous for the pumping 1996 track \u201cFirestarter.\" The performance will be particularly poignant as it will mark the band's first at the festival since the death of frontman Keith Flint in 2019.",
      "Other acts include Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut, and the recently reformed U.S. pop group Scissor Sisters.",
      "There are no scheduled performers on the festivals first two days, Wednesday and Thursday, though many ad hoc events take place as attendees arrive and pitch up their tents.",
      "A lot of interest will focus on Manchester-formed The 1975, which is fronted by Matty Healy. The band has headlined various festivals in the United Kingdom \u2014 but not Glastonbury \u2014 and elsewhere, with controversial stage antics.",
      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",
      "While the price may be fixed, the mid-summer weather isn't. As always, the hopes of everyone going are the same: Please, no mudbath!"

      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music",
      "NEW YORK -- She was the first to go \u201cSOLO.\u201d",
      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music. On Friday, she becomes the latest to drop a debut solo studio album, the English-language \u201cRuby.\u201d It's a kaleidoscope of different sounds for Jennie, full of incongruous, polished pleasures.",
      "\u201cSOLO,\u201d her debut single, was a product of its time \u2013 nostalgic EDM-pop with pitched up whistle effects and simple, declarative lyrics. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo,\" she repeated on the chorus. You had to believe her: She wasn\u2019t leaving her band, but a lackluster relationship, an ex so innocuous they're barely a player in the song. \u201cThis time I\u2019m only lookin\u2019 at me, myself and I,\u201d she sang, \u201cI\u2019ma do it on my own now.\u201d A lot has changed in the time since, but the core of her and her band's sonic messaging \u2014 self-empowerment above all else \u2014 hasn't wavered.",
      "On \u201cRuby,\u201d it's strongest on the singles \u201cMantra,\" where Jennie cheerleads in a chant-along chorus: \u201cPretty girls don\u2019t do drama \u2019less we wanna / it\u2019ll be depending on the day\" atop brassy production perfect for primetime commercial placement. Or \u201cExtraL\u201d with the innovative Doechii, whose acicular raps give additional weight to \u201cYeah, we lappin\u2019 the men,\u201d a line delivered with laughter.",
      "But it isn't all assertions of autonomy. On the languid \u201cLove Hangover\u201d with Dominic Fike, she's falling into destructive patterns with an undeserving partner; in a falsetto, her chameleonic vocal performance is so convincing, the recording almost doesn't even sound like Jennie. Or maybe it just doesn't sound like the Jennie fans have grown to known?",
      "Across \u201cRuby,\u201d don\u2019t expect cuts that would make a Blackpink record. Prior to \u201cRuby,\u201d Jennie had only worked with one producer \u2014 Teddy Park, a man synonymous with her girl group hits. This time around, she worked with an eclectic team ranging from Diplo to El Guincho \u2014 new voices to explore different facets of her personality. It's ambitious and glossy, moving from an acoustic ballad here (\u201cTwin\u201d), virtuosic rapping there (\u201cZen\u201d), to familiar beats on (\"With the IE (Way Up)\" and \u201cStart A War\u201d). And it pays off.",
      "Jennie tries her best Rihanna phrasing on the SZA-channeling \u201cStart A War,\" and maybe spends too much time with robust collaborations \u2014 Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis on the nostalgic R&B of \u201cDamn Right,\u201d Dua Lipa on \u201cHandlebars\" that launches straight into the chorus \u2014 perfect for TikTok.",
      "In whole, Jennie's \u201cRuby\u201d is a solid re-introduction to the Blackpink superstar. The songs are strong and diverse and nostalgic \u2014 but maybe not wholly distinctive. It is still a reason to be excited for her future solo work."

      "Research by the charity English Heritage suggests it may have found a portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen Lady Jane Grey",
      "LONDON -- A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.",
      "It said there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.",
      "One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII\u2019s reign.",
      "She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche\u2019s painting, \u201cThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey,\u201d which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.",
      "But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.",
      "Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a \u201clive\u201d painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama \"Bridgerton.\"",
      "The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: \"Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?\"",
      "Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 \u2014 Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.",
      "It also noted a \u201cstriking change\" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.",
      "Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage\u2019s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that \u201cwe are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.\u201d",
      "Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.",
      "Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.",
      "On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.",
      "On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death."

    "story": [
      "Lady Gaga rediscovered her passion for music through self-discovery, channeling her personal transformation into her new album \u201cMayhem.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When Lady Gaga walked into a New York City bar she frequented five years ago, the memories hit hard: Back then, she wrote songs there, feeling lost and disconnected from herself.",
      "But this time was different. While sitting in the bar, Gaga felt a sense of peace and rejuvenation, reminiscent of her teenage years spent scribbling lyrics on napkins.",
      "In recent years, Gaga rediscovered her passion for music by taking a step back from the limelight, cutting ties from fake friendships, swapping the spotlight for quiet nights at home and surrounding herself with people she truly trusts. That personal transformation became the soul of her new album, \u201cMayhem,\u201d which is being released Friday.",
      "\u201cI reclaimed myself as an artist,\u201d said Gaga, a 14-time Grammy and one-time Oscar winner who returned to her dark pop music roots on the album, which spans 14 tracks. Her new project follows last year\u2019s \u201c Harlequin,\u201d a jazz-inspired companion album for the film \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d which stalled at No. 20 on the Billboard 200.",
      "But Gaga's singles for the 14-track \u201cMayhem\u201d have been received well on the charts, including \u201c Disease,\u201d \u201c Abracadabra \u201d and \u201c Die With a Smile,\u201d a collaboration with Bruno Mars, spending five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1 and winning a Grammy for best pop duo/group performance earlier this month.",
      "While recording \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga refused to rest on her past hits or accolades to define her new work. She credited her renewed creative drive to a journey of self-discovery, which ultimately empowered her to step back into the spotlight for several big moments last month. The superstar performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys \u2014 including a tribute song \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\u201d to Los Angeles wildfire victims, closed out the FireAid benefit concert with \u201cAll I Need is Time\u201d and delivered a surprise performance singing \u201cHold My Hand\u201d before the Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "Next month, Gaga will headline Coachella and perform a free concert on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Copacabana Beach in May.",
      "\u201cI built a routine in my daily life around music all the time, and not around self-promotion,\u201d said Gaga, 38, who was a producer and co-executive producer with her fianc\u00e9 Michael Polansky, 41, on \u201cMayhem.\u201d \u201cWhen my life was circulating self-promotion, I think I lost a lot of my passion. When my life was around my family, my partner and my music, it gave me back that realness.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Gaga digs deeper into what it took to regain her passion, showing she's more than just a character and her pulling double duty on \u201cSaturday Night Live\" on Saturday.",
      "While Gaga was dropping early hits like \u201cJust Dance\u201d and \u201cPoker Face,\u201d she noticed critics who downplayed her role in the success, giving more credit to producers and even stylists.",
      "With \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga aimed to showcase that her talent was the true driving force behind her rise. Fueled by the skeptics, the singer is determined to show she's the architect of her success, not just another industry creation.",
      "\u201cThey tried to qualify and quantify me,\u201d she said. \u201cVery often as a woman in music, they say it was other people. You\u2019re a product, like you were made. Something that was really important to me on this was really taking from myself my own inventions.\u201d",
      "When Gaga began recording her new album, she focused on crafting the kind of dark pop melodies that defined her early career, pairing them with lyrics that spoke in code. She said it all came back naturally, giving her reassurance that she was on the right path to fully owning her identity as an artist instead of a made-up character",
      "\u201cThis was a way for me actually to feel like I wasn\u2019t. That it was the real me,\u201d she said. \"I was the creator. This was my work. It was just not a character I was playing. It was something that I made.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, fame came with a price that Gaga wasn't willing to pay. She felt isolated, trapped in transactional relationships and struck in an environment that prioritized competition over creativity.",
      "The spotlight began to feel like an endless race, draining her passion for making music. She began to notice a shift as her sales climbed beyond the first 10 million records.",
      "Gaga realized that staying in that energy would ultimately stifle her creativity, knowing it was time to break free.",
      "\u201cI lost the thing that I would teach my child, which is to sit alone with your thoughts and write a poem,\" Gaga said. \"Sit alone and write a song. Just put good old-fashioned hard work and craftsmanship into what you believe in. I lost that for a long time.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Gaga hit reset. She cut loose draining relationships and building a stable family with Michael Polansky and their beloved dogs.",
      "It helped Gaga channel her energy back into her artistry.",
      "\u201cThis is the first day I\u2019ve done interviews without makeup on, and it\u2019s nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI just get to share with you about my experience with music, and I\u2019m not feeling pressure to perform for you in any other way than as a female artist.\u201d",
      "In her appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Gaga will showcase her range as both the musical guest and host. But her versatility might shine even brighter in the show\u2019s sketch comedy skits.",
      "\u201cI get to work in all different kinds of art that I love so much,\u201d said Gaga, who will make her second appearance as \u201cSNL\u201d host and fifth as its musical guest. The first time she appeared as host and musical guest was in 2013.",
      "Gaga performed during the \u201c SNL50: The Homecoming Concert \u201d last month.",
      "\u201cDoing \u2018SNL\u2019 is all about hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor of love for the audience on Saturday night because we just want everybody to feel happy at home.\u201d",
      "To prepare, Gaga is synching up with the cast and building rapport, which she says will help balance her roles throughout the night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just be like really close with the cast,\u201d she said. \u201cThey write like all the sketches and they work like all week long on planning, so I feel like the better my relationship is with them and just like getting in there and being one of them, the better the show will be.\u201d",
      "Gaga added: \u201cI\u2019m treating my musical performances separately. I have to wear like a few different hats. There\u2019s hosting and then there\u2019s being the actor in the sketch, and being the artist that I am in my music. I\u2019m ready to do it though.\u201d"

      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",

      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "Celebrities bared a lot more than their emotions on Oscar night. The naked fashion trend was on full display at places like the Vanity Fair party carpet, where guests clearly bought into the idea that less is more.",
      "Among them: actor-director Olivia Wilde, who wore a sheer, embroidered lace negligee by Chlo\u00e9, \u201cwith metal ends and embroidered lace lingerie panties,\u201d according to the designer.",
      "While Wilde's outfit had a demure bohemian charm, actor Julia Fox leaned much further toward naked, arriving in a see-through wrap dress where the only adornment seemed to be strategically placed hair extensions.",
      "Doja Cat sang \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d on the telecast during a James Bond tribute segment in what looked like only diamonds, with little fabric in between. Then she showed up at the Vanity Fair party in a custom Balmain strapless gown with fringes, which the designer said \u201cwas crafted by 39 artisans over the course of 3,450 hours.\u201d The inspiration: an Oscar statue reflecting the female form \u2014 and that form was celebrated, beneath all the hand-threaded glass beads in nine different shades of gold.",
      "Kendall Jenner drew attention at the Vanity Fair fete with a vintage 1992 Mugler number in black lace that was actually made of rubber. \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d actor Leslie Bibb decided to go with the popular nude-sparkle look.",
      "Although the trend may feel somewhat new \u2014 as evidenced by the chatter around the recent Grammys carpet appearance by Bianca Censori and Ye \u2014 naked fashion has been in vogue for a number of years, noted Madeline Hirsch, features director at InStyle Fashion.",
      "\u201cThough it originated on the runway, the naked dress trend is fed largely by celebrity red carpet moments \u2014 stars and their stylists can\u2019t seem to get enough,\u201d Hirsch said in an email. She added that in 2025, sheer lace is the most prominent expression of the trend \u2014 not a surprise since bohemian style is resurgent.",
      "Though many Oscar attendees, of course, opt for much more traditional looks both before and after the ceremonies, it tends to be at the after-parties where the naked look pops up the most, Hirsch said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when attendees can let down their hair after hours, and generally speaking, it\u2019s a lower stakes red carpet and less formal event than the ceremony itself,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNext-to-naked dressing matches that energy.\u201d"

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "Opening the center on International Women's Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe's most restrictive laws.",
      "A small but loud group of protesters stood outside the center as activists gathered inside for its inauguration. The activists had private security guards, while police also separated the protesters from those inside.",

      "They also say they want to put pressure on politicians and to destigmatize abortion in a society where they say one in four women have had the procedure but it remains a taboo topic.",
      "The country's centrist prime minister, Donald Tusk, came to power in an election in 2023 in which he vowed to liberalize the country's abortion law. But the coalition he leads spans a broad ideological divide, with lawmakers on the left who want to legalize abortion and conservatives strongly opposed.",
      "Last year he acknowledged that he lacks the backing in parliament to change the law. Allowing abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy had been one of his campaign promises."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is set to answer Senate questions Thursday about his plans for the agency, which may soon be at the center of an administration plan to scrutinize vaccines, antidepressants and ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",

      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",
      "In government ethics forms, Makary recently said he has cut financial ties with several companies that could be impacted by his work at FDA, including telehealth and drug companies that sell compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs.",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the new measure",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the law.",
      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming is the first state to explicitly outlaw pill abortions, though that and other abortion bans over the past three years are on hold pending a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court.",
      "Ten other states require abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on women seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Under Wyoming's new law, pregnant women planning pill abortions will have to drive potentially long distances to get an ultrasound and have it documented. They would have the opportunity but not be required to view the image of the fetus at least 48 hours before a pill abortion.",
      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",
      "Pregnant woman who do not get an ultrasound will not be penalized under the new law, however. Instead it is medical providers who face up to $9,000 in fines and six months in jail for not arranging it.",
      "But there are few if any active abortion providers left. Last week the state's only full-service abortion clinic stopped providing any abortion care, surgical or medicinal, after Gordon signed a bill requiring such facilities to be licensed as surgical centers.",
      "Wellspring Health Access in Casper is wary of running afoul of the law while it challenges it and others in court, President Julie Burkhart said.",
      "It was not clear whether Wyoming's only other clinic providing medication abortions, a family medicine practice in Jackson, continues to do so. There was no response to phone messages left with the clinic seeking comment Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Pill abortions remain possible in the state through remote services: Women have access through the Just the Pill telehealth service and online providers such as Abuzz, The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, and Aid Access, according to Chelsea\u2019s Fund.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than 3 in 5 abortions carried out in the U.S. through the formal health care system in 2023 were medicinal. Wyoming had the biggest portion of abortions via pill that year: 19 in 20.",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case",
      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",
      "",
      "The AAP Red Book  --  an encyclopedia of pediatric infectious diseases  --  noted that U.S. experts concur with WHO recommendations on giving vitamin A to all children with measles, and recommends giving it once a day for 2 days at the following doses:",

      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",

      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment.

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is dropping an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of the administration\u2019s first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump's second term began",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",

      "The security guard was shot around 1 p.m. Sunday inside the emergency room at HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center, Scottsdale Police said in a news release.",
      "The shooting was the latest in a series of incidents of increasing violence against U.S. healthcare workers and highlighted the challenges of protecting them.",
      "The 30-year-old suspect was disarmed and detained by other members of the security team and staff before arriving officers arrested him, police said.",

      "Police said Yanofsky had been taken to HonorHealth Shea earlier in the day as a potential patient.",
      "No reason for the shooting was given. Police said officers were called about a disturbance in the emergency room that escalated to an altercation with security. Police said that during the altercation, Yanofsky took out a gun and shot the guard once in the upper body.",

It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",

      "The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.",
      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",

      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",

      "President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health is facing questions from a Senate panel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A health economist who famously clashed with officials at the National Institutes of Health faces Senate questioning Wednesday on his nomination to head that agency.",
      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",
      "He \u201chas a vision to restore faith in medical research for the American people,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the Senate health committee considering the nomination, wrote on X after meeting with Bhattacharya last month.",
      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",
      "Bhattacharya gained public attention as one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm and argued that people at low risk of COVID-19 should live normally while building up immunity through infection.",
      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",
      "Bhattacharya holds a medical degree but is not a practicing physician. His own research on the economics of health care has been funded by the NIH.",

      "Yet \u201call the people out there who have, you know, sick parents, sick children, this is going to impact,\u201d said neuroscientist Richard Huganir of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The administration\u2019s unprecedented moves are upending the research engine that has made the U.S. \u201cthe envy of the world in terms of scientific innovation,\u201d said Georgetown University health policy expert Lawrence Gostin.",
      "Among the biggest blows, if it survives a court challenge: Massive cuts in funding from the National Institutes of Health that would cost jobs in every state, according to an analysis by The Associated Press with assistance from the nonprofit United for Medical Research.",
      "That\u2019s on top of mass firings of government workers, NIH delays in issuing grants and uncertainty about how many already funded studies are being canceled under the president's anti-diversity executive orders.",
      "Earlier this week, lawmakers pressured Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the nominee to become NIH director, about the turmoil. Bhattacharya said if confirmed, he'd look into it to ensure scientists employed by and funded by the agency \u201chave resources to do the lifesaving work they do.\u201d",
      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",
      "After years studying the SynGap1 gene, \u201cwe have what we think is a really great therapeutic\u201d almost ready to be tested in severely affected children. Huganir has applied for two new NIH grants key for moving toward those trials.",

      "NIH reviews of new grant applications have been delayed despite court rulings to end a government spending freeze, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly they can get back on track.",
      "\u201cEveryone I know is basically freaking out because we suddenly don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to keep our labs open,\u201d said neuroscientist Rebecca Shansky at Boston\u2019s Northeastern University, who\u2019s awaiting word on grants for her study of how the brain processes pain and trauma.",

      "The Constitutional Court has been deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. If the court upholds his impeachment, a national election will be held to find his successor within two months.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said Friday it accepted Yoon\u2019s request to be released from prison, citing the need to address questions over the legality of the investigations on the president. Yoon\u2019s lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to probe rebellion charges.",
      "The Seoul court also said the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.",
      "Yoon\u2019s release came after prosecutors decided not to appeal the decision by the Seoul court. South Korean law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect while pursuing an appeal, even after his or her arrest is canceled by a court.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led Yoon\u2019s Dec. 14 impeachment, lashed out at the prosecutors\u2019 decision, calling them \u201chenchmen\u201d of Yoon, a former prosecutor general. Party spokesperson Cho Seung-rae urged the Constitutional Court to dismiss Yoon as soon as possible to avoid further public unrest and anxiety.",
      "At the heart of public criticism of Yoon over his martial law decree was his dispatch of hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly after placing the country under military rule. Some senior military and police officials sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to pull out lawmakers to thwart a parliamentary vote on the decree. Yoon has countered that he aimed to maintain order.",
      "Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted unanimously to overturn Yoon's decree.",
      "Investigators have alleged Yoon\u2019s martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he\u2019s convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that doesn't cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.",
      "Yoon has said he didn\u2019t intend to maintain martial law for long as he only attempted to inform the public of the danger of the Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda and impeached many senior officials and prosecutors. In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d",
      "South Korea's conservative-liberal divide is severe, and rallies either supporting or denouncing Yoon's impeachment have divided Seoul streets. Experts say whatever decision the Constitutional Court makes, the division is certain to worsen.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Malaria season begins this month in a large part of Africa. No disease is deadlier on the continent, especially for children. But the Trump administration's decision to terminate 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts has local health officials warning of catastrophe in some of the world\u2019s poorest communities.",
      "Dr. Jimmy Opigo, who runs Uganda\u2019s malaria control program, told The Associated Press that USAID stop-work orders issued in late January left him and others \u201cfocusing on disaster preparedness.\u201d The U.S. is the top bilateral funder of anti-malaria efforts in Africa.",
      "Anti-malarial medicines and insecticide-treated bed nets to help control the mosquito-borne disease are \u201clike our groceries,\u201d Opigo said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be continuous supply.\u201d",
      "As those dwindle with the U.S.-terminated contracts, he expects a rise in cases later this year of severe malaria, which includes problems like organ failure. There is no cure. Vaccines being rolled out in parts of Africa are imperfect but are expected to largely continue with the support of a global vaccine alliance.",
      "The Washington-based Malaria No More says new modeling shows that just a year of disruption in the malaria-control supply chain would lead to nearly 15 million additional cases and 107,000 additional deaths globally. It has urged the Trump administration to \u201crestart these life-saving programs before outbreaks get out of hand.\u201d",
      "Africa's 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Health workers in the three African nations most burdened by malaria \u2014 Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 described a cascade of effects with the end of most U.S. government support.",
      "The U.S. has provided hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the three countries alone through the USAID-led President\u2019s Malaria Initiative.",
      "The U.S. funding has often been channeled through a web of non-governmental organizations, medical charities and faith-based organizations in projects that made malaria prevention and treatment more accessible, even free, especially for rural communities.",
      "Uganda in 2023 had 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths, many of them children under 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Opigo said the U.S. has been giving between $30 million and $35 million annually for malaria control. He didn't say which contracts have been terminated but noted that field research was also affected.",
      "Some of the USAID funding in Uganda paid for mosquito-spraying operations in remote areas. Those operations were supposed to begin in February ahead of the rainy season, when stagnant water becomes breeding ground for the wide-ranging anopheles mosquito. They have been suspended.",
      "\u201cWe have to spray the houses before the rains, when the mosquitoes come to multiply,\u201d Opigo said.",
      "Already, long lines of malaria patients can be seen outside clinics in many areas every year. Malaria accounts for 30% to 50% of outpatient visits to health facilities across the country, according to Uganda National Institute of Public Health.",
      "Nigeria records a quarter of the world's malaria cases. But authorities have reduced malaria-related deaths there by 55% since 2000 with the support of the U.S. and others.",
      "That support is part of the $600 million in health assistance the west African country received from the U.S. in 2023, according to U.S. Embassy figures. It was not immediately clear whether all of that funding has stopped.",
      "The President\u2019s Malaria Initiative has supported Nigeria\u2019s malaria response with nearly 164 million fast-acting medicines, 83 million insecticide-treated bed nets, over 100 million rapid diagnostic tests, 22 million preventive treatments in pregnancy and insecticide for 121,000 homes since 2011, the embassy says.",
      "In Congo, U.S government funding has contributed about $650 million towards malaria control since 2010.",
      "Now, some of the successes in fighting malaria in Congo are being threatened, which will complicate already difficult efforts to identify and track disease outbreaks across the vast country as supplies and expertise for malaria testing are affected.",
      "Worsening conflict in Congo's east, where some health workers have fled, has raised the risk of infection, with little backup coming.",
      "With the loss of substantial U.S. support, \u201ca lot of people are going to be affected. Some people are really poor and cannot afford (malaria treatment),\u201d said Dr. Yetunde Ayo-Oyalowo, a Nigerian who runs the Market Doctors nonprofit providing affordable local healthcare services.",
      "Up to 40% of her organization's clients are diagnosed with malaria, Ayo-Oyalowo said.",
      "There is hope among health workers in Africa that, even after the dismantling of USAID, some U.S. funding will continue flowing via other groups including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. But that group also received U.S. support and has not issued a public statement on the dramatic cuts in U.S. aid.",
      "Opigo in Uganda said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health might be sources of help.",
      "But he added: \u201cWe need to manage the relationship with the U.S. very carefully.\"",

      "A Russian strike on a town in Ukraine\u2019s embattled Donetsk region has killed at least 11 people as a wave of heavy aerial attacks continued into the second night following a U.S. decision to stop sharing satellite images with Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A Russian strike on a town in Ukraine's embattled Donetsk region killed at least 11 people, officials said Saturday, as a wave of heavy aerial attacks continued into the second night following a U.S. decision to stop sharing satellite images with Ukraine.",
      "Thirty people were also reported injured in multiple strikes late Friday that damaged eight apartment blocks in the town of Dobropillya, which is close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances. Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said a Russian drone damaged a Ukrainian fire truck while rescuers fought to extinguish the burning buildings.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at least five children were among the injured. \u201cLast night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers. It is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort.\u201d",
      "The attack took place just 24 hours after Russia hit Ukrainian energy facilities with dozens of missiles and drones, hobbling its ability to deliver heat and light to its citizens and to power weapons factories vital to its defenses.",
      "The barrage came after the U.S. suspended military aid and intelligence to Ukraine to pressure it into accepting a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration.",
      "When asked Friday by a reporter during an Oval Office exchange if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, Trump responded: \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what anybody else would.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy did not reference the intelligence-sharing deal, but did seem to appeal to other statements Trump made Friday related to financial sanctions against Moscow. Writing on social media, the U.S. president proposed imposing large-scale banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and final peace settlement was reached.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the prospect of additional sanctions on Moscow, saying, \"Everything that helps Putin finance the war must be broken.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force reported Saturday that Russian troops launched three Iskander missiles and 145 drones over the country overnight. The bombardment contained a mix of attack and decoy drones intended to confuse air defenses. One missile and 79 drones were shot down, while 54 more drones were lost without causing damage, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "Among the targeted areas was Ukraine\u2019s northeastern region of Kharkiv, where three people died after a Russian drone hit a civilian workshop, emergency services said.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian troops shot down 31 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 26 over the country\u2019s Krasnodar region, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "Falling debris from one drone sparked a blaze at the KINEF oil refinery in Russia\u2019s northern Leningrad region, local Gov. Aleksandr Drozdenko said in a statement. No casualties were reported.",

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Foreign ministers from Muslim nations on Saturday rejected calls by U.S. President Donald Trump to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population and backed a plan for an administrative committee of Palestinians to govern the territory to allow reconstruction to go ahead.",
      "The foreign ministers gathered in the Saudi city of Jeddah for a special session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to address the situation in Gaza, at a time when the 7-week-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been thrown into doubt.",
      "In a statement put out Saturday, the gathering threw its support behind a plan to rebuild Gaza put forward by Egypt and backed by Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, aimed at countering Trump\u2019s call. The OIC groups 57 nations with largely Muslim populations.",
      "Without specifically mentioning Trump, the ministers said they rejected \u201cplans aimed at displacing the Palestinian people individually or collectively \u2026 as ethnic cleansing, a grave violation of international law and a crime against humanity.\u201d They also condemned \u201cpolicies of starvation\u201d that they said aim to push Palestinians to leave.",
      "The OIC also reinstated Syria as a member of the grouping.",
      "Syria was removed from the OIC in 2012 over then-President Bashar Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown on opposition protests. After some 14 years of civil war, Assad was ousted in December by Islamist-led insurgents who since have created a transitional government.",
      "The ceasefire that began in mid-January brought a pause in Israel\u2019s campaign of bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The ceasefire\u2019s first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages held by militants in Gaza and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the freeing of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "But an intended second phase of the deal \u2014 meant to bring the release of remaining hostages and a lasting truce and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2014 has been thrown into doubt. Israel has balked at entering negotiations over the terms of the second phase. Instead, it has called for Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in return for an extension of the ceasefire and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Since Sunday, Israel has barred all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies from entering Gaza for some 2 million people, demanding Hamas accept the revised deal.",
      "At the same time, Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population to be resettled elsewhere permanently so that the United States can take over the territory and develop it for others. Palestinians have rejected calls to leave.",
      "The ministers at the OIC gathering supported an Egyptian-backed proposal that an administrative committee replace Hamas in governing Gaza. The committee would work \u201cunder the umbrella\u201d of the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank. Israel has rejected the PA having any role in the Gaza Strip, but has not put forward an alternative for post-war rule in the territory.",
      "Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces have pulled back to a zone along Gaza\u2019s edges. Early Saturday, an Israeli strike killed two Palestinians in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said it struck several men who appeared to have been flying a drone that entered Israel from Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The campaign was triggered by Hamas\u2019 October 2023 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 34 others."

      "\u201cAs the food is cut, they will get less nutritious food, which may lead to a lack of nutrition. There will be social and mental pressure created amongst the Rohingya people in their community. They will have to look for an alternative for the food,\u201d he said.",

      "Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday",
      "BEIJING -- Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.",
      "The National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that the consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared to a year ago. On a monthly basis, prices were down 0.2% from January.",
      "While many other countries wrestle with inflation, China's policymakers face flat to falling prices, and the possibility they could evolve into a deflationary spiral that would drag down the economy. The government stressed the need to increase domestic demand and consumer spending in an annual report last week to its ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, but held back on unveiling any dramatic new steps to boost the economy.",
      "The Lunar New Year, a time when spending rises for travel, dining out and entertainment, came in late January this year instead of February, as it's based on the cycles of the moon. Holiday spending helped drive the consumer price index up 0.5% in January, but it then fell last month compared to 2024's elevated level.",
      "Factoring out the impact of the holiday, the index rose 0.1% last month, Dong Lijuan, a statistician at the government's statistics bureau, said in a written analysis.",
      "That is still far lower than ideal. Last week's government annual report included an inflation target of 2% for this year, but it is likely to fall far short of that goal. The consumer price index was flat in 2024, rising 0.2%.",
      "A burgeoning trade war with the United States could add to China's economic headwinds.",
      "Besides the early Lunar New Year, two other factors contributed to falling prices in February, Dong said: Better weather boosted farm production, driving down the price of fresh vegetables and automakers also stepped up promotions to try to boost sales, reducing prices for new cars.",
      "The producer price index, which measures the wholesale price of goods, fell 2.2% in February, the statistics bureau said. Producer prices have been falling more sharply than consumer prices, putting pressure on companies to cut labor and other costs."

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Female students on Saturday marked International Women's Day in Serbia by leading the daily street protests against corruption and sending a message decrying widespread violence against women in the Balkan country.",
      "University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people.",
      "Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell down because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. Street demonstrations have become a challenge to the populist President Aleksandar Vucic.",
      "The students carried a banner reading: \u201cWomen in front rows,\" heading the marching column that passed through central streets in Belgrade and by the building hosting the state prosecutor's office.",
      "The protesters held 19 minutes of silence, instead of the 15 held normally for the 15 victims of the canopy crash. The additional four minutes were dedicated to the four women killed in domestic violence in Serbia this year.",
      "\u201dI am here to support all women around the world, all mothers and fighters, and students of course,\" said Slavica Djajic, a resident of Belgrade.",
      "The protesting university students have insisted on full accountability in the canopy fall, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions.",
      "Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.",
      "The next big rally is planned on March 15 in Belgrade and Vucic alleged that \u201cthey will try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end.\u201d He added that \u201cmany (demonstrators) will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts.\u201d",
      "All student-led protests in the past months have been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.",
      "The populist leader and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for over a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union entry for Serbia.",
      "Authorities have indicted 16 people over the canopy collapse, but many doubt that the actual culprits will face justice."

      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "The death toll from two days of clashes between security forces and loyalists of ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad and revenge killings that followed has risen to more than 600, a war monitoring group said Saturday, making it one of the deadliest acts of violence since Syria\u2019s conflict began 14 years ago.",
      "The clashes, which erupted Thursday, marked a major escalation in the challenge to the new government in Damascus, three months after insurgents took authority after removing Assad from power.",
      "The government has said that they were responding to attacks from remnants of Assad's forces and blamed \u201cindividual actions\u201d for the rampant violence.",
      "The revenge killings that started Friday by Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government against members of Assad\u2019s minority Alawite sect are a major blow to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the overthrow of the former government. Alawites made up a large part of Assad\u2019s support base for decades.",
      "Residents of Alawite villages and towns spoke to The Associated Press about killings during which gunmen shot Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes of Alawites were looted and then set on fire in different areas, two residents of Syria\u2019s coastal region told the AP from their hideouts.",
      "They asked that their names not be made public out of fear of being killed by gunmen, adding that thousands of people have fled to nearby mountains for safety.",
      "Residents of Baniyas, one of the towns worst hit by the violence, said bodies were strewn on the streets or left unburied in homes and on the roofs of buildings, and nobody was able to collect them. One resident said that the gunmen prevented residents for hours from removing the bodies of five of their neighbors killed Friday at close range.",
      "Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of Baniyas who fled with his family and neighbors hours after the violence broke out Friday, said that at least 20 of his neighbors and colleagues in one neighborhood of Baniyas where Alawites lived, were killed, some of them in their shops, or in their homes.",
      "Sheha called the attacks \u201crevenge killings\u201d of the Alawite minority for the crimes committed by Assad's government. Other residents said the gunmen included foreign fighters, and militants from neighboring villages and towns.",
      "\u201cIt was very very bad. Bodies were on the streets,\u201d as he was fleeing, Sheha said, speaking by phone from nearly 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the city. He said the gunmen were gathering less than 100 meters from his apartment building, firing randomly at homes and residents and in at least one incident he knows of, asked residents for their IDs to check their religion and their sect before killing them. He said the gunmen also burned some homes and stole cars and robbed homes.",
      "The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said that 428 Alawites have been killed in revenge attacks in addition to 120 pro-Assad fighters and 89 from security forces. The Observatory\u2019s chief Rami Abdurrahman said that revenge killings stopped early Saturday.",
      "\u201cThis was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,\u201d Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians.",
      "The previous figure given by the group was more than 200 dead. No official figures have been released.",
      "A funeral was held Saturday afternoon for four Syrian security force members in the northwestern village of Al-Janoudiya after they were killed in the clashes along Syria's coast. Scores of people attended the funeral.",
      "Syria\u2019s state news agency quoted an unnamed Defense Ministry official as saying that government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. It added that authorities have closed all roads leading to the coastal region \u201cto prevent violations and gradually restore stability.\u201d",
      "On Saturday morning, the bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks the day before in the central village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said. Those killed included nine children and four women, the residents said, sending the AP photos of the bodies draped in white cloth as they were lined in the mass grave.",
      "Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser, who holds one of the two seats allocated to the Alawite sect in parliament, said that people were fleeing from Syria for safety in Lebanon. He said he didn't have exact numbers.",
      "Nasser said that many people were sheltering at the Russian air base in Hmeimim, Syria, adding that the international community should protect Alawites who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country. He said that since Assad\u2019s fall, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed.",
      "Under Assad, Alawites held top posts in the army and security agencies. The new government has blamed his loyalists for attacks against the country\u2019s new security forces over the past several weeks.",
      "The most recent clashes started when government forces tried to detain a wanted person near the coastal city of Jableh, and were ambushed by Assad loyalists, according to the Observatory.",

      "Maasai girls are taking up martial arts to protect themselves from sexual abuse and violence stemming from early marriage",
      "KILGORIS, Kenya -- KILGORIS, Kenya (AP) \u2014 \u201cI am worth defending!\u201d a group of girls chant as they each take up a fighting stance.",
      "They are about to practice combat techniques. And no, they are not part of a martial arts club. They are Maasai girls living at a boarding school in Transmara in western Kenya, which doubles up as a rescue center for teens who have escaped early marriage and female genital mutilation.",
      "\u201cWe learn how to protect ourselves, how to protect our bodies,\u201d said Grace Musheni, 14, who has been living and studying at the Enkakenya Centre for Excellence since 2023.",
      "The center was set up in 2009 by Kakenya Ntaiya, a Maasai woman who was subjected to genital cutting herself. It doesn\u2019t just offer a safe haven for girls at risk of early marriage: it also provides a free high school education as an incentive for parents to allow their daughters to stay in school instead of undergoing the cutting ritual that is still common for Maasai girls between the ages of 8 and 17.",
      "Once a girl is circumcised, she is considered an adult and ripe for marriage, meaning an abrupt end to childhood and education for many.",
      "\u201cMost child marriages are caused by poverty in families,\u201d Musheni explains. \u201cBecause of this poverty, you can get that a parent can allow their daughter to be married by an old man \u2014 because the family can be paid.\u201d",
      "While Ntaiya was unable to escape genital mutilation herself, she convinced her father to allow her to continue her education, and she now holds a Ph.D. in education from the University of Pittsburgh and multiple awards for her work.",
      "\u201cI am a beneficiary of proper education and I really wanted to show my community how important it is to empower women and girls,\u201d she says.",
      "Although Kenyan law prohibits genital mutilation and marriage below age 18, both are still practiced, especially in rural areas where education levels remain low. The 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey by the government found that 56.3% of women with no education had undergone genital mutilation, compared to 5.9% of women who had studied past secondary school.",
      "Girls\u2019 education apparently has an impact on gender-based violence too, with 34% of Kenyan women surveyed saying they were victims of physical violence, a figure that drops to 23% for women with education.",
      "But that is still alarmingly high. So on top of providing education, the Enkakenya Centre partners with I\u2019m Worth Defending to teach combative self-defense skills. It\u2019s not so much so that they can physically fight potential abusers \u2014- although they could \u2014 but it teaches them to be assertive in all areas of their lives.",
      "\u201cWe train them with basic principles of assertiveness and boundary setting, which includes verbal and physical techniques,\u201d says Amelia Awuor from I\u2019m Worth Defending. \u201cThese skills instill confidence to speak up against violations or fight off physical threats.\u201d",
      "The training gave 14-year-old Rahab Lepishoi power to speak up for other girls. During a recent visit to her older sister, she learned that the girls in the village were about to be circumcised, including an old childhood friend. \u201cI told her about the dangers of FGM and to come with me to my home to avoid (it),\u201d Lepishoi says.",
      "She is following in the footsteps of her educators, who visit remote communities in Transmara every year to raise awareness about genital mutilation, early marriage and the importance of education. \u201cNow when I go to a place, I apply that skill of assertiveness and confidence. I educate my friends, so that when they meet with a boy, they will be confident and say what they mean,\u201d says Lepishoi.",
      "The self-defense classes also offer some protection against sexual abuse, which can end up trapping many in violent marriages. \u201cWhen a girl reports to her parents that she has been abused, it is common for the parents to force the girl to marry the man that abused her,\u201d said Musheni.",
      "Purity Risanoi, 15, has been at the school for five years. Her mother is a widow and raised her five children alone, but cultural pressures from her community remain. \u201cMy family is still very traditional,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a girl grows up, she is expected to get married and she cannot choose who to marry.\u201d",
      "Her solution? Keep studying. One day, she wants to be a lawyer.",
      "Musheni meanwhile dreams of a career as a software engineer. She wants to come back here and use technology to uplift her community. \u201cGirls can achieve great things,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to inspire others to chase their dreams.\u201d",

      "PANAMA CITY -- After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation.",
      "It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.",
      "\u201cWe are refugees. We do not have money. We can not pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,\u201d Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?\"",
      "Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don\u2019t know what they will do.",
      "Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration \u201cto send a signal of deterrence\u201d to people hoping to migrate.",
      "Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp.",
      "Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.",
      "\u201cOnce I get off the bus, I'll be sleeping on the ground tonight,\" Gaponov said.",
      "Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.",
      "The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin.",
      "Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process.",
      "The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries.",
      "Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution.",
      "Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama's border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next.",
      "Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into \u201cblack holes\u201d for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism.",
      "Those who were released Saturday night, like Omagh, said they could not return home.",
      "As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban \u2014 which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country \u2014 would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.",
      "Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied.",
      "\u201cMy hope was freedom. Just freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn't give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me \u2018No, no, no, no, no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities.",
      "In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards.",
      "Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.",
      "While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn\u2019t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.",
      "Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with a Afghan passport.",
      "He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that \u201cwe do not accept asylum.\u201d",
      "\u201cNone of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,\u201d said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama\u2019s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis entered his fourth week in the hospital with double pneumonia, increasingly handing off his day-to-day duties to cardinals as questions swirl about the near and long-term future of his papacy.",
      "On Saturday, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, took Francis' place to celebrate Mass for a pro-life group. On Sunday, another Vatican official, Cardinal Michael Czerny, is stepping in for the pope to celebrate a Holy Year Mass for volunteers.",
      "There is no reason why such delegation of papal obligations cannot continue, especially since Francis remains conscious and working from the hospital. But the 88-year-old pope has spoken about the possibility of resignation, though his position has changed over time, especially after the death of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "Here's what Francis has said about pope's retiring, in his own words:",
      "In his 2024 memoir, Life, Francis recounted how he first learned about Benedict\u2019s resignation, the first in 600 years. He said a Vatican journalist had called him in Buenos Aires on Feb. 11, 2013, and told him the news as it was breaking.",
      "\u201cFor a moment I was paralyzed. I could hardly believe what I was hearing,\u201d Francis wrote in Life. \u201cThis was news I had never expected to receive in my lifetime: the resignation of a pope was unimaginable, although it was provided for in canon law. In the first few moments I said to myself, \u2018I must have misunderstood, it\u2019s not possible.\u2019 But then I understood that Benedict had surely meditated and prayed for a long time before making this brave and historic decision. Faced with his declining strength, he had evidently realized that the only irreplaceable element in the Church is the Holy Spirit, and the only Lord is Jesus Christ. This is why he was a great pope, humble and sincere, who loved the church until the end.\u201d",
      "During the 10 years they lived together in the Vatican as a reigning and retired pope, Francis repeatedly praised Benedict\u2019s courage and humility for resigning and said he had \u201copened the door\u201d to future popes also stepping down.",
      "In a 2022 interview with Spain's ABC daily, Francis revealed that he had written a letter of resignation soon after he was elected pontiff. The letter laid out his resignation if medical problems impeded him from carrying out his duties or from freely announcing a resignation.",
      "The text of the letter has not been released and it\u2019s not known what sort of medical impairment or lack of consciousness might trigger a resignation. Canon law has no provision for what to do if a pope is permanently impaired and canonists are divided on whether a pre-written letter of resignation would be valid.",

      "\u201cBut this is, I repeat, a distant possibility, because I truly do not have any cause serious enough to make me think of resigning,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people may have hoped that sooner or later, perhaps after a stay in the hospital, I might make an announcement of that kind, but there is no risk of it: Thanks be to God, I enjoy good health, and as I have said, there are many projects to bring to fruition, God willing.\u201d",
      "Benedict died Dec. 31, 2022, at age of 95. There were not a few problems during those 10 years of cohabitation, with traditionalists and conservatives looking to Benedict as their nostalgic point of reference.",
      "In his first interview with The Associated Press after the death, Francis again repeated that Benedict had opened up the possibility of future retired popes. He repeated that if he were to follow, he would live outside the Vatican in a home for retired priests in the diocese of Rome and be referred to as the \u201cemeritus bishop of Rome\u201d as opposed to \u201cemeritus pope.\u201d",

      "But a few weeks later, speaking to Congolese and South Sudanese priests, Francis changed tune. Freed from Benedict's presence, Francis pointed out the risks that papal resignations become the norm. He repeated that he had written a letter of resignation, but made clear the papacy was for life.",
      "\u201cI did it in case I have some health problem that prevents me from exercising my ministry and I am not fully conscious in order to resign,\u201d he said, according to the closed-door comments reported by the Jesuit journal La Civilta Cattolica.",
      "\u201cHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that resigning popes should become, let\u2019s say, a \u2018fashion,\u2019 or a normal thing. Benedict had the courage to do it because he didn\u2019t feel like going on because of his health. I for the moment do not have that on my agenda. I believe that the pope\u2019s ministry is ad vitam (for life). I see no reason why it shouldn\u2019t be so. The ministry of the great patriarchs is always for life. And historical tradition is important.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf, on the other hand, we listen to the gossip well, then we should change popes every six months!\u201d",

      "State-run media in Myanmar say the head of the military government has declared the country will hold a general election within 10 months",
      "BANGKOK -- Four years after seizing power from the elected administration, the head of the military government declared Myanmar will hold a general election within 10 months, state-run media reported Saturday.",
      "Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said Friday the election will take place either in December or January 2026 at the latest, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. He announced the dates in a press conference while on an official visit to Belarus, one of the few allies of Myanmar\u2019s military government, saying that 53 political parties have already submitted their lists to participate in the election.",
      "However, Min Aung did not mention exact election dates.",
      "The announcement comes as Myanmar is roiled by a civil war in which the army has been forced onto the defensive against pro-democracy militants as well as ethnic militias seeking autonomy in much of the country.",
      "The army takeover from Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government in February 2021 has been met with widespread popular opposition, triggering armed resistances, and large parts of the country are embroiled in conflict. The ruling military has since said an election was the primary goal but has repeatedly pushed back the date.",
      "The plan for a general election is widely seen as an attempt to normalize the military\u2019s seizure of power through the ballot box and to deliver a result that ensures the generals retain control.",
      "Critics have already said the military-planned election will be neither free nor fair because there is no free media and most of the leaders of Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy party have been arrested. Suu Kyi, 79, is serving prison sentences totaling 27 years after being convicted in a series of politically tainted prosecutions brought by the military.",
      "The country\u2019s current security situation poses a serious challenge to holding elections, with the military believed to control less than half the country. The military government had previously said the election would be prioritized in areas under its command.",
      "In October, the military attempted a census that it said was to compile voter lists for a general election, but data from only 145 of 330 townships was successfully gathered. In a published report, the military government said the areas where the census could not be completed included towns controlled by ethnic armed forces and pro-democracy guerrillas.",
      "The National Unity Government or NUG, Myanmar's main opposition organization, said it intended to prevent the military-held election through nonviolent means."

      "St. Paul\u2019s Lutheran church in Helsinki has held the first church service in Finland created mostly by artificial intelligence",
      "HELSINKI -- A tale of good versus evil played out on the large screen in the sanctuary of St. Paul\u2019s Lutheran church in Finland. Jesus was shown in robes with long hair and a beard, while Satan was dressed in more modern clothes but with a menacing frown and higher-pitched voice \u2014 all created by artificial intelligence.",
      "Also addressing the flock at the Tuesday evening service were avatars of the church\u2019s pastors and a former president of Finland who died in 1986, reading from the Old Testament.",
      "It was the first church service in Finland put together mostly by AI tools, which wrote the sermons and some of the songs, composed the music and created the visuals.",
      "The widely advertised experimental service drew over 120 people to the church in northeastern Helsinki, much more than on a typical weeknight. People came from out of town as did a handful of foreigners who admitted they didn\u2019t speak Finnish well enough to understand it all.",
      "\u201cUsually when people talk about AI, they are talking about what AI can do in the future. But the future is now. \u2026 AI can do all those things that people think that it can maybe do in 10 years or so,\u201d said the Rev. Petja Kopperoinen, who came up with the idea and brought it to fruition.",
      "The clergy and worshippers said they enjoyed it, but agreed it wouldn't replace services led by humans anytime soon.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty entertaining and fun, but it didn\u2019t feel like a Mass or a service. \u2026 It felt distant. I didn\u2019t feel like they were talking to me,\u201d Taru Nieminen told The Associated Press.",
      "The Rev. Kari Kanala, the vicar at St. Paul's, echoed her sentiment.",
      "\u201cThe warmth of the people is what people need,\u201d he said.",
      "Churches and pastors around the world have been experimenting with AI, just like the rest of the society, to try to understand what role it could play in their lives \u2014 and if it can attract more worshippers.",
      "In 2023, an AI-led service was held in a church in Germany. Last year, an avatar of \u201cJesus\u201d on a computer screen in a Catholic chapel in Switzerland took questions from believers and offered responses based on Scripture.",
      "St. Paul\u2019s church likes to try new things, with pastors incorporating screenings of soccer and ice hockey matches into their services, along with dance and film festivals.",
      "After attending a conference on AI and religion in Geneva and hearing about the service in Germany, Kopperoinen says he thought: Why not try it?",
      "Kanala was on board, as was Bishop Teemu Laajasalo of Helsinki.",
      "Kopperoinen worked for weeks with different AI tools to assemble the 45-minute service, including Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT-4o to write the words, except for those from the Bible; Suno to compose the tunes, similar to pop music; and the Synthesia AI platform to create video avatars of himself, Kanala and another pastor from existing footage.",
      "Seeing himself onscreen speaking words he never said in real life felt \u201ceerie,\u201d Kopperoinen said.",
      "Another tool, Akool, meanwhile, created the avatar of former Finnish President Urho Kekkonen reading from the Old Testament, and the exchange between Satan and Jesus.",
      "In between AI-produced elements, clergy and worshippers sang hymns with live organ music.",
      "The exercise had clear limits. AI was not involved in forgiving sins at the Helsinki service, and the Eucharist was not performed.",
      "Any output needs to be fact-checked and edited by a human, and AI copy is often based on stereotypes, Kopperoinen said.",
      "AI tools generally seemed reluctant to compose religious content, he said. ChatGPT initially wouldn't write dialogue between Jesus and Satan and went along with it only after Kopperoinen assured it that he was a Lutheran pastor and there was nothing wrong with writing it.",
      "ChatGPT also refused to give absolution or blessings, which is a good guardrail, Kanala said, \"because somehow it can divide things which are very intimate and religious.\u201d",
      "Kopperoinen also said he was aware of the impact of AI tools on the environment, including, for example, the amount of water used to power them. Some in the Finnish Lutheran church criticized St. Paul's for using AI to entertain people at the cost of the environment, he said.",
      "Worshippers said they found the service different, interesting and entertaining, but also confusing at times. Speech patterns were rapid and hard to follow.",
      "\u201cI did like the songs. They were really catchy, although they lacked the kind of soul the humans have,\" said student Jeera Pulkkinen, who disliked the tools' fast delivery of the text.",
      "Eeva Salonen, chief development officer at the Helsinki Parish Union, said the service felt \u201cmore like a performance,\u201d finding it more impersonal than \u201cit would be with real people.\u201d",
      "\"But I really liked it,\u201d she added.",
      "The need for a human element is one of the reasons AI is unlikely to replace real pastors, Kopperoinen said.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t be empathetic towards people. AI can\u2019t really answer your questions in a spiritual way,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, both Kopperoinen and Kanala believe there is a place in the church for AI. St. Paul's already uses it for bookkeeping, and Kopperoinen sometimes turns to ChatGPT to help him compose sermons or when he needs to find verses on a particular topic.",
      "Kanala admits he has \"always opposed\u201d AI, but decided to confront it head-on and now thinks it can help clergy on things like research for sermons and speeches.",
      "Tom Stoneham, a University of York philosophy professor and an ethicist with the Center for Doctoral Training in Safe AI Systems in the U.K., notes AI can replace humans only \u201cwhere the function of the human is purely instrumental\u201d and transactional, such as \u201cin customer service situations.\"",
      "Even in these situations, however, a smile or a brief friendly exchange adds value that AI can\u2019t, Stoneham said.",
      "In a religious setting, \u201cit\u2019s about the human, not an instrument. They\u2019re not just a mere means to achieving something,\" he said. \"It\u2019s that humanity that is adding value to the situation.\u201d",
      "Anna Puzio, a researcher on ethics of technology at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, said that given the concerns with AI, it\u2019s important for churches and religious groups to experiment with it. That way they can help \u201cshape these AI processes and develop AI and design it in a responsible way,\u201d she said.",

      "A nuclear-powered submarine was among a long wishlist of sophisticated weaponry that Kim vowed to introduce during a major political conference in 2021 to cope with what he called escalating U.S.-led military threats. Other weapons were solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons, spy satellites and multi-warhead missiles.

      "The idea was conceived by seasoned hotelier Chandra Wickramasinghe, who said he was \u201cinspired by the power of women,\" especially that of his mother who raised him and his seven siblings as a single parent.",
      "\u201cI knew what these ladies can do. I got the idea and put my team to work on it. We got a strong team to run it and it worked very well,\u201d said Wickramasinghe, adding that the resort would enable women to thrive as leaders.",
      "Social stigma, language barrier, work-life balance, lack of training facilities and low salaries have long kept the majority of Sri Lankan women away from the hospitality industry, especially those in the rural areas, said Suranga Silva, professor of tourism economics in the University of Colombo.",
      "Much of this stems from a patriarchal structure and traditional gender roles deeply embedded in Sri Lanka\u2019s society, even though many women have made their mark in the country's politics and have held key positions in the government. The island nation's current prime minister, Harini Amarasuriya, is a woman.",
      "\u201cTourism industry can\u2019t be isolated from women,\u201d said Silva, adding that women\u2019s employment in Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism is very low compared to the global and regional levels.",
      "Sri Lanka's tourism and hospitality sector contributed 2.3% to the country's economy in 2023 \u2014 down from 5% in 2018 \u2014 and the industry has traditionally been the country\u2019s third largest foreign exchange earner. But the shortage of skilled women and some of them leaving jobs after getting married have been challenges faced by the industry since the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings and the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Kaushalya Batagoda, the executive chef at the resort, said the industry faces a shortage of female professionals to serve in the kitchen and as a result, most staff recruited to the resort's kitchen were rookies still in training.",
      "\"But, the new generation has a passion for working in the kitchen,\" she said, adding that she gets a lot of applications from women.",
      "The resort has been lauded by women\u2019s rights activists who have long been concerned about limited career choices for women in Sri Lanka.",
      "Activist Sepali Kottegoda said such business enterprises can \"open up more safe employment opportunities for women.\u201d",
      "Silva, the professor, said that \u201ca dramatic change\u201d is taking place as more young women are eager to join the industry, but suggested that the government and the sector must jointly provide training programs for women to improve their skills and employability.",
      "At Amba Yaalu resort, some of these concerns are already being tackled.",
      "\u201cThis is purely to empower women,\" Adikari said. \u201cWe invite women to come and join us, see whether they can perform better in the career, sharpen their capacities and skills and contribute to the industry.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 is baffling businesses and causing them to delay or cancel the investments that help drive economic growth",
      "WASHINGTON -- Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois is getting ready to introduce a fancy ergonomic chair designed to reduce customers\u2019 back pain and boost their productivity. He figures the most expensive one will sell for more than $1,000. But he can\u2019t settle on a price, and he is reluctantly reducing the shipment he\u2019s bringing to the United States from China.",
      "There\u2019s a reason for his caution: President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "The latest reversal came Thursday. Two days after imposing 25% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on all imports from Canada and Mexico and threatening to detonate more than $1.3 billion in annual U.S. trade in North America, Trump announced that he was suspending many of the levies on Mexico and some of them on Canada for a month. This was an expansion of his Wednesday announcement when he exempted auto imports from both countries for 30 days, and it also comes after a previous monthlong tariff reprieve for Canada and Mexico right before they were to take effect Feb. 4.",
      "\u201cTrump is jerking around the entire continent of North America right now, it\u2019s stupid and it has to stop,\" Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said. \"Today there are businesses that don\u2019t even know if the goods they trade in are subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Everything Trump does on trade seems designed to maximize chaos and uncertainty.",
      "Rosenberg and his ergonomic furniture, meanwhile, are contending with a 20% tariff on imports from China \u2013 which Trump on Tuesday raised from 10% -- but he\u2019s not sure where the tariff will actually land.",
      "\u201cThe misdirection is making it very tough to plan for the year,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they\u2019re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also draw retaliation from trading partners, which can hurt all economies involved.",
      "But import taxes can cause economic damage in another way: by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories, what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.",
      "\u201cIt creates an enormous amount of uncertainty for multinational companies that sell products worldwide, that import from the rest of the world, that run these complex supply chains through multiple countries,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. \u201cThe uncertainty is going to be very unsettling for businesses and ... it will hurt business investment.''",
      "During Trump\u2019s first-term trade battles, U.S. business investment weakened late in 2019, convincing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three times in second half of the year to provide some offsetting economic stimulus.",
      "Trump 2.0 is even more unnerving to business. The first Trump administration imposed tariffs on specific targets \u2014 steel and aluminum and most goods from China \u2014 after lengthy investigations.",
      "This time, Trump has invoked his power to declare a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants across U.S. borders \u2014 to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China with the stroke of a pen. And he\u2019s expanded his targets. Next month, for example, he intends to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u2019\u2019 on countries that charge higher import taxes than America does.",
      "\u201cJust the threat of those tariff increases and potential retaliations are putting a brake on \u2014 on investment, on consumption decisions, on employment, hiring, all the rest of it,\u2019\u2019 European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said after the ECB cut interest rates Thursday to support Europe\u2019s struggling economy.",
      "His tariffs on Canada and Mexico effectively blow up a 2020 North American trade deal he negotiated himself five years ago. \u201cPast trade agreements simply don\u2019t mean much if the president can unilaterally violate them and impose tariffs with no checks at all,\u201d said Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty: It\u2019s unclear what Trump is trying to achieve by plastering tariffs on American trading partners. Sometimes he cites border security. Sometimes he emphasizes the revenue that tariffs can generate for the Treasury \u2014 money that can help finance his proposed tax cuts. Sometimes he points to America\u2019s big trade deficits with most other countries.",
      "Since the goals are cloudy, it\u2019s hard to see what it will take to make Trump\u2019s tariffs go away.",
      "Not only that, but he\u2019s imposed the tariffs erratically, creating even more confusion. For instance, his administration had to reverse itself last month after ending a customs loophole \u2013 the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption -- allowing duty-free entry into the United States of packages from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800. Turned out, the U.S. postal service needed more time to figure out how to collect the duties.",
      "Businesses are baffled. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to multiple companies that are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not moving forward with any investment. We need this to be settled,\u2019\u201d said trade lawyer Gregory Husisian at the law firm Foley & Lardner. At least in Trump\u2019s first term \u201cthey knew what the ground rules were. Now they don\u2019t know if we\u2019re playing Monopoly or tic-tac-toe.\u2019\u2019",
      "Respondents to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing survey, out Monday, voiced complaints about the tariff uncertainty. \u201cThere is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it\u2019s harder to project how they will affect business,\u201d a transportation equipment company said. A chemicals firm griped: \u201cThe tariff environment regarding products from Mexico and Canada has created uncertainty and volatility among our customers.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cRight now, the tariffs are putting everybody off balance because of their unpredictability and uncertainty,\u201d said John Gulliver, president of the New England-Canada Business Council.",
      "Taylor Samuels, the owner of Las Almas Rotas, a bar and restaurant in Dallas, depends on Mexico for much of the alcohol he offers.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, including the potential impact on the price of raw materials like steel and lumber, are forcing him to review his plans to build a new restaurant.",
      "\u201cThat construction budget is now under review and may likely be delayed ... as I recalculate costs that have already been budgeted,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Sandya Dandamudi of GI Stone, a stone supplier in Chicago, said builders are having to rethink their plans.",
      "\u201cDevelopers of commercial projects like high-rises and hotels budget two years in advance, so they don\u2019t account for new tariffs,\u201d she said. \u201cThose budgets will be blown.\u2019\u2019",
      "Dandamudi said that companies will either succeed in passing the tariffs along to their customers or they will be forced to cancel projects.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs will be devastating for small businesses like ours,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing forward, we won\u2019t be able to sign any new contracts unless clients address the tariffs.\u201d",
      "Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, that sells Canadian whisky and other specialty spirits, said her plans for the future have been put on hold due to the tariffs. Her original plan for 2025 was to almost double her inventory and the selection she offered.",
      "\u201cFor now, we have no plans of adding more shelving or space for new items, we will stick to the footprint we have,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will delay the growth of our business, making us a bit stagnant.\u2019\u2019",

      "Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going.",
      "But the same factors that have pulled mortgage rates to their lowest level since December \u2014 signs that the U.S. economy is slowing and uncertainty over the potential fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports \u2014 are clouding the outlook for where mortgage rates will go from here.",
      "\u201cWe do not anticipate significant relief from high mortgage rates in the near future because of inflation remaining stubbornly high, which will not be helped by the tariffs that the Trump administration appears committed to rolling out,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. has declined six weeks in a row from 7.04% in mid-January to 6.76% last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year earlier, it averaged 6.94%.",
      "The average rate is now at its lowest level since Dec. 19, when it was 6.72%. It briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but remains more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates echoes moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 4.79% in mid-January, has been mostly easing since then, reflecting worries about the economy\u2019s growth and the potential impact from the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on several of the country's biggest trading partners.",
      "While one could say the bond market jitters have ultimately benefited home shoppers by leading to lower mortgage rates, the trajectory for rates from here is far from certain.",
      "Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That\u2019s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated.",
      "And then there\u2019s the Fed, which has signaled a more cautious approach as it gauges where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue.",
      "So far, the steady decline in mortgage rates this year hasn\u2019t been enough to drive home sales higher. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in January as rising mortgage rates and prices froze out many would-be homebuyers despite a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "Pending home sales, a bellwether for future completed sales, point to potentially further sales declines in coming months. They slid to an all-time low in January.",
      "Still, last week, mortgage applications jumped 20.4% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And a measure of home loan refinancing applications surged 37%, the MBA said.",
      "While a pickup in mortgage applications is typical for this time of year, the sharp increase is a signal that mortgage rates have fallen enough to spur some buyers off the fence.",
      "The pullback in rates comes at a good time for home shoppers. The inventory of homes on the market has risen sharply from a year ago and prices are rising more slowly nationally and declining in many metropolitan areas, such as Austin, Dallas and Tampa, Florida.",
      "Still, more attractive mortgage rates may not be enough to motivate home shoppers if the economy and labor market worsen.",
      "\u201cInflation is still a problem, but now the economy is starting to show signs of weakness,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cWhat that means to the housing market is that those two factors make buyers more reluctant to jump into the market.\u201d"

Tariffs risk reigniting inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher.",
      "The U.S. slapped 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. It also doubled the tariff Trump announced last month on Chinese products, to 20%.",
      "Possibly raising anxiety further, certain aspects of U.S. trade policy appears to be fluid, making it more difficult for businesses and households to plan ahead. On Wednesday, Trump reversed course and granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers.",
      "Macy's executives emphasized that the company is facing lots of uncertainty given the ever-changing tariff policies. But the company is focusing on what it can control and zeroing in on improving its merchandise and services. Company executives told analysts on the earnings call Thursday that Macy's has been working with its suppliers to increase variety and reduce redundant styles, while adding more exclusive offerings. It's also focusing on improving its store label brands.",
      "\u201cWe are in that retail therapy business, a place of escapism, an opportunity to get away from all of the political noise that happens every day,\u201d Macy's CEO Tony Spring said. \"And we have to lean into that. And so, I don\u2019t think the consumer is going to feel a sense of relief in the short term. I\u2019m not an economist, I can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019ll go on. I challenge our teams every day to think about what do we control?\"",
      "The uncertainty comes as retailers like Macy's were already dealing with cautious consumer spending though sales at the department store have been improving.",
      "Macy's, which also runs Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reported net income of $342 million, or $1.21 per share, for the three-month period ended Feb. 1. Adjusted per-share earnings per were $1.80, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.54 per share, according to FactSet, and reversing a $128 million loss last year.",
      "Sales fell 4.3% to $7.77 billion from $8.12 billion in the year-ago period.",
      "Comparable sales at the overall company\u2014 established business from physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 0.2%. At Macy's nameplate stores, comparable store sales dipped 1.9%.",
      "Macy's has been on a campaign to modernize stores, and that appears to be working. At the first 50 stores that have been upgraded, comparable sales rose 1.2%. Those initiatives \u2014 which include offering more service in shoe departments and more visual displays\u2014 have been added to another 75 stores.",
      "Macy's other brands continue to excel, with comparable sales growth at Bloomingdale\u2019s hitting 6.5%, while Bluemercury reported its 16th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth, the latest at of 6.2%.",
      "Macy's expects to earn $2.05 to $2.25 per share on net revenue of $21 billion to $21.4 billion in the current year. Analysts expect a profit of $2.29 per share on sales of $21.34 billion.",

      "Congress chose three nonprofits to distribute the grants, but HUD said in letters that it was cancelling contracts with two of the organizations which together were to distribute the $60 million. That's pushed millions in funding already promised to small nonprofits, or yet to be awarded, into the twilight zone.",
      "\u201cMany of those organizations have already committed funds to pay workers, such as HVAC technicians, local contractors, homeownership counselors,\u201d said Shaun Donovan, CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, one of the two groups whose contract was cancelled.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders are trumpeting their endorsement of a plan to free up hundreds of billions of euros to inject into their defense budgets after the Trump administration warned that the continent must look after its own security, including Ukraine, in future.",
      "After more than 12 hours of talks on Thursday, the 27 leaders signed off on a scheme that would ease budget restrictions for defense spending, funnel some of the EU\u2019s unused funds toward security priorities and provide 150 billion euros ($162 billion) in loans for military purchases.",
      "As a priority, the funds would be spent on air and missile defense, artillery systems, ammunition, drones and air transport, as well as cyber systems, artificial intelligence and electronic warfare.",
      "The three-year war in Ukraine was also top of the agenda, but no obvious short-term solutions were found to keep the country in the fight, after the U.S. halted military support and intelligence sharing. No new weapons were pledged, no ready cash identified.",
      "Hungary also vetoed a joint statement on support to Ukraine, notably the stance of the 26 other member countries that their war-ravaged partner can only achieve \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d",
      "All 27 leaders agreed that the EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, should loosen budget restrictions so countries that are willing can increase their military spending. The commission monitors whether members are keeping their debt under control.",
      "It estimates that around 650 billion euros ($702 billion) could be freed up that way, and could allow each country to spend at least 3% of their gross domestic product on defense. NATO\u2019s current guideline is that allies should spend at least 2%.",
      "Seven EU countries fall short of that figure, including heavyweights Italy and Spain.",
      "It remains to be seen whether countries that pledged to hit 2% more than a decade ago and still haven\u2019t are now willing, or even able, to dig deeper into their pockets.",
      "The commission also tabled a proposal for an offer of loans worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion) to buy new military equipment, with material priorities to be based on lessons learned from the battlefield in Ukraine. Air and missile defenses are right up there.",
      "The European Commission said it would raise the money on financial markets, and that around 20 member countries would benefit from the more favorable rates that it could generate.",
      "But the leaders did not welcome the idea with open arms. Instead, they invited EU headquarters staff \u201cto examine this proposal as a matter of urgency.\u201d",

      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in Europe, refused to endorse part of the summit statement in favor of Ukraine.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time that Orb\u00e1n has tried to block proceedings, nor the first time that Hungary\u2019s EU partners have moved forward without it.",
      "\u201cHungary is isolated among the 27, and we respect Hungary\u2019s position,\u201d European Council President Antonio Costa told reporters after the meeting. \u201cBut it\u2019s one out of 27, and 26 are more than one.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n appears to relish his isolationist role and is intent on turning the tables.",
      "\u201cThe European Union has isolated itself from the United States now, isolated itself from China because of the trade war, and isolated itself from Russia because of the sanction policy. So if somebody is isolated here it is the European Union,\u201d he said.",
      "Hungary\u2019s population totals around 9.5 million, a fraction of the EU\u2019s 450 million people.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dined with the leaders. He welcomed their security plans and expressed hope that some new spending could strengthen Ukraine\u2019s defense industry.",

      "But the EU offered no new weapons, a day after Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown was bombed again, even though the leaders might argue that this was not the main goal of their summit.",
      "No discussion was held on whether to unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized if Europe was willing.",

      "At its last meeting, the bank said rates were still in \u201crestrictive\u201d territory, indicating further cuts were ahead. After Thursday, the bank's next step is less clear, said Carsten Brzeski, chief of global macro at ING bank.",
      "\u201cWith the increased uncertainty and the prospects of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB\u2019s direction of travel after today\u2019s rate cut is no longer as clear as it was a few weeks ago,\u201d Brzeski said. \u201cA pause at the next meeting to come to terms with the new macro reality now looks like a possibility.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile new concerns that would massively reshuffle the economic picture are likely to intrude: the potential impact of new tariffs on European imports from U.S. President Trump, which could slow growth, and plans for massive new defense spending and borrowing, which could mean more growth but also more inflation.",
      "Those two forces could push the ECB in opposite directions: a hit to growth would call for lower rates in months ahead, while more persistent inflation would argue for keeping rates higher in coming months.",
      "Growth estimates for Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, shot up overnight and long-term interest rates rose in response to an agreement by the two parties that will form the country\u2019s next government to loosen constitutional limits on borrowing and exempt defense spending.",
      "That is a major turnaround in German budget policy and opens the way for a trillion or more in new borrowing and spending over the next decade.",
      "Also in the mix are concerns that Trump will impose new tariffs on European goods, hurting growth in an export-dependent economy.",
      "The 20 countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB determines interest rate policy stagnated in the last three months of the year, showing zero growth. Consumers burned by an earlier outbreak of inflation remain cautious, while businesses have been unsettled by concerns about what Trump may do.",
      "Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, predicted the ECB would stay flexible and decide based on incoming data: \u201cThe possible push, in terms of GDP growth, from higher government spending may be offset by the pull coming from US tariffs and the net effect is unclear.\u201d"

The TSA union called it on \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d and vowed to fight it.",
      "The department, in a statement announcing the termination, criticized the union whose staffers are responsible for keeping weapons off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department said that poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \u201cto safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from a top Democrat in Congress and the union.",
      "\u201cThis action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized workforces across the nation\u2019s transportation networks,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cTSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\u201d",

The federation and the TSA's then-administrator, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement in May of last year. It came amid a push by Homeland Security to improve the pay for the frontline workers, whose pay has historically lagged behind that of other government employees. Pekoske has credited the pay increases, which went into effect in 2023, as helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",

It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers. AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\u201cOur union has been out in front challenging this administration\u2019s unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \u201cNow our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\u201d",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers\u2019 collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cvision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\u201d Stahl wrote. \u201cThis determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\u201d",
      "Stahl said the agency \u201cwill establish alternative procedures\u201d to address employee concerns and grievances \u201cin a fair and transparent manner.\u201d",
      "The end of the collective bargaining agreement was immediately slammed by the top Democrat on the Homeland Security committee in Congress, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who praised the work of TSA staffers in protecting air travel.",
      "\u201cAttempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSince the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA\u2019s attrition rates have plummeted.\u201d",
      "Thompson also criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \u201cflat out wrong anti-union talking points.\u201d He said the real aim was \u201cdiminishing\u201d the workforce so \u201cthey can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump talks of big change in his second term of office. But he's not forgetting small change, either.",
      "Trump ordered the Treasury Department to stop making pennies with a Feb. 10 sentence on his social media account that followed years of conservatives pointing out that putting a copper-coated zinc disc in your pocket costs the government more than a cent \u2014 almost 4 cents today.",
      "Will Trump's order make the penny disappear? There is no sign that the U.S. Mint will stop pressing pennies in Denver and Philadelphia, and Mint officials did not respond to requests for clarification this week.",
      "But the presidential penny pledge is already being felt in one niche world. It's a little-known world that depends on buying pennies wholesale, loading them into machines and persuading parents to feed a few dollars into machines that stamp designs on the pennies \u2014 Paw Patrol, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles \u2014 as they are stretched between metal rollers at funfairs.",
      "Small orbits of collectors and craftsmen have developed around them. And without the penny, the whole thing faces an uncertain future.",
      "New copper pennies vanished from circulation in 1982 \u2014 73 years after the first Lincoln penny was minted \u2014 and were replaced by zinc-coated ones. The old ones are more pliable and easier to stamp, making them hot items for kids at funfairs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll clean \u2019em so when they elongate the dino or shark of the printed coin it maintains a ghost image of the printed head of Lincoln,\u201d said Brian Peters, general manager of Minnesota-based Penny Press Machine Co. \u201cPre-1982 copper pennies, they bring those.\u201d",
      "Jeweler Angelo Rosato worked for decades in the 1960s and '70s hand-printing pennies with scenes of their New Milford, Connecticut, hometown and historical and sentimental scenes. Everything was obsessively cataloged, including more than 4,000 penny photographs.",

      "\u201cI like the pennies,\u201d his 9-year-old son Mason said.",
      "Critics say the rise of electronic commerce and the billions of pennies in circulation mean the U.S. could stop printing the copper coins tomorrow and see little widespread effect for decades. But some people are watching fearfully to see if Trump\u2019s public critique of the penny will affect their business.",
      "Alan Fleming, of Scotland, is the owner of Penny Press Factory, one of a number around the world that manufacture machines that flatten and stamp coins.",
      "\u201cA lovely retired gentleman in Boston sold me over 100,000 uncirculated cents a couple of years ago but he doesn\u2019t have any more,\u201d Fleming wrote. \u201cI will need to purchase new uncirculated cents within the next 12 months to keep my machines supplied and working!\u201d",
      "Regardless of what happens to niche businesses like Fleming's, penny defenders say they\u2019re an important tool for lubricating the economy even if they\u2019re a money-losing proposition.",
      "Since the invention of money, humankind has wrangled with the question of small change, how to denominate amounts so small that the metal coin itself is actually worth more.",
      "In 2003, Thomas J. Sargent and another economist wrote \u201cThe Big Problem of Small Change,\u201d billed as \u201cthe first credible and analytically sound explanation\u201d of why governments had a hard time maintaining a steady supply of small change because of the high costs of production.",
      "In a digital world with the line blurring between the real and the virtual, tactile coins have been reassuring.",
      "\u201cWhat this all tells you about the United States as a country is that it\u2019s an incredibly conservative country when it comes to money,\u201d said Ute Wartenberg, executive director of the American Numismatic Society.",
      "Pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters are sometimes designed by artists laser-sculpting tiny portraits of leaders and landmarks using special software.",

      "Along with fulminating against the United States, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi reasserted China\u2019s South China Sea claims, blasted Japan for its past aggression and covered a wide range of other issues during his annual meeting with journalists",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Along with fulminating against the United States, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi reasserted China\u2019s South China Sea claims, blasted Japan for its past aggression and covered a wide range of other issues during his annual meeting with the press. Here are some of the key topics covered during his Friday press conference.",
      "China has clashed frequently with the Philippines over ownership of and access to islands in the South China Sea, whose rich fishing grounds China claims virtually in its entirety. However, Wang was quick to place blame elsewhere, saying Manila was being manipulated by forces \u201coutside the region,\u201d its standard term for the U.S.",
      "Wang called the entire conflict a \u201cshadow play,\u201d saying an unidentified regional official had used the term at a recent meeting, and said each incident was a \u201cline of script\u201d disseminated by the foreign media with the goal of \u201csmearing China.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina will continue to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with the law. When managing Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal, we will also reflect our humanitarian spirit according to actual needs. But I want to make it clear here that infringement and provocation will inevitably bear its own fruit, and those who are willing to be chess pieces will eventually be discarded.\u201d",
      "Wang also said that Chinese cooperation with its neighbors had eliminated many of the compounds where Chinese nationals, many of them coerced or lured by false promises of legitimate jobs, are forced to contact people in China in a bid to extract money from them through false claims of debts owed or other illegal means.",
      "\u201cAll the cyber fraud parks in northern Myanmar near the border have been cleared. China, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos are working together to crack down on cyber fraud in the Thai-Myanmar border area. Our mission is to cut off the evil hands reaching out to the people and eradicate the cancer of online cyber fraud,\u201d Wang said.",
      "Such operations, usually linked to organized crime, are notoriously quick to resume operations elsewhere. China has been battling the issue for years as the gangs grown increasingly sophisticated in their access to victims' private information. Hundreds of citizens from other countries have also been caught up in such fraudulent schemes targeting victims as far away as the United States.",
      "Wang referred to the upcoming 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, saying \u201cthere are still some people in Japan who have not reflected on their mistakes.\u201d China's education and propaganda systems keep alive memories of Japan's brutal invasion and occupation of much of China before and during the war and anti-Japanese consumer boycotts and other protests pop-up over perceived slights.",
      "Wang also linked the issue to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that was a Japanese colony until the end of the war and which maintains close ties to Japan to this day. China claims the island as its own territory and has threatened to take control by force if necessary. Wang said \u201cit is better to remember that if Taiwan causes trouble, it is to cause trouble for Japan.\u201d",
      "China also claims uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are controlled by Japan, and regularly sends ships and planes into areas surrounding them, much as it does with Taiwan. That prompts Japan to scramble jets to defend what it says are islands legitimately absorbed before World War II because no other nation had a legal claim to them. That too has proved a source of tension in the region and a space where China can challenge the authority of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "Wand touted China as \u201cthe center of stability in Asia, an engine of economic development and a support for regional security,\u201d while blasting the U.S. for basing intermediate-range missiles around China and having \u201cdone nothing but stir up trouble and create divisions.\u201d China advocates \u201copen regionalism and share Asia\u2019s development opportunities on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win results.\u201d",
      "Wang said \u201cif every country stresses my country first and is obsessed with a position of strength, the law of the jungle would reign (across) the world again.\u201d While China has been the subject of suspicion and concern from the Indian Ocean to northern Japan, the South Pacific has lately emerged as a major area of competition between China on one side and the U.S., Australia and New Zealand on the other.",
      "China\u2019s secret security agreements and promises of infrastructure have prompted the three to tighten relations in recognition of the islands\u2019 strategic geographic location after years of what some have described as neglect. However, a U.S. cutoff in aid, along with generous Chinese incentives, could further push them into Beijing\u2019s arms. Three of these \u2014 Tuvalu, Palau and the Marshall Islands are also among Taiwan\u2019s handful of formal diplomatic allies.",

      "Every year, bills are introduced in state legislatures across the country seeking to end the changing of clocks twice a year",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Looking forward to more evening sunlight thanks to daylight saving time this weekend?",
      "Many in the golf industry like the time change, too, and they are pushing to make that annual switch permanent.",
      "The move is intended to encourage more evening golf and to stave off efforts to establish permanent standard time, which would leave less time for an evening on the links. And it is those late afternoon players who tend to buy food and drinks in the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cWe would lose 100 tee times a day if daylight saving time goes away,\u201d said Connor Farrell, general manager of Stone Creek Golf Course in Omaha, Nebraska. \u201cSwitching to permanent standard time would cost us $500,000 a year.\"",
      "Golf has deep roots in the history of daylight saving time, which begins for most states at 2 a.m. Sunday when clocks \u201cspring forward\u201d by one hour. Some credit goes to William Willett, a British builder and avid golfer who in 1905 published a pamphlet advocating for moving clocks ahead in April and returning them back to their regular settings in September. The U.S. adopted a version of that during World War I and again in World War II.",
      "Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966 that set up the biannual time change, and lobbying efforts by the golf industry are largely credited for Congress expanding daylight saving time by a month in the mid-1980s.",
      "But for as long as it has been around, the constant clock adjusting has drawn the ire of Americans weary of losing an hour of sleep in the spring only to be faced with the early onset of darkness in the fall. That exhaustion has led to hundreds of bills introduced in nearly every state over the years to halt the practice.",
      "The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that in the last six years, 20 states have passed measures calling for a switch to year-round daylight saving time, many at the cajoling of golf industry lobbyists. But while states could switch to permanent standard time \u2014 as Arizona and Hawaii have done \u2014 Congress would need to change the law to allow permanent daylight saving time.",
      "That hindrance \u2014 along with arguments that permanent standard time would improve sleep quality and foster safer morning commutes \u2014 has seen more states consider opting out of daylight saving time. Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced bills this year to make standard time permanent.",
      "Nebraska is among several states considering competing bills to make either standard time or daylight saving time permanent. That drew Joe Kohout, a lobbyist for the Nebraska Golf Alliance, to testify in favor of year-round daylight saving time.",
      "Late afternoon golf leagues account for up to 40% of the annual revenue of some Nebraska courses, Kohout said, while a majority of golf instructors reported that nearly 50% of their lessons are taught after 4 p.m.",
      "Under permanent standard time, \u201cNebraska\u2019s golf courses will lose revenue, be forced to raise prices, and in some cases could be driven out of business,\u201d he said.",
      "The Utah Golf Association is also fighting a bill to make standard time permanent.",
      "\u201cThe argument that changing clocks twice a year is an inconvenience does not outweigh the year-round benefits of having more usable daylight hours in the evenings,\u201d it posted on social media.",
      "In Indiana, golf course owner Linda Rogers succeeded in lobbying the Legislature to institute daylight saving time in 2006. Now a state senator, Rogers is fighting an effort to return to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cDaylight savings time allows someone that, you know, worked until 5 o\u2019clock to come out and still play at least nine holes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just golf. There are so many outdoor activities that people want to be outside for and enjoy later in the summertime.\u201d",
      "The National Golf Course Owners Association, which has about 4,000 members, recently polled stakeholders on the matter. The vast majority favored either permanent daylight saving time or the status quo of changing the clocks, said CEO Jay Karen. Only about 6% backed a change to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cIf standard time was to be made permanent, thousands of courses would be harmed by that,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Even so, Karen's group is not advocating for a change to permanent daylight saving because it could hurt hundreds of courses that cater to early morning golfers, he said. Those include courses in retirement communities, vacation resorts where late tee times interfere with dinner plans and Sun Belt courses where extreme late-day heat sees golfers favoring early tee times.",
      "\u201cWe feel like status quo is no harm, no foul,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Republican Iowa state Rep. John Wills introduced a bill this year to make the change to permanent daylight savings. But he has been under pressure to amend the bill to permanent standard time.",
      "Wills was considering it until he heard arguments on how that change could affect golf.",
      "\u2019\u201cI think I might push back in the future and say, you know, the golf industry needs this,\u201d he said."

      "France decisively took over the lead of the championship with a bonus-point victory and can clinch its first title since 2022 in the final round at home next Saturday when it hosts Scotland.",
      "Meanwhile, Ireland's Grand Slam hopes were destroyed in the fourth round for a second straight year, and its hopes of a third successive outright title, unprecedented in the tournament's 142-year history, were probably sunk.",
      "England was also in the title picture, barring an upset at home against Italy on Sunday, but France's other big advantage was an extremely healthy points differential of +106, which is 93 points better than Ireland.",
      "The breadth of France's win by five tries to three, running up its highest score in Ireland, was even more impressive in the absence for the last 50 minutes of talismanic captain Antoine Dupont. He limped off with help because of a right knee injury. When he left, France was leading 5-0 but the momentum was swung.",
      "France was on the ropes for the first 15 minutes, absorbing waves of Irish attacks. But when lock Joe McCarthy was sin-binned for a cynical foul, Dupont set up wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey for the first of his two tries against the run of play.",
      "Ireland, trailing by two at halftime, led 13-8 soon after, but for only four minutes.",
      "Flanker Paul Boudehent crashed over after offloads by prop Jean-Baptiste Gros and Maxime Lucu, Dupont's replacement.",
      "In a double blow to Ireland, winger Calvin Nash was yellow-carded for a high tackle and France pulled away from there thanks to unleashing the seven reserves forwards off the bench.",
      "Ireland couldn't withstand the injection of fresh power.",
      "A France counter-ruck in its own half led to Damian Penaud freeing his fellow wing Bielle-Biarrey, who grubbered ahead and beat Lucu to ground the ball. The try was Bielle-Biarrey's tournament-leading seventh, and 17th in 18 tests.",
      "Replacement lock Oscar Jegou scored his first test try and, while Gros was in the sin-bin, Thomas Ramos intercepted Ireland's Sam Prendergast 10 meters out from his own try-line and let Penaud finish between the posts for his 38th test try, tying the France record of Serge Blanco.",
      "Ramos, as ever, was unerring by nailing his last seven goalkicks.",
      "With victory long secure at 42-13, France took its foot off the pedal, and Ireland scored the last two tries, one of them to caps record-holder Cian Healy, who was playing his last test at home along with Conor Murray and Peter O'Mahony.",
      "Ireland was dealt a major blow moments before kickoff when wing James Lowe suffered a back spasm in the warmup and had to withdraw.",
      "But the way Ireland started suggested France was in for a long afternoon. The Irish camped in the French 22 but breached an equally fierce defense only once, and captain Caelan Doris was held up over the line by opposite Gregory Alldritt.",
      "After McCarthy's yellow card, his heft was missed when France mauled a lineout infield, shortened the defense and Bielle-Biarrey scored in a seventh straight test, eclipsing Penaud's France record.",
      "Dupont then exited, exposing France's risk of a 7-1 bench with only one back reserve. But the gamble paid off handsomely. Lucu was outstanding and the \u201cbomb squad,\u201d notably Emmanuel Meafou and Julien Marchand, overpowered a tiring Ireland in the third quarter.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander is no longer working after landing sideways in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and its mission is over, officials said Friday.",
      "The news came less than 24 hours after the botched landing attempt by Texas-based Intuitive Machines.",

      "It managed to send back pictures confirming its position and activate a few experiments before going silent. NASA and other customers had packed the lander with an ice drill, drone and pair of rovers.",
      "It's unlikely Athena's batteries can be recharged given the way the lander's solar panels are pointed and the extreme cold in the crater.",
      "\u201cThe mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "This was the second landing attempt for Intuitive Machines. The first, a year ago, also ended with a sideways landing, but the company was able to keep it going for longer than this time despite hampered communications and operations.",

      "The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City, rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday.",
      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",
      "And the first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance in the United States found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.",
      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",
      "In December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that monarch butterflies receive protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.",

      "Originally started as a secret project within Google, Waymo has been making major inroads since its robotaxis first began charging for rides in Phoenix nearly five years ago. Waymo's robotaxis are now averaging 200,000 paid rides per week, up from about 10,000 weekly rides two years ago, according to a recent post by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who runs the Mountain View, California, company that owns Google as well as Waymo.",
      "After expanding into Austin and Atlanta this year as part of the Uber partnership, Waymo also plans to begin offering rides in Miami next year through its own app, mirroring how it already runs its service in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "Waymo, so far, has avoided a major traffic accident or other safety problems that might give regulators second thoughts about allowing its robotaxis to remain on the road.",
      "Automaker General Motors tried to compete against Waymo in San Francisco with a robotaxi service operated by its Cruise subsidiary, but had its California license suspended in October 2023 after one of its self-driving cars dragged an injured pedestrian about 20 feet before coming to a stop.",
      "Uber also struck a deal last year to eventually deploy Cruise's robotaxis in cities that were never identified before General Motors pulled the plug on its fleet of self-driving cars.",

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "The lobster industry, based largely in Maine, is one of the most lucrative fisheries in the U.S., valued at more than half a billion dollars at the docks last year.

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017.

But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling.

      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "Extinction is still forever",
      "WASHINGTON -- Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts \u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of how we monetize our business,\u201d said Lamm.",

      "They\u2019ll be joined on their SpaceX ride home by two astronauts who launched by themselves in September alongside two empty seats.",
      "During a news conference Tuesday, Wilmore said that while politics is part of life, it did not play into his and Williams' return, moved up a couple weeks thanks to a change in SpaceX capsules. President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",
      "Williams said she can't wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just Butch and Suni,\" Williams said. \u201cEverybody knows who we are by now.\"",

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",
      "\"Apparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\" Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d",

      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",

      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim.

      "The Human Rights Campaign accused Newsom of trying to \"score political points.\"",
      "In this first episode of a new podcast published Thursday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is \"deeply unfair.\"",
      "\"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said on his podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's comments came during a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who leads conservative group Turning Point USA and played a critical role in garnering youth support for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. Trump's campaign had played back her remarks in a widely-circulated ad.",
      "\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom also pointed to his own work in expanding LGBTQ rights, while referencing current law in the state of California that allows transgender athletes to participate in school sports that reflect the gender they identify with.",
      "Newsom himself was a trailblazer in expanding LGBTQ rights: in 2004, as mayor of San Francisco, he allowed same-sex marriages to proceed even though they were not yet allowed nationwide.",
      "He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "\"I've been a leader in the LGBTQ places, as, you know, back in 2004 [I] was marrying same sex couples. And I know we have [a] difference [of] opinion on marriage equality, and so I've been at this for years and years, I take a backseat to no one,\" Newsom said, before discussing how he heard people talking about transgender athletes.",
      "On the podcast, Newsom also called for compassion toward transgender individuals, even while discussing the sports issue: \"There's also humility and grace. You know, that, these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\"",
      "LGBTQ rights groups criticized Newsom's remarks, saying that they came amid national backlash to transgender individuals and their rights.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign, a major national LGBTQ rights advocacy and lobbying group, said in a statement shared on social media that with discussions nationwide in legislatures about restricting same-sex marriage or transgender rights, \"this is not a moment to sit politely in the face of authoritarian bullies or throw people under the bus for political posturing.\"",
      "\"Singling out trans kids to score political points is never going to help someone pay their rent, keep Medicaid or get a job, but it will make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs,\" the organization wrote. \"Californians - and ALL Americans - need leaders who have courage in their convictions, and who will show up for them, in the faces of people who want to see us all back in the closet.\"",
      "The organization also pointed to a 2013 law in California that allowed students to be part of sport teams matching their own gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the law in 2013 as \"ensuring transgender youth have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in schools across the state.\"",
      "Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor.",
      "Two members of the California state legislature, Assemblymember Chris Ward and state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, released a statement through the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus criticizing Newsom's remarks as well, saying they were \"profoundly sickened and frustrated\" by what he said.",
      "\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,\" they wrote. \"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one's gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.\"",
      "Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. The White House has said the action is meant to protect women in sports from harm and from facing opponents who they say have an unfair advantage.",
      "LGBTQ advocacy groups have criticized the administration's action and general rhetoric as discriminatory and as having razor-sharp focus on issues of transgender rights to the exclusion of economic and other issues.",

      "Over the coming week, federal judges have ordered key Trump administration officials to testify about mass firings and the dismantling of key agencies, while DOGE representatives will likely have to turn over evidence in dozens of cases and participate in a sworn deposition for at least one case.",
      "The legal challenges materializing against DOGE could present an existential challenge for the group, whose effectiveness has in part stemmed from its ability to move quickly and make massive changes without the normal oversight.",
      "While Musk and Trump have touted DOGE's transparency -- including on DOGE's website, where it lists recently canceled contracts -- the plaintiffs challenging the group have argued that the group has relied on secrecy to hide tactics that violate federal law.",
      "\"[T]he entity has worked in the shadows -- a cadre of largely unidentified actors, whose status as government employees is unclear, controlling major government functions with no oversight,\" one lawsuit alleged.",
      "That secrecy has also made it harder for nonprofits or federal unions to successfully block DOGE in court, with many plaintiffs relying on media reporting -- rather than documentary evidence -- to prove the harms DOGE has allegedly caused.",
      "\"The court can't act based on the media reports. We can't do that,\" one federal judge said in a case about the constitutionality of Musk's power. \"The things that I'm hearing are concerning indeed and troubling indeed, but I have to have a record, and I have to make a finding the facts before I issue something.\"",
      "But that might begin to change as the cases against DOGE progress and plaintiffs are entitled to receive discovery -- i.e., the exchange of evidence -- relevant to key allegations. At least one federal judge has ordered a DOGE representative to sit for a sworn deposition about the group's access to the federal government's sensitive data.",
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C, was scheduled Friday afternoon to consider what kind of regulations will govern the transparency behind DOGE after the group argued it shouldn't be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and next week might provide some of the first sworn testimony about Trump's effort to rapidly reduce the size of government since retaking office.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Washington is holding a hearing at which the acting chief operating officer of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been ordered to testify about the ongoing dismantling of the agency, and a separate judge in California on Thursday is requiring the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management to testify under oath about how the Trump administration allegedly ordered the mass firing of probationary employees.",
      "\"We will prove in this case that remarkably, and I do not say this lightly, your honor, Acting Director [Charles] Ezell is not telling the truth to this court,\" a lawyer challenging the mass firings alleged, prompting the judge overseeing the case to order Ezell to testify in person.",
      "\"We're going to have Ezell come out here and he's going to be under oath right up there and these lawyers are going to quiz him,\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup said.",
      "During a court hearing on Thursday about Ezell's testimony, lawyers with the Department of Justice said the administration is considering making Ezell unavailable for testimony despite the court's order, citing logistical concerns and their potential appeal of the decision. Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the move a clear defiance of a court order and a delay tactic.",
      "\"No final decision had been made,\" a DOJ lawyer told Judge Alsup, suggesting the final decision would be made in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has already begun its appeal in more than a dozen cases challenging Trump's executive actions, and two adverse rulings have already reached the Supreme Court.",

      "According to copies of some of the termination letters, viewed by ABC News, canceled grants involved research around \"transgender issues\" and \"gender identity,\" including studying stress in older LGBTQ+ adults and the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia in LGBTQ+ older adults.",
      "\"This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,\" all of the letters read. \"Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\"",

      "The letters state that typically NIH allows grant recipients to \"take appropriate corrective action\" before a termination decision is allowed. However, the letters declare \"No corrective action is possible here.\"",
      "It comes as President Donald Trump has made sweeping changes to the federal government in his first few weeks in office, including issuing new guidance that only recognizes two sexes, vowing to \"defend women from gender ideology extremism\" and issuing several executive orders aiming to dismantle DEI initiatives.",

      "Category two involves projects \"partially\" supporting DEI activities. The award can only be granted if the \"non-compliant\" activities are negotiated out of the project.",
      "Category three involves projects that do not support DEI activities but may contain DEI-related language, which must be removed before an award can be issued, and category four involves projects that do not support any DEI activities.",
      "It's unclear what it exactly means for a project to support DEI activities or contain DEI language, but the guidance document includes examples such as the purpose of a meeting being diversity or \"a statement regarding institutional commitment to diversity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jerome Powell issued remarks as Trump threatened new tariffs on Canada.",
      "As President Donald Trump on Friday threatened new tariffs on Canadian products, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the  administration's tariff plan would likely raise prices for U.S. shoppers and retailers.",
      "The scale and duration of the tariffs remain unclear but a portion of the taxes on imports will probably reach consumers, Powell told an economic forum in New York City on Friday.",
      "\"We're at a stage where we're still very uncertain about what will be tariffed, for how long, at what level,\" Powell said. \"But the likelihood is some of that will find its way. It will hit the exporters, the importers, the retailers and to some extent consumers.\"",
      "The Trump administration slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.",
      "Tariffs of this magnitude are widely expected to increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.",
      "\"Everybody is forecasting some inflation effect from tariffs,\" Powell said on Friday.",
      "The remarks from Powell at the annual U.S. Monetary Policy Forum marked a notable prediction from the nation's top central banker charged with keeping inflation under control.",
      "While acknowledging the likelihood of price hikes, however, Powell said the Fed's response would depend on what exactly transpires.",
      "A potentially temporary bump in prices may not warrant intervention, while a more sustained increase could require action, Powell said, noting that the strength of the economy affords the Fed time to assess the impact.",
      "\"In some cases, where we think it's a one-time thing, the textbook would be to look through it,\" Powell said. \"If it turns into a series of things and it's more than that -- [and] if the increases are larger -- that would matter.\"",
      "Powell spoke hours after Trump on Truth Social threatened to slap tariffs, sanctions and other measures on Russia in response to conduct in the war with Ukraine.",
      "The tariffs may become necessary \"based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now,\" Trump said.",
      "Later on Friday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he may also impose new tariffs on Canada, including a tariff on lumber and a 250% duty on dairy products.",
      "Trump indicated the U.S. could take reciprocal action against Canada's roughly 250% tariff on dairy as soon as Friday.",
      "\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250% nobody ever talks about that 250% tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore,\" Trump said.",
      "The potential moves could expand Trump's confrontational trade policy beyond a set of tariffs put forward this week.",
      "The tariff policy could cause \"some disturbance\" for the U.S., Trump noted in his remarks at the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has eased some of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico in recent days.",
      "Trump issued a one-month delay for tariffs on auto-related goods from Mexico and Canada. The carve-out expanded soon afterward with an additional one-month pause for goods from Mexico and Canada compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement.",
      "In addition to tariffs, Powell mentioned other economic proposals pursued by the Trump administration, including measures affecting fiscal policy and regulation.",
      "\"The new administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes,\" Powell said. \"Uncertainty around these changes and their likely effects remains high. We are focused on parsing the signal from the noise as the situation evolves. We are not in a hurry.\"",

      "Congress has one week to pass a spending bill that would avert a government shutdown, but lawmakers from both parties are not on the same page about how they'll move forward.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he aims to hold a vote on Tuesday in the House on a clean short-term bill that would fund the government at current levels through the end of September 2025, but the details of the proposal remain unclear.",
      "Leaders said they are hoping to release the legislative text as soon as Friday, but that will likely slide into the weekend.",
      "\"I believe we'll pass it along party lines,\" Johnson told reporters on Thursday. \"But I think every Democrat should vote for this [continuing resolution]. It is a fundamental responsibility we have to fund the government, and a clean CR with a few minor anomalies is not something they should vote against, so we'll see what they do.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has lobbied House Republicans to support the measure, including hard-liners who typically vote against continuing resolutions.",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill, because it sets us up to cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation, all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "Johnson can only afford to lose one defection if all members are voting and present, meaning he'll almost certainly need the help of Democrats to pass the measure.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, have said they will vote no on a continuing resolution -- presenting a challenge for Johnson, who is navigating a tight House majority.",
      "Top House Democratic leaders explicitly said Friday in a letter to colleagues that they will oppose Johnson's funding bill, arguing it could lead to cuts down the road to programs such as Medicaid.",
      "\"Republicans have decided to introduce a partisan continuing resolution that threatens to cut funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year. That is not acceptable,\" they wrote.",
      "\"We cannot back a measure that rips away life-sustaining healthcare and retirement benefits from everyday Americans as part of the Republican scheme to pay for massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors like Elon Musk,\" they added. \"Medicaid is our redline.\"",
      "Any funding bill will also need to clear the Senate, where Democratic support will be critical. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has already vowed to vote against the legislation, which means at least eight Democrats will be needed for any funding proposal to pass.",
      "Democrats have so far kept their cards close as to what they'll do if presented with such a bill. Many Senate Democrats say a six-month continuing resolution, like the one Johnson is proposing, would be a \"disaster,\" but they've also expressed little interest in shutting down the government.",
      "Some Democrats prefer a plan that would see the passage of a shorter stopgap measure to allow completion of work on full-year appropriations bills.",
      "But if Johnson passes his plan and the House flees Washington, there may be few alternative options remaining that don't trigger at least a brief government shutdown.",
      "Government funding is one of the few areas in which Democrats, who have been pushing for ways to challenge Elon Musk's cuts via the Department of Government Efficiency, can assert their leverage. Whether or not they'll ultimately use this bill to make that stand, and risk shutting the government down, remains to be seen."

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 16:57:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Crypto czar David Sacks argued taxpayers have lost out on billions because earlier administrations never took advantage of bitcoin in the government's possession.",
    "story": [
      "Trump is holding a digital assets summit on cryptocurrency on Friday.",
      "David Sacks, the White House crypto czar, said Friday that taxpayers have lost out on \"over $17 billion of value\" because earlier administrations never took advantage of bitcoin already in the U.S. government's possession.",
      "\"Over the past decade or so, the federal government has come into the possession of roughly 400,000 bitcoin through civil or criminal asset forfeitures,\" Sacks said in an interview with ABC News\u2019 Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang on Friday. \"We've had this very ad hoc strategy where we just would sell the bitcoin, sort of almost willy-nilly, and we sold about half of it. We only made about $400 million. Today, that bitcoin would have been worth over $17 billion, so the American taxpayer lost out on over $17 billion of value.\"",
      "Sacks' comments follow President Donald Trump signing an executive order on Thursday that creates a strategic bitcoin reserve and U.S. digital assets stockpile. Senior White House officials said bitcoin is being treated differently from other cryptocurrencies because it is the \"original\" cryptocurrency and there is a finite amount.",
      "Sacks brushed off repeated questions about whether this could pose a conflict of interest since President Donald Trump has a personal financial stake in the success of the industry after launching his own cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial, days before the inauguration.",
      "\"It's not an issue,\" Sacks told Wang.",
      "When asked about Bloomberg News' reporting that World Liberty Financial appears to have bought more than $20 million in cryptocurrency two days before the White House's Digital Assets Summit on Friday, Sacks said: \"You should talk to them about that. That's a private company. I'm not a regulator. I'm a policy adviser for innovation. I don't keep tabs on what individual companies are doing.\"",
      "Sacks stressed that the government is not buying any cryptocurrency, just using the cryptocurrency that has already been accumulated through criminal or civil asset forfeitures.",
      "\"Any further accumulation of bitcoin by the government has to be done in a completely budget-neutral way. It cannot add to the deficit, it cannot add to the debt, it cannot tax the American people,\" Sacks said. \"So this is about maximizing the value of assets that we already have on our balance sheet.\"",
      "When asked by ABC News how the government could \"accumulate\" more bitcoin in a budget-neutral way, Sacks said those programs don't exist, noting the administration is still in the planning phase and that the executive order calls on the secretaries of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Treasury to \"think about that.\"",
      "\"It won't cost the taxpayer dimes, but if the secretaries can figure out how to accumulate more bitcoin without costing taxpayers anything, then they are authorized to do that,\" the senior White House officials added.",
      "Sacks repeatedly compared bitcoin to U.S. holdings of gold, explaining that the U.S. won't be selling it, unless Trump changes his mind down the road.",
      "\"We've got about a trillion dollars of gold in Fort Knox and our other depositories,\" he said. \"We don't sell that gold, even though we could use it to pay off a trillion dollars of national debt. The reason why we don't sell it, liquidate it all today is because we believe it's strategic for the United States to have a stockpile or reserve of that asset.",
      "\"In a similar way, we believe it's in the long term interest the United States to hold on to this bitcoin,\" he added. \"Look, if the president changes his mind at some point in the future, he could issue a new executive order and say, the secretary of the treasury, get rid of it, sell it. But we don't want to do that.\"",
      "White House officials also noted that an official audit of the government's digital asset holdings has never been completed but will be following the president's executive order, allowing the administration to get a more concrete understanding of what the U.S. possesses.",

    "story": [
      "\"He certainly intends to sign the order,\" McMahon said of Trump.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said Friday that President Donald Trump \"intends\" to sign an executive order to dissolve the Department of Education -- but it's still unclear when.",
      "\"I don't know. I don't want to get ahead of the president,\" she said on \"Fox & Friends\" Friday, adding \"I think you'd have to check with the White House.\"",
      "Her comments come after the White House on Thursday pulled the expected signing of an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. The White House pulled to order's signing because of concerns of blowback the order would receive -- specifically if vital federal programs could no longer exist, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News.",
      "Without giving any details, McMahon said she had spoken to Trump about the executive order and that he is \"crystal clear\" on the move. As ABC News reported earlier this week, a draft of the order calls on McMahon to facilitate a department closure by taking all necessary steps \"permitted by law,\" sources said.",
      "In the interview, McMahon underscored that abolishing the agency is rooted in allowing families the right to a \"quality education\" through school choice.",
      "She mentioned that kids should not be \"stuck in failing schools,\" and that their parents deserve the right to send them to better schools through various programs and voucher systems.",
      "\"He certainly intends to sign the order,\" McMahon said. \"His intent is to provide quality education through school choice to all students, and he wants to make sure that education is back at the state level where it belongs, that our local school boards, that governors and teachers and parents are really the ones that are involved mostly in their children's education.\"",
      "Education is already a local-level issue. The department conducts federal investigations and research projects; it also oversees programs intended to protect students' civil rights and those with disabilities.",
      "McMahon stressed that the department does not create school curriculum and said the agency she has been tapped to lead is not needed.",
      "\"[The president] couldn't be any more clear when he said he wants me to put myself out of a job,\" she said. \"I think there is definitely a role for education to make sure that as we move education back to the states, that we are providing the tools for the governors, for the teachers, that we can provide them with research to show best practices.\"",
      "However, such moves would require congressional approval; any proposed legislation would likely fail without 60 Senate votes.",
      "Congress rarely came up in the interview with \"Fox & Friends\" anchor Ainsley Earhardt, who mentioned a department closure would take 60 Senate yes votes to shutter the agency Congress started in 1980. During McMahon's confirmation hearing last month, she said she would need Congress to carry out the president's campaign promise and vision.",
      "\"We'd like to do this right,\" she said, adding that the department's closure \"certainly does require congressional action.\"",
      "McMahon allies such as Glenn Jacobs -- the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, who is best known as the World Wrestling Entertainment superstar Kane -- told ABC News that choosing McMahon is helping to bring \"transformational change\" to the federal government.",
      "\"If you put a Washington insider in there, you're getting the same thing,\" Jacobs said. \"We're in the situation where we have $36 trillion in debt and the government doesn't work because we've just been going with the status quo for so long, there has to be some radical transformation.\"",
      "But McMahon's critics are vowing to press forward to preserve the department. In a virtual address with education leaders on Thursday, \u200b\u200bNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said that dismantling the agency will harm millions of students in New York and across the country.",
      "\"What [the Trump administration is] doing is saying our kids don't matter,\" Hochul said. \"What's more important is that we slash, for the sake of slashing, and also be able to fund tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. So instead of supporting a math class, they're supporting tax breaks for the buddies at Mar-a-Lago.\"",
      "With scores of education department employees already on edge -- some on paid leave, taking retirement severance packages or scrambling to do their jobs as a department closure looms -- McMahon said she'd like to help any fired federal workers find new employment.",
      "\"Any time there's talk about shutting a department down, the employees that are there are concerned about their jobs, but there are good off ramps for them,\" McMahon said. \"In a country where we right now have over 8 million openings and jobs, I think there'll be a lot of places for them to go. We'd like to help them get there.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the business executive and former WWE president said she welcomed input from the Department of Government Efficiency tasked with scrubbing the federal government for fraud, waste and abuse. She said she frequently meets with DOGE as they conduct an \"audit\" of the agency.",
      "\"When I was in the private sector, I think a lot of stuff is always turned up when you do a good, solid audit,\" McMahon said. \"I welcome the DOGE folks that are in -- we meet with them almost daily. I've been very appreciative of the things that they have shown us, some of the waste, and we're right where we're reacting to that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amy Gleason, the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, is not a household name",
      "When her daughter was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease in 2010, Amy Gleason attacked the challenge.",
      "She carried binders of medical records to doctors\u2019 appointments across six health systems seeking the best care for juvenile dermatomyositis. She volunteered at a nonprofit searching for a cure. She also started a health care company to create record-sharing software that would make life easier for chronically ill patients and families.",
      "Within five years, President Barack Obama\u2019s White House recognized Gleason as a \u201cChampion of Change\u201d in the industry. When the coronavirus struck in 2020, she was a health care technologist in the first Trump White House who worked grueling hours building data systems to guide the federal response. (And her daughter was a thriving college student.)",
      "Now, her journey has improbably led to President Donald Trump naming her the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, a position that seems to convey extraordinary power. Except almost no one has heard of her and everyone knows the man the president says is actually leading the unparalleled effort to gut the federal workforce and shutter agencies: Elon Musk.",
      "While Musk has claimed his Department of Government Efficiency is fully transparent, until last week the White House press secretary would not even say Gleason's name \u2014 which does not appear on the DOGE website.",
      "In his address to Congress Tuesday, Trump made clear that Musk is in charge, saluting him as the head of DOGE, with Musk smiling down on the president from the visitors' gallery. Yet government lawyers have argued in court that Gleason and not Musk is the agency\u2019s leader.",
      "The confusion has added to the mystery around the role of Gleason, who did not respond to a phone call or text message for comment.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows for sure what her role is and whether she actually has any oversight of any of the people doing the work, or is she just there as a punching bag and a distraction to keep their actual activities shielded from the public,\u201d said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that sued the DOGE Service and Gleason seeking access to records that would shed light on their operations.",
      "DOGE claims credit for saving more than $100 billion through mass firings, cancellations of contracts and grants, office closures and other cuts that have paralyzed entire agencies. Many of those claimed savings have turned out to be overstated or unproven.",
      "On one level, Gleason fits the mold of a Musk employee, one willing to work arduous hours to meet his goals. Former colleagues say she is an effective behind-the-scenes operator and say her rise is the story of a former nurse who got into health care technology to help patients and doctors and climbed through merit.",
      "\u201cFrom my perspective, I can\u2019t imagine somebody I\u2019d rather have there,\u201d said Jamie Grant, a former Republican lawmaker in Florida who worked with Gleason to start a health care company. \u201cSomebody saying yes to that job right now better believe in the mission and better have a spine and be talented and she\u2019s that in spades.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Gleason had served as the acting administrator at DOGE for weeks. But that was not the widely held understanding of her position internally, according to three people with knowledge of the office\u2019s operation who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.",
      "While the exact nature of Gleason\u2019s portfolio was not well defined, what was clear is that she was working closely with DOGE leaders. She attempted to push civil service staffers in the office to hire at least two people who failed screening reviews for prospective hires; both were later hired by DOGE, according to two of the people who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "The uncertainty over her role \u2014 and when she was appointed to it \u2014 could have far-reaching implications in a series of ongoing lawsuits filed to blunt the impact of Musk's radical paring of the government workforce.",
      "Under questioning from U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly recently, government attorneys struggled to explain who was in charge of DOGE or Musk's precise role. That led Kollar-Kotelly to wonder if the office was running afoul of the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause because Musk had not been nominated to lead the office, or received confirmation from the Senate.",
      "The Trump administration announced the following day that Gleason was DOGE's acting administrator, a question they had previously refused to answer.",
      "Unlike many DOGE workers, Gleason has no prior ties to Musk. She recently worked as chief products officer at Nashville-based health care firms founded by Brad Smith, who worked in the prior Trump administration on health care and is also a DOGE adviser.",
      "Smith and Gleason began working on Trump\u2019s transition after the November election, and her role in Trump's orbit has grown. In December, she rejoined the United States Digital Service, where she had previously worked from 2018 through 2021 on high-level government health care technology initiatives.",
      "On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order rebranding USDS as the US DOGE Service and giving it a mandate to help Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative. Soon, dozens of Musk acolytes associated with DOGE began arriving at agencies across the government demanding access to sensitive data systems and pushing for drastic changes.",
      "While 21 others in the office resigned in protest rather than carry out Musk\u2019s initiatives, Gleason accepted a position that thrust her into an unfamiliar spotlight.",
      "Health care entrepreneur Travis Bond, Gleason\u2019s colleague over two decades at companies in Florida, said Gleason will hate the public attention but excel in her new role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure they could have picked a better person. She just thinks, eats and breathes this stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "Bond, Gleason and Grant in 2011 launched CareSync Inc., which developed an app to allow patients suffering from chronic disease to keep their medical records in one place. After benefiting from a $7.25 million grant from one Florida county, CareSync found it hard to attract buyers for subscriptions that cost up to $199 annually.",
      "CareSync pivoted in 2015, taking advantage of a new federal rule that allowed Medicare providers to bill for chronic care management services delivered remotely. The company raised millions of dollars from investors and began rapidly adding staff and serving more than 20,000 patients nationwide. By summer 2018, CareSync ran out of cash and closed without notice, firing 300 workers and leaving creditors owed millions.",
      "Gleason recalled later that she was \u201ctrying to figure out what in the world to do in life\u201d after that experience and applied for the USDS with encouragement from Aneesh Chopra, U.S. chief technology officer under Obama. Chopra declined comment.",
      "She focused on improving technology systems at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the pandemic, she worked under White House response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx to develop laboratory and hospital data reporting systems. Birx praised Gleason last week in an interview with CNN as a \u201creally competent, hardworking, focused woman who understands the value of data.\u201d",
      "Near the end of her three-year stint in 2021, Gleason reflected on her work in a podcast interview, saying the digital service sought to \u201cempower the civil servants and to bring new approaches in technology to the government and to help modernize their efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur mission is really to do the greatest good, for the greatest number of people, in the greatest need,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department is celebrating its decision to drop a federal lawsuit against a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of worsening cancer risks for residents in a majority-Black community",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Friday celebrated its decision to drop a federal lawsuit against a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of worsening cancer risks for residents in a majority-Black community, saying the dismissal showed that officials are \u201cdelivering on President (Donald) Trump\u2019s promise to dismantle radical DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) programs and restore integrity to federal enforcement efforts.\u201d",
      "The dismissal Wednesday of the two-year-old case underscored the Trump administration's commitment to \u201celiminate ideological overreach and restore impartial enforcement of federal laws,'' Justice said in a statement.",
      "At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its formal referral of the case to the Justice Department. The agency said the action aligns with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s pledge to end the use of \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d as an enforcement tool that Zeldin was too often used to advance liberal ideological priorities.",
      "Dismissal of the case unraveled one of former President Joe Biden\u2019s highest-profile targets for an environmental justice effort aimed at improving conditions in places disproportionately harmed by decades of industrial pollution. Biden\u2019s EPA sued the Denka Performance Elastomer plant in early 2023, alleging it posed an unacceptable cancer risk and demanding cuts in toxic emissions of cancer-causing chloroprene.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana and was formally withdrawn Wednesday.",
      "The action is one of a series the Trump administration has taken as it moves quickly to reverse the environmental justice focus of Biden\u2019s administration, placing roughly 170 environmental justice-focused staffers on administrative leave. Dropping the Denka case relieves pressure on a company that has spent years fighting federal lawsuits and investigations over its impact on public health.",
      "Denka, based in Japan, bought the former DuPont plant in LaPlace, Louisiana, a decade ago. It\u2019s located near an elementary school in a community about 30 miles outside New Orleans.",
      "The site produces neoprene, a synthetic rubber that is found in products such as wetsuits and laptop sleeves. The Justice Department sued the company in early 2023, accusing it of emitting unacceptable levels of chloroprene, a chemical that may be especially harmful to children. A judge had scheduled a bench trial for April.",
      "Dismissal of the case reflects the Justice Department's \u201crenewed commitment to enforce environmental laws as Congress intended \u2014 consistently, fairly and without regard to race,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson, who oversees the department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who took over the EPA in late January, said the dismissal was \u201ca step toward ensuring that environmental enforcement is consistent with the law. While EPA\u2019s core mission includes securing clean air for all Americans, we can fulfill that mission within well-established legal frameworks, without stretching the bounds of the law or improperly implementing so-called \u2018environmental justice.'\u201d",
      "Denka said the dismissal was \u201clong-overdue\u201d and ends litigation that it said lacked scientific and legal merit. The lawsuit was a \u201cdraining attack on our business,\" the company said.",
      "\u201cThe focus should be on the real-world data that shows no adverse health effects, even at substantially higher emission levels,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The government\u2019s lawsuit said air monitoring showed that long-term concentrations near the Denka plant are as high as 15 times the amount recommended for long-term exposure to chloroprene.",
      "The EPA under Biden issued a related rule aimed at reducing industrial pollution that gave Denka a fast deadline to lower its emissions. The company said it was being singled out and other manufacturers were given far more time to comply. The company also said the plant has significantly reduced its emissions in recent years, since the sale was completed in 2015. The company won an extension of its deadline.",
      "The Denka plant is located in an industrial stretch of Louisiana from New Orleans to Baton Rouge that is officially called the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor. It\u2019s known informally as Cancer Alley for the high incidence of cancer among residents who live near the industrial corridor, which has about 200 fossil fuel and petrochemical operations. The area accounts for about 25% of the petrochemical production in the United States."

      "\u201cThe NFA is a powerhouse for the fire service,\" said Marc Bashoor, a former West Virginia fire chief with 44 years of fire safety experience. \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018nice to have.\u2019 It is the one avenue we have to bring people from all over the country to learn from and with each other. If we want to continue to have one of the premier fire services in the world, we need to have the National Fire Academy.\u201d",
      "The academy, which also houses the National Fallen Firefighter's Memorial, opened in 1973 to combat a growing number of fatal fires nationwide. At the time, the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control envisioned it to be the \u201cWest Point of the Fire Service,\u201d according to a report form the organization.",

      "\u201cPeople had made their plane and travel reservations. And all of a sudden, they get an email that \u2018Sorry, it\u2019s been canceled,'\" he said. \"It\u2019s really upsetting.\u201d",
      "For firefighters, including those on the frontlines of deadly fires that ravaged California this year, having an essential training institution \u201cshut down under the presumption that there\u2019s waste, fraud and abuse\u201d has been demoralizing, Bashoor said. He said losing NFA training could make the coordinated response that prevented additional deaths and destruction in California more difficult.",
      "FEMA and the National Fire Academy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While surveying disaster zones in California in January, Trump said he was considering \u201cgetting rid of\u201d FEMA altogether, previewing sweeping changes to the nation's central organization of responding to disasters.",
      "Firings at the U.S. Forest Service on the heels of the deadly California blazes also sparked outcry among discharged workers and officials who said it would mean fewer people and less resources will be available to help prevent and fight wildfires."

      "Ever since a hawk hovered over a vigil for her murdered son and lifted her spirits, Georgia mother Michele Davis has found joy in unexpected ways",
      "ROSWELL, Ga. -- A hawk swooped in and landed on a tree, then watched as Michele and Jeremy Davis mourned their murdered son at a vigil outside his high school.",
      "It was one day after their teenager, Carter, was gunned down in a random attack that sent fear through the suburbs north of Atlanta in the summer of 2016.",
      "The hawk stayed as the father spoke. When he finished, it began soaring silently over the crowd, flying just over the heads of Carter's classmates at the tearful vigil, Michele Davis recalled in an interview this week.",
      "Hawks and butterflies would show up later for the Davis family in surprising and unexpected ways. They've been part of a series of events that helped her regain her joy, she said.",
      "Michele Davis is an English teacher at the Lovett School in Atlanta, and one of the latest signs that her son is OK came through a former student, Slater Nalley. He wrote a song about Carter and later made it onto the TV show \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Nalley's performance of \"Traces of You\" will be aired on the season premiere Sunday night, ABC representatives said.",
      "Michele Davis spent one of the last days with her son in her home state of South Dakota, beneath the towering granite peaks in the Black Hills. She and Carter noticed two granite spires touching each other across a ravine, a rock formation known as the Praying Hands.",
      "Three days later, Carter and his friend Natalie Henderson, both 17, were gunned down. It was the night before he was supposed to start his senior year at River Ridge High School in Woodstock, Georgia.",
      "Hours after the killings, Carter's parents gathered with their daughter, 8-year-old Greta, to find a path forward. They'd just heard devastating details of the murders from police detectives. When the police left, they went to their porch and decided to look for messages that signaled Carter was OK, Michele Davis said. To help Greta better comprehend the loss of her big brother, Jeremy Davis explained to his daughter that Carter may send messages that he\u2019s fine in unique ways, such as with feathers or dragonflies.",
      "They talked it over a bit before Jeremy Davis told the family: \u201cI see him as a hawk or an eagle, soaring high above.\"",
      "The next evening at the vigil, the hawk appeared.",
      "As Michele Davis spoke with her parents a couple of days after the killings, a yellow and black butterfly landed near them. It reminded them of Carter's love for butterflies.",
      "Carter was also passionate about sports, and hoped to play lacrosse in college. Weeks after the killings, friends and family organized a pick-up lacrosse game in Georgia.",
      "Carter's best friend from South Dakota flew to Atlanta for the game and wore Carter's helmet and jersey. Midway through, players came to a halt. They began pointing at Carter's helmet, where a yellow butterfly had landed.",
      "Days after the killing, Roswell police arrested Jeffrey Hazelwood on two murder counts. Police said he stalked Carter and Henderson as they spent time in a parked car outside a Publix grocery store.",
      "Hazelwood, who was 20 at the time, had climbed onto the roof of the grocery store during the predawn hours on Aug. 1, 2016, to watch them, prosecutors said. He later confronted the teens in the parking lot, shooting both of them in the head, the medical examiner determined. There was no evidence that he even knew them.",
      "After the killings, Hazelwood wore a \u201cGuy Fawkes\u201d mask \u2014 which gained popularity after the 2006 film \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d \u2014 as he filled his car with gas at a nearby convenience store, surveillance video shows. There's no evidence he was wearing the mask during the killings, as there's no surveillance video that captured the teens being shot, police said. Detectives later found writings by Hazelwood that expressed his desire to become an assassin.",
      "Hazelwood pleaded guilty but mentally ill to two counts of murder, and is serving a life sentence in a Georgia prison, according to the state Department of Corrections. Hazelwood has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, his defense lawyers said in court.",
      "A priest who prayed with her and the Henderson family, and the Roswell police detectives who interviewed Michele and Jeremy Davis also gave them comfort in their darkest days, Michele Davis said.",
      "She's also grateful that detectives secured a confession from Hazelwood. He shook uncontrollably as he recounted the crime to a detective, as seen in the interrogation video. The police department's forensic science laboratory now has a plaque on the wall: \u201cIn Memory of Natalie Henderson & Carter Davis. When the innocent cannot cry out for justice, it is our duty to do so for them.\u201d",
      "Last year, Michele Davis shared a poem she had written with Nalley, her former student. Nalley then created a song about Carter and wanted to bring his guitar to school and play it for the class.",
      "\u201cIt was the most magical thing I had ever heard,\" Michele Davis said. Students in other classrooms heard the music. So \"we went on this classroom tour of him singing this song and me sitting there listening to it and crying,\u201d she said.",
      "The song's opening lyric is \u201cYour laugh was like a river running home.\u201d Later, the song evokes the hawks that bring comfort to her: \u201cSomewhere past the sky I can feel you dancing in the air. Every single time I see a bird fly by, I\u2019m reminded you\u2019re answering my prayers.\u201d",
      "Through a friend, Michele Davis was able to find a small group of women in the Atlanta area known as the Warrior Moms, all of whom have suffered tremendous loss.",
      "\u201cAs Americans we shy away from talking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's just underneath the surface \u2014 this sadness \u2014 that any one second, I can just sit still long enough and break down crying.\u201d",
      "The Warrior Moms plan to share their experiences in a book, \u201cGrieve Like a Mother, Survive Like a Warrior,\u201d set to be released later this year.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to be able to tell our stories that help people find joy again,\u201d Michele Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s very intentional with finding joy.\u201d",
      "Another thing she's learned is what she calls \u201cliving in the \u2018and,\u2019\" as in \u201cdark and light, sorrow and happiness, grief and joy,\" she said.",
      "She also plans to keep looking for those unexpected moments, when the memory of her son comes flooding back.",
      "\u201cYou look for the hawks and butterflies,\" she said."

      "A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines challenges the viability of a proposed project snaking through five Midwest states",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines raises questions about the viability of a proposed 2,500 mile (4,023-kilometer) project snaking through five Midwest states.",
      "Summit Carbon Solutions, the company behind the estimated $8.9 billion pipeline, vowed to keep pursuing the project despite South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden's announcement Thursday that he had signed a bill into law that will make routing the line much more difficult. The law bans Summit from forcing South Dakota landowners to allow the pipeline through their property.",
      "Plans call for the pipeline to carry greenhouse gas emissions from more than 50 ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to a spot in North Dakota, where it would be permanently stored underground.",
      "It's unclear whether Summit will pursue legal action but the company said in a statement that \u201call options are on the table\" and the project \u201cmoves forward\u201d in other states. The company promised it would have more news soon.",
      "Large pipeline projects typically rely on eminent domain, with companies arguing that even if most landowners agree to grant access to their property, a project can be scuttled if only a few refuse.",
      "Summit says the company, which has secured over 2,700 easements across the region, has approval for routes in Iowa and North Dakota and a leg in Minnesota.",
      "The current proposed route would cut through nearly 700 miles (1,126.5 kilometers) of South Dakota before entering North Dakota, so rerouting to the east through Minnesota would be a big challenge.",
      "A Summit spokesperson did not respond to questions Friday about whether the company would consider a new route.",
      "The sponsor of the South Dakota bill, Republican Rep. Karla Lems, said Summit could either reroute its pipeline through Minnesota into North Dakota or \u201cnegotiate with landowners in South Dakota\u201d and go around opponents.",
      "Gov. Rhoden said the South Dakota law wasn't intended to kill the project and suggested Summit see it as \u201can opportunity to reset.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is a relatively small part of Summit\u2019s overall project. The only segment approved in the state is a 28-mile (45-kilometer) leg from an ethanol plant near Fergus Falls to the North Dakota border. Summit\u2019s project also includes two legs in southern Minnesota that would go into Iowa.",
      "A Minnesota Public Utilities Commission spokesperson did not respond to phone or email messages.",
      "The country's transition to electric vehicles has been slower than many people expected, but most think a shift away from internal combustion engines will eventually happen.",
      "Nearly 40% of the nation's corn crop is brewed into ethanol, which is blended into most gasoline sold in the U.S. Midwest farmers and the ethanol industry therefore see it as essential to have new markets as less of the fuel additive goes to power cars.",
      "They see passenger jet fuel as a potentially huge new market for ethanol. However, under current rules the process for turning ethanol into aviation fuel would need to emit less carbon dioxide to qualify for tax breaks intended to reduce greenhouses.",
      "The carbon capture pipeline is a key part of achieving those goals, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said.",
      "Walt Wendland, who runs an ethanol plant in Onida, South Dakota, said the \u201cethanol industry is a margin business\u201d and the new state law will put South Dakota ethanol producers at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cEver since I built a plant, I never wanted an advantage, just don\u2019t put me at a disadvantage,\u201d Wendland said.",
      "It has been four years since Summit proposed building the pipeline, along with two other companies that later abandoned their plans. It has been a challenging process for Summit, which dealt with lawsuits in Nebraska and elsewhere, opposition before a regulatory commission in Iowa and now the eminent domain ban in South Dakota.",
      "In its statement, Summit expressed optimism about the future but didn't offer specifics about how it could build a pipeline without eminent domain authority in South Dakota.",
      "Since the pipeline was proposed, the federal government\u2019s approach to climate change also has changed dramatically. Democratic President Joe Biden increased tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to encourage carbon capture as an effort to slow climate change.",
      "However, Republican President Donald Trump has emphasized the need for more oil and gas drilling and coal mining, and has put far less emphasis on alternative energy. Trump has not indicated whether his views will lead to changing federal policy regarding carbon capture pipelines.",

      "KANEOHE, Hawaii -- Hawaii's American colonizers once banned the Hawaiian language in schools. Some Native Hawaiians tried to lighten their skin with lye. Many people believed Polynesian voyagers had simply lucked into finding the islands by drifting on logs.",
      "But a canoe launched half a century ago helped turn Hawaiian culture from a source of shame to one of pride, reviving the skill of traveling the seas by decoding the stars, waves and weather. That vessel \u2014 a double-hulled sailing canoe called the Hokulea, after the Hawaiian name for the star Arcturus \u2014 would even influence the Disney blockbuster \u201cMoana\u201d decades later.",
      "To mark the anniversary, the Hokulea's early crew members gathered Saturday for ceremonial hula and kava drinking at the Oahu beach where the canoe launched on March 8, 1975, and where they began their first training sails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a vehicle of exploration. It\u2019s a vehicle of discovery,\u201d Nainoa Thompson, the CEO of the Polynesian Voyaging Society, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s also been our vehicle for justice as Native Hawaiians, as Pacific Islanders, as a very unique, special culture of the Earth.\u201d",
      "In 1980, Thompson became the first Hawaiian in six centuries to navigate to Tahiti without a compass or other modern instruments \u2014 a span of about 2,700 miles (4,300 kilometers).",
      "Thompson, 71, remembers stories from his grandmother, born less than a decade after the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. Teachers beat her for speaking Hawaiian, and her uncle tried to wash the brown off his skin with lye.",
      "When she had children, she didn't teach them Hawaiian.",
      "\u201cIf her children tried to be Hawaiian, they would get hurt in the new society,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd so you have to become something else.\u201d",
      "A resurgence of Hawaiian pride and identity starting in the late 1960s and 1970s set off a cultural renaissance. Artist Herb Kane began painting ancient canoes based on drawings from European explorers and got the idea to build a double-hulled canoe with tall, triangular sails similar to those his ancestors had used hundreds of years earlier.",
      "At the time, many people accepted the notion that Polynesians settled islands by accident.",
      "Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl had theorized that Polynesians arrived from South America, pushed west by the prevailing winds and currents. In 1947, he set out to prove it by floating from Peru on a log raft. He landed in the Tuamotu Islands north of Tahiti and wrote a best-seller.",
      "Heyerdahl\u2019s theory took hold even though Hawaiians for generations had passed down stories of people who traveled from the distant lands -- including Kahiki, possibly what is today known as Tahiti \u2014 by canoe, bringing with them edible plants such as ulu, or breadfruit.",
      "Kane, University of Hawaii archaeologist Ben Finney and Honolulu surfer Tommy Holmes wanted to challenge the drifting log concept. They started the Polynesian Voyaging Society, intent on sailing a canoe to Tahiti without modern instruments.",
      "They needed a navigator. Traditional long-distance voyaging skills had all but disappeared, but a Peace Corps volunteer on the isolated atoll of Satawal in Micronesia told them about Pius \u201cMau\u201d Piailug, who had been taught navigation from childhood. Over about a month in 1976, Piailug guided the Hokulea from Hawaii to Tahiti \u2014 about the same distance from Hawaii to California.",
      "Some 17,000 people thronged the Tahitian shore to greet them and witness what one crew member called \u201cthe spaceship of our ancestors.\u201d",
      "Former Hawaii Gov. John Waihe\u2018e was in his 20s then, and a delegate to the 1978 state Constitutional Convention. The Hokulea\u2019s success spurred delegates to make Hawaiian an official state language even though few residents still spoke it, he said. They also created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to improve the well-being of Native Hawaiians.",
      "\u201cIt helped us believe in everything that we were doing,\u201d Waihe\u2018e said.",
      "Today, two dozen schools have Hawaiian language immersion programs, and Census data show more than 27,000 people in Hawaii, and 34,000 in the U.S., speak Hawaiian at home.",
      "In 1978, an ill-prepared crew set out for Tahiti in poor weather, and the Hokulea capsized just hours after leaving port. Crew member Eddie Aikau paddled his surfboard to get help. The Coast Guard rescued the canoe, but Aikau was never found.",
      "The voyaging society overhauled itself in response, setting clear goals and training requirements. Thompson studied at a Honolulu planetarium and spent over a year under the tutelage of Piailug. In 1980, he navigated to Tahiti.",
      "Thompson said he felt a deep obligation to fulfill Aikau\u2019s wish to follow the path of his ancestors and \u201cpull Tahiti out of the sea.\u201d But he didn't celebrate when the Hokulea got there.",
      "\u201cI just went into a quiet, dark place and just told Eddie we pulled it out of the sea,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no high fives. It\u2019s too profound.\u201d",
      "In decades since, the society has sailed the canoe around the Pacific and world, including New Zealand, Japan, South Africa and New York.",
      "It inspired other Pacific Island communities to revive or newly appreciate their own wayfinding traditions.",
      "In Rapa Nui, Chile \u2014 also known as Easter Island \u2014 islanders have embarked on long-distance canoe voyages. The University of Guam has a navigation program. Similar trends have surfaced in the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Samoa and Tonga, said Mary Therese Perez Hattori, the director of the Pacific Islands Development Program at the East-West Center.",
      "\u201cWe come from very, very ancient societies,\u201d said Hattori, who is Chamorro, the Indigenous people of the Mariana Islands. \u201cHokulea sort of helped us remind the world of this.\u201d",
      "Hokulea\u2019s influence spread in 2016 when Disney released \u201cMoana,\u201d an animated film about a 16-year-old girl who learns wayfinding about 3,000 years ago.",
      "Thompson spoke to hundreds on the movie's creative team about wayfinding and the importance of canoes to Pacific culture, said Aaron Kandell, a Hawaii-born writer who worked on the movie.",
      "Kandell, who is not Native Hawaiian, spent a year studying navigation with the Polynesian Voyaging Society during his 20s and incorporated that into the script, including where Moana learns to use her outstretched hand to track the stars and runs her hand in the ocean to feel the currents.",
      "Crew members taught animators about coconut fiber ropes so they would look right when Moana pulls on them, Kandell said.",
      "The Polynesian Voyaging Society\u2019s initial plan was to sail to Tahiti once, supporting a documentary, book and research papers. Thompson remembers pushing Hokulea\u2019s hull into the water with the crew back in 1975.",
      "\u201cIt was really a moment \u2014 I didn\u2019t recognize it \u2014 but this was going to change everything,\u201d he said."

      "An Associated Press journalist has served as a media eyewitness to the execution of Brad Sigmon by firing squad Friday in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- I've now watched through glass and bars as 11 men were put to death at a South Carolina prison. None of the previous 10 prepared me for watching the firing squad death of Brad Sigmon on Friday night.",
      "I might now be unique among U.S. reporters: I've witnessed three different methods \u2014 nine lethal injections and an electric chair execution. I can still hear the thunk of the breaker falling 21 years later.",
      "As a journalist you want to ready yourself for an assignment. You research a case. You read about the subject.",
      "In the two weeks since I knew how Sigmon was going to die, I read up on firing squads and the damage that can be done by the bullets. I looked at the autopsy photos of the last man shot to death by the state, in Utah in 2010.",
      "I also pored over the transcript of his trial, including how prosecutors said it took less than two minutes for Sigmon to strike his ex-girlfriend's parents nine times each in the head with a baseball bat, going back and forth between them in different rooms of their Greenville County home in 2001 until they were dead.",
      "But you don't know everything when some of execution protocols are kept secret, and it's impossible to know what to expect when you've never seen someone shot at close range right in front of you.",
      "The firing squad is certainly faster \u2014 and more violent \u2014 than lethal injection. It's a lot more tense, too. My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon's lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon's head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.",
      "About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.",
      "It reminded me of what happened to the prisoner 21 years ago when electricity jolted his body.",
      "I tried to keep track, all at once, of the digital clock on the wall to my right, Sigmon to my left, the small, rectangular window with the shooters and the witnesses in front of me.",
      "A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.",
      "A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08 p.m.",
      "Then we left through the same door we came in.",
      "The sun was setting. The sky was a pretty pink and purple, a stark contrast to the death chamber's florescent lights, gray firing squad chair and block walls that reminded me of a 1970s doctor's office.",
      "The death chamber is less than a five-minute drive from Correction Department headquarters along a busy suburban highway. I always look out the window on the drive back from each execution. There is a pasture with cows behind a fence on one side, and on the other, I can see in the distance the razor wire of the prison.",
      "Armed prison employees were everywhere. We sat in vans outside the death chamber for what I guess was around 15 minutes, but I can't say for certain because my watch, cellphone and everything else was taken away for security, save for a pad and a pen.",
      "Over to my right, I saw the skinny, barred windows of South Carolina's death row. There were 28 inmates there earlier Friday, and now there are 27.",
      "That's down from 31 last August. After a 13-year pause while South Carolina struggled to obtain the drugs for lethal injections, the state has resumed executions. Inmates may choose between injections, electrocution or the firing squad.",
      "I witnessed Freddie Owens being put to death Sept. 20. He locked eyes with every witness in the room.",
      "I saw Richard Moore die Nov. 1, looking serenely at the celling as his lawyer, who became close to him while fighting for his life over a decade, wept.",
      "And I was there, too, when Marion Bowman Jr. died Jan. 31, a small smile on his face as he turned to his lawyer, then closed his eyes and waited.",
      "I remember other executions too. I've seen family members of victims stare down a killer on the gurney. I've seen a mother shed tears as she watched her son die, almost close enough to touch if the glass and bars weren't in the way.",
      "Like that thunk of the breaker back in 2004, I won't forget the crack of the rifles Friday and that target disappearing. Also etched in my mind: Sigmon talking or mouthing toward his lawyer, trying to let him know he was OK before the hood went on.",
      "I'll likely be back at Broad River Correctional Institution on April 11. Two more men on death row are out of appeals, and the state Supreme Court appears ready to schedule their deaths at five-week intervals.",
      "They would be the 12th and 13th men I've seen killed by the state of South Carolina. And when it is over, I will have witnessed more than a quarter of the state's executions since the death penalty was reinstated.",
      "___",
      "Collins was one of three media witnesses for the firing squad execution of Brad Sigmon. He has been a witness to 11 South Carolina executions during his nearly 25-year career with The Associated Press."

      "Facing the potential loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Duke University is preparing for the worst",
      "DURHAM, N.C. -- Facing the potential loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Duke University is preparing for the worst.",
      "Like research universities around the United States, the private school in North Carolina's Research Triangle would see a massive loss from Trump administration cuts to grants from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Duke would be among the hardest hit. In its previous fiscal year, Duke took in $580 million in NIH grants and contracts, 11th most among the country's research institutions. The cuts are delayed temporarily by a court challenge, but universities nationwide have implemented hiring freezes, scaled back research and drawn up contingency plans in case the loss in funding takes effect.",
      "Historically, the federal government has negotiated with colleges and universities on its contribution toward their operating costs. If a scientist wins a federal grant to fund their research, the government pays the school an additional amount as a percentage of the grant money.",
      "At Duke, the current rate for these \u201cindirect costs\u201d \u2014 expenses such as utilities and laboratory maintenance \u2014 is about 61%. Last month, President Donald Trump's administration set the rate cap at 15%, significantly less than most universities receive.",
      "The cut in indirect costs is far from the only concern. Funding for new grants also slowed to a trickle after the NIH halted grant application review meetings in January. At Duke, NIH grant and contract award notices plummeted, dropping from 166 in January and February of 2024 to 64 so far in 2025, according to the university.",
      "Already, the uncertainty is causing reverberations at Duke's School of Medicine, which receives over three-quarters of the university's NIH funding. Expansion projects are being shelved. Fewer Ph.D. students are being admitted. And researchers are assessing whether their projects can continue.",
      "The Trump administration has described indirect costs as \u201cadministrative bloat\u201d and said the cuts would save more than $4 billion annually. The change would also free up more money for scientific research, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to slashing the cottage industry built off of the waste, fraud, and abuse within our mammoth government while prioritizing the needs of everyday Americans,\u201d White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.",
      "Through NIH funding, universities for decades have partnered with the federal government to support scientists\u2019 academic pursuits.",
      "Duke pharmacology and cancer biology professor Donald McDonnell estimates his laboratory has received up to $40 million in NIH funding over 30 years. His lab developed a drug approved in 2023 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic breast cancer.",
      "Upkeep for lab equipment, including machines to grow cancer cells and massive freezers for enzymes and chemicals, would be difficult to afford if indirect cost rates dropped to 15%, McDonnell said. His laboratory also likely will be in the red due to the uncertainty around NIH grants, which would lead to staff layoffs.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is, I can\u2019t live, I can\u2019t think in this chaos,\u201d McDonnell said.",
      "Duke's total research budget last fiscal year was $1.33 billion, with $863 million coming from the federal government. Without NIH funding, many scientists would have to turn to private organizations and philanthropies, which typically offer substantially less money, researchers said.",
      "\u201cWe have long-standing relationships with private funders and industry partners, and value the contributions they make, but federal funds by far provide the largest single source of research dollars,\" said Geeta Swamy, executive vice dean of the School of Medicine.",
      "The cap on indirect costs also would hinder research for incoming neurosurgery and biomedical engineering professor Nanthia Suthana, who is relocating from the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "To study brain activity and treat conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Suthana requires a lab large enough for patients to walk around while headsets and monitors capture heart rate, eye tracking, perspiration and brainwaves. Along the walls, 40 to 50 cameras \u2014 each costing about $5,000 \u2014 record their movements.",
      "Her new lab is under construction, but Suthana said she is worried she will have to downsize within a year if funding uncertainties persist.",
      "Duke's medical school has scaled back the number of Ph.D. students it will admit for the upcoming fall semester. Last year, the school brought in about 130 students, said Beth Sullivan, who oversees the school\u2019s 17 biomedical Ph.D. programs. Now, the target is 100 students or less.",
      "That means smaller class sizes over time and, in turn, a shrinking pipeline into medical research careers, she said.",
      "\u201cOur next generation of researchers are now poised on the edge of this cliff, not knowing if there\u2019s going to be a bridge that's going to get them to the other side, or if this is it,\u201d Sullivan said.",
      "Of the more than 630 Ph.D. students in the medical school, nearly all the students in their second year and beyond receive federal support from either NIH or the National Science Foundation.",
      "Third-year doctoral student Caleb McIver was applying for an NIH diversity supplement \u2014 a funding opportunity to encourage professors to train minority students \u2014 when information about the initiative was removed from the agency\u2019s website. McIver, who is Black, is now looking into other NIH grants without ties to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the Trump administration has been wiping out of the federal government.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty stressed,\u201d McIver said. \u201cI mean, I need funding, so we need to find it.\u201d",
      "The university had been planning to build a new research building on the site of an old, recently vacated building. Now those plans are on hold, School of Medicine Vice Dean Colin Duckett said.",
      "Even smaller projects like renovating a building floor can\u2019t start because of the budget uncertainty. Hundreds of people working in shuttered labs will consolidate in other buildings. If the indirect costs rate drops to 15%, there also would be widespread layoffs, Duckett said.",
      "Duckett\u2019s job previously focused on recruiting the brightest scientists and providing them with resources at Duke, he said. Now, he has taken on a much different role.",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease, and his wife died of hantavirus",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found dead Feb. 26. In the days that followed, mystery swirled around the deaths as authorities ruled out foul play, and immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Then authorities in New Mexico released the causes, proposing a simple but tragic theory for the deaths: Shortly after Arakawa's death from a rare infection, Hackman died of the nation\u2019s leading killer \u2014 heart disease \u2014 apparently unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cI believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case,\" said forensic pathologist Dr. Victor Weedn, who was not involved in the investigation. \u201cIt seemed such a great mystery to the entire nation.\u201d",
      "Here's a timeline of events surrounding the couple's deaths:",
      "Arakawa's last known activities happened this day. She emailed with a massage therapist in the late morning, visited a grocery store in Santa Fe in the afternoon, then went to a pharmacy and a pet food store, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said.",
      "At 5:15 p.m., Arakawa entered the gated community to the home she shared with Hackman. Mendoza said investigators found no other communication or activity by Arakawa after Feb. 11, which they believe to be the day of her death. The medical examiner said she may have been experiencing symptoms of hantavirus before her death.",
      "Hackman\u2019s initial pacemaker data revealed cardiac activity Feb. 17. Subsequent pacemaker investigation showed an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation Feb. 18, the last record of heart activity.",
      "Based on this information, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said it is reasonable to conclude that Hackman probably died around Feb. 18.",
      "A maintenance worker who showed up to do routine work at the house could not get inside and called a security worker, who spotted two people on the ground inside the home, Mendoza said. The worker called 911 and told an operator he did not know if they were breathing. He and another worker later told authorities that they rarely saw the homeowners and that their last contact with them had been about two weeks prior.",
      "Police found Hackman in an entryway and Arakawa in a bathroom, as well as a deceased dog in a closet.",
      "Arakawa had picked up the kelpie mix named Zinna from Gruda Veterinary Hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure was done, according to the sheriff. He said the hospital visit might help explain why the dog was found dead. A necropsy is being done on Zinna to determine the cause of death, he said.",
      "Two healthy dogs were found on the property \u2014 one inside and one outside.",
      "Autopsies were done on Hackman and Arakawa. Detectives wrote in a search warrant that the couple and the dog had been dead for some time when the maintenance worker discovered their bodies.",
      "Preliminary autopsy results didn't reveal causes of death but showed Hackman and Arakawa were not killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, the sheriff said. The initial autopsies also found no external trauma to either body.",
      "Authorities reveal causes of death for Hackman and Arakawa. Jarrell said both deaths were from natural causes.",
      "Hackman\u2019s death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing. Authorities linked Betsy Arakawa\u2019s death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings."

      "Activists say an Alabama teenager's incarceration in an adult jail violates federal and state laws that require inmates who are minors to be separated from adults",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Djovani Jean-Pierre spent his 17th birthday in a small county jail in rural northern Alabama, where he has languished for more than half the school year awaiting trial.",
      "On the advice of his 51-year-old cellmate, Jean-Pierre avoids contact with others in the jail. The Black teen of Haitian descent has seen inmates with swastika tattoos and witnessed beatings, and he has had no in-person or virtual visits from his parents in the nearly six months he has been behind bars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\" Jean-Pierre told The Associated Press. \"I just stay in my cell.\u201d",
      "His case highlights the potential danger of state laws that automatically send teen suspects to adult detention facilities.",
      "Jean-Pierre is charged with first-degree robbery, second-degree assault and two misdemeanors, and is jailed under an Alabama law that gives judges more discretion to deny bail for some people accused of violent crimes. He had no prior arrests, but if convicted could be sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Local activists and juvenile justice advocates say teenagers incarcerated with adults are more vulnerable to abuse and that Jean-Pierre\u2019s situation clearly violates state and federal laws prohibiting the confinement of minors \u201cwhere they may have sight, sound, or physical contact with adult inmates.\u201d The sheriff says to abide by those laws, Jean-Pierre would have to be held in solitary confinement, which could also be severely damaging.",
      "The number of teenagers in U.S. adult prisons or jails dropped from a two-decade high of 10,420 in 2008 to a low of 2,250 in 2021, according to the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics data. Almost 90% of those teens are in local jails where people are typically held prior to conviction.",
      "Prosecutors said \u201cseveral eyewitnesses\u201d saw Jean-Pierre, then 16, use a gun to steal a loaded pistol from someone at a party in September. No gun was fired and no one was injured.",
      "Acting on a tip, a school resource officer detained him during football practice the following day and found the stolen firearm in his bag. Jean-Pierre is also accused of assaulting the school resource officer.",
      "Authorities said Jean-Pierre was arrested for stealing the gun but that there is no evidence he intended to use it at school.",
      "At the time, Jean-Pierre's lawyer said the charges and his confinement were racially motivated, given tensions in Albertville surrounding the small town\u2019s growing Haitian population. Nearly 1,000 people signed a petition attesting to the teen's character and supporting his transfer to juvenile court, where cases are sealed and minors are held in youth facilities.",
      "But Marshall County District Attorney Jennifer Bray said state law and evidence including witness testimony prevented her from charging him as a juvenile. Bray is optimistic she will find a resolution with Jean-Pierre\u2019s attorney that balances accountability with compassion so he can make positive changes in his life, she wrote in an email.",
      "A slew of laws that took effect in 2024 escalate criminal punishments for teenagers, amid a broader return to a tough-on-crime approach nationwide. Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee and Louisiana made it easier to charge teenagers in adult court. Proponents say these laws increase public safety. Opponents say the changes jeopardize the safety of minors accused of crimes.",
      "In Alabama, laws that automatically send teenagers to adult jails have existed for years, meaning some minors are held in general population with adults in violation of federal law, said Charlotte Morrison, a senior attorney with the Equal Justice Initiative.",
      "Morrison recalled at least five counties where she has worked with or learned of teenagers who were abused because they were held with adults. Adult facilities cannot safely house children and teenagers, she said, and the focus should instead be their reintegration into the community.",
      "Richard Rice, a civil rights attorney representing Jean-Pierre, said the teenager had been a strong student but that he doesn't have access to school materials in jail.",
      "\u201cDjovani deserves compassion and a second chance to learn from this experience rather than subjecting him to unnecessary detainment that fails to serve his best interests or those of the community,\u201d Rice said.",
      "Minors are eight times as likely to experience sexual abuse in an adult jail than inmates over 18, according to the Department of Justice, and are more than twice as likely to die by suicide compared to jail inmates aged 18 to 24. One study found minors who are incarcerated with adults are 33% more likely to die before they turn 39 compared to all other teenagers.",
      "Numerous public defenders, juvenile justice attorneys and advocates told the AP they are shocked that Jean-Pierre isn't separated from adults in the jail.",
      "\u201cWe know it is such well settled law now that you cannot house children with adults,\u201d said Preston Shipp, a former Tennessee assistant attorney general and current policy director for the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. \u201cThis is not a gray area anymore.\u201d",
      "Marshall County Sheriff Phil Sims said the jail doesn\u2019t have the capacity to house Jean-Pierre separately from adults without putting him in solitary confinement.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s more detrimental than anything else, especially to mental health,\u201d said Sims.",
      "He said Jean-Pierre is housed with people charged with non-violent crimes and that he hasn\u2019t had any disciplinary issues.",
      "Jean-Pierre said his original cellmate, who is now in another facility, was an invaluable resource.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my cellmate, Marcus, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cHe just kept being positive, saying \u2018the trouble will pass, take this as a lesson.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jean-Pierre had hoped he would be recruited to play football in college or join the Army.",
      "Now, he said, the uncertainty about his future is the hardest thing to bear.",
      "\u201cI want everyone to know I\u2019m not a bad person. I just made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that whenever I can get out, I can change everybody\u2019s mind, do right.\u201d",

      "Three tribal nations and five Native American students have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, accusing it of failing its legal obligations to tribes when it cut jobs at Bureau of Indian Education schools last month",
      "NORMAN, Okla. -- Three tribal nations and five Native American students filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration, accusing it of failing its legal obligations to tribes when it cut jobs at Bureau of Indian Education schools last month.",
      "Firings at two colleges as part of the administration\u2019s cuts to federal agencies, with the help of Elon Musk, have left students and staff with unsafe conditions, cancelled classes, and delayed financial aid, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Lawyers at the Native American Rights Fund filed the suit against the heads of the Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Indian Education Programs on behalf of the Pueblo of Isleta, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes. The tribes allege in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that they were not consulted when the federal government laid off several employees at the two colleges under the purview of the BIE.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the staff at the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, including nine instructors, were fired or forced to resign in February. The lawsuit alleges that security and maintenance firings have left the campus unsafe, including two power outages in the last few weeks that went unresolved due to the lack of staff.",
      "One SIPI student named in the lawsuit, Kaiya Brown, said in the filing that her dorm was without power for 13 hours. \u201cMs. Brown was forced to leave her dorm residence and drive to a second location to be able to complete her school assignments.\u201d",
      "Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas lost over a quarter of its staff, including \u201cthe Dean of Students, instructors, property management specialists, coaches, tutors, residential advisors, academic advisors, custodians, and food services employees\u201d as well as its only bus driver, the lawsuit states. It also notes that Haskell's student center has been shuttered and students reported their financial aid has either been delayed or has not been disbursed.",
      "Students also reported reduced meal sizes, bathrooms without toilet paper, and classes that are now being taught by deans who do not have the same expertise as the professors who were fired.",
      "Both institutions report that some staff and faculty have been rehired, but \u201cBIE notified those individuals that this might be temporary and they may be laid off again,\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "When reached for comment, the BIA said, \u201cIt is Department policy to not comment on pending litigation.\u201d",
      "The BIE is responsible for providing educational opportunities for Native Americans and Alaska Natives across the country, part of the U.S. government's trust responsibilities \u2014 the legal and moral obligations the U.S. has to protect and uphold treaties, laws and congressional acts dealing with tribes.",
      "\u201cThere are 183 Bureau-funded elementary and secondary schools, located on 64 reservations in 23 states, serving approximately 42,000 Indian students,\u201d according to the BIE\u2019s website. \u201cOf these, 55 are BIE-operated, and 128 are tribally operated.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office has highlighted for several years significant understaffing at the BIE that has impacted its ability to monitor and assist schools.",
      "One of the federal government's obligations to tribal nations is to provide meaningful consultation before it takes any action that could possibly harm tribes or their services, said Hershel Gorham, Lt. Governor of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, which has 35 students at Haskell. \"In this case there is no consultation that was done, not only from the BIA and BIE, but the federal government in general.\u201d",
      "Recent cuts to the Departments of the Interior and Health and Human Services that affect tribal citizens and were later rescinded might illustrate that Secretaries Doug Burgum and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. understand those trust responsibilities, Gorham said, but they also might suggest they don't have the autonomy to prevent the violation of those rights for Native Americans.",
      "\u201cRight now it seems like they\u2019re not being given that full autonomy, if you look at the cuts that were made to Haskell, SIPI and the BIE schools,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON -- The leaders of both Canada and Mexico got on the phone with President Donald Trump this past week to seek solutions after he slapped tariffs on their countries, but China\u2019s president appears unlikely to make a similar call soon.",
      "Beijing, which unlike America's close partners and neighbors has been locked in a trade and tech war with the U.S. for years, is taking a different approach to Trump in his second term, making it clear that any negotiations should be conducted on equal footing.",
      "China\u2019s leaders say they are open to talks, but they also made preparations for the higher U.S. tariffs, which have risen 20% since Trump took office seven weeks ago. Intent on not being caught off guard as they were during Trump's first term, the Chinese were ready with retaliatory measures \u2014 imposing their own taxes this past week on key U.S. farm imports and more.",
      "\u201cAs Washington escalates the tariff, Beijing doesn\u2019t see other options but to retaliate,\u201d said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean Beijing doesn\u2019t want to negotiate, but it cannot be seen as begging for talks or mercy.\u201d",
      "As the world's second-largest economy, China aspires to be a great power on both the regional and global stage, commanding respect from all countries, especially the United States, as proof that the Communist Party has made China prosperous and strong.",
      "After the U.S. this past week imposed another 10% tariff, on top of the 10% imposed on Feb. 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet: \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "The harsh rhetoric echoed similar comments in 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war with China and it scrambled to line up tit-for-tat actions. Beijing\u2019s leaders have since developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China.",
      "All are designed to inflict pain on the U.S. economy and businesses in response to the American measures.",
      "That allowed the Chinese government to react swiftly to Trump\u2019s recent across-the-board doubling of new tariffs on Chinese goods by rolling out a basket of retaliatory measures, including taxing many American farm goods at up to 15%, suspending U.S. lumber imports and blacklisting 15 U.S. companies.",
      "Beijing showed restraint in its response to leave room for negotiation, analysts say.",
      "Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership of the ruling Communist Party spans both of Trump\u2019s terms, giving Beijing more continuity in its planning. He is the one who decided it's not yet time to speak with Trump, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a scheduling issue, it\u2019s leverage for China,\u201d said Russel, who previously served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. \u201cXi won\u2019t walk into a call if there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be harassed or humiliated and for both political and strategic reasons, Xi won\u2019t play the role of a supplicant.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, China is hitting back promptly \u2014 but judiciously \u2014 to each set of tariffs,\u201d Russel said.",
      "At his annual press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that \u201cno country should fantasize that it can suppress, contain China while developing good relations with China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch two-faced acts not only are bad for the stability of bilateral relations but also will not build mutual trust,\" Wang said. He added that China welcomes cooperation with the U.S., but noted that \u201cif you keep pressuring, China will firmly retaliate.\u201d",
      "Scott Kennedy, a trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese this time are \u201cnot psychologically shocked\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cshock-and-awe\u201d tactics.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThese are the kind of things that they\u2019ve anticipated.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s economy has slowed but is still growing at nearly a 5% annual pace, and under Xi, the party is investing heavily in advanced technology, education and other areas. It has stronger trade ties with many other countries than during Trump's first term and has diversified where it gets key products, for example, buying most of its soybeans from Brazil and Argentina instead of the U.S.",
      "In turn, the percentage of Chinese goods sold to the U.S. has fallen.",
      "\u201cThey are better prepared to absorb the effect of the shocks, compared to several years ago,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 80% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S., and Canada sends 75% of its exports here.",
      "China has learned from its previous dealings with Trump, Russel said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are facing a reversal of Trump\u2019s previous trade policies, with tariffs imposed and then postponed twice on at least some goods.",
      "\u201cBeijing has seen enough to know that appeasing Trump doesn\u2019t work,\" Russel said. In the first go-around, Trudeau and Sheinbaum \"bought a little time, but the pressure only came roaring back stronger.\u201d",
      "Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump in December after the president-elect threatened tariffs. But in announcing retaliatory tariffs Tuesday, Trudeau sternly warned: \u201cThis is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\u201d",

      "HUDSON: \u201cI just said that, it\u2019s very important that all of us are communicating with our constituents, are very visible in our districts, very accessible. And it\u2019s a shame that Democrat organizations are paying people to disrupt in-person town halls.

      "Attorneys for Jessie Hoffman Jr. argued against the capital punishment method of nitrogen hypoxia in a Baton Rouge federal court on Friday.",
      "The hearing occurred a week after Hoffman filed a lawsuit seeking to block his March 18 execution date, when nitrogen will be pumped into a mask strapped onto Hoffman, who was convicted of the 1996 execution-style murder of Mary Elliott in New Orleans.",
      "Among their arguments, Hoffman's attorneys said nitrogen hypoxia is cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution and infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice his religion, specifically Buddhist breathing and meditation exercises. They also argued the method, which involves an industrial, full-face mask, will ignite and worsen his diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder and claustrophobia, causing mental torture.",
      "The execution protocol lacks transparency, they argued, noting that under the policy Hoffman's attorneys do not fall under the list of \u201crequired witnesses\u201d to the execution.",
      "Death by firing squad and medical-aid in dying, taking an oral solution of drugs mixed with apple juice, are alternative execution methods that would be more \u201chumane,\u201d Hoffman\u2019s attorneys said.",

      "Murrill told The Associated Press last month that she expects at least four people will be executed this year. There are 56 inmates on Louisiana\u2019s death row.",
      "Louisiana is following in the footsteps of Alabama, which has executed four people with nitrogen gas. If Hoffman's capital punishment is carried out as scheduled, Louisiana will become the second state to use the method.",
      "Officials say Louisiana's execution protocol is nearly identical to Alabama, where an inmate is strapped to a gurney and forced to breathe pure nitrogen gas through a mask placed on their face, depriving them of oxygen.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama has appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including the AP.",
      "The reactions are involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation, state officials have said."

      "Facing spiking energy demand, U.S. states are pressing for ways to build new power plants faster as policymakers try to protect residents from higher electric bills and keep their economies on track",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Facing projections of spiking energy demand, U.S. states are pressing for ways to build new power plants faster as policymakers increasingly worry about protecting their residents and economies from rising electric bills, power outages and other consequences of falling behind Big Tech in a race for electricity.",
      "Some states are dangling financial incentives. Others are undoing decades of regulatory structures in what they frame as a race to serve the basic needs of residents, avoid a catastrophe and keep their economies on track in a fast-electrifying society.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything quite like this,\u201d said Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents independent power plant owners.",
      "The spike in demand for electricity is being driven, in large part, by the artificial intelligence race as tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking power to feed their energy-hungry data centers. Federal incentives to rebuild the manufacturing sector also are helping drive demand.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is arranging its own power projects.",
      "But energy companies also are searching for ways to capitalize on opportunities afforded by the first big increase in electricity consumption in a couple of decades, and that is pitting state political leaders against each other for the new jobs and investment that come with new power plants.",
      "Moves by states come as a fossil fuel - friendly President Donald Trump and Republican-controlled Congress take power in Washington, D.C., slashing regulations around oil and gas, boostingdrilling opportunities and encouraging the construction of pipelines and refineries that can export liquefied natural gas.",
      "States are seeking action, with the National Governors Association asking Congress to make it easier and faster to build power plants and criticizing the U.S. as among the slowest developed nations in approving energy projects.",
      "But there may be less that the federal government can do right away about a looming power shortage, since greenlighting power plants to feed the electric grid is largely the province of state regulators and regional grid operators.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wants to establish an agency to fast-track the construction of big power plants and dangle hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects providing electricity to the grid.",
      "The state, and the country, needs more power plants to win the artificial intelligence race and provide reliable and affordable power to residents, said Shapiro, who suggested Pennsylvania may leave the regional grid operated by PJM Interconnection in favor of \u201cgoing it alone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has proven over the last number of years too darn hard to get enough new generation projects off the ground because of how slow PJM\u2018s queue is,\u201d Shapiro told a news conference on Feb. 27.",
      "Indiana, Michigan and Louisiana are exploring ideas to attract nuclear power while Maryland lawmakers are floating ideas about commissioning the construction of a new power plant there.",
      "In Ohio, a lawmaker wants to restrict the influence of electric utilities in hopes of giving independent power producers more incentive to build power plants to feed the state's fast-growing tech sector.",
      "The bill, which awaits a vote, won the support of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel, the state's residential ratepayer watchdog, and business groups whose members care about electric prices. However, it split the energy sector between companies operating in competitive markets and those operating under state utility monopolies.",
      "In Missouri, utilities including Ameren and Evergy, as well as the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, labor unions and the state's top utility regulator are backing legislation to repeal a nearly half-century old law preventing utilities from charging customers to build a power plant until it is operational.",
      "The law was approved in a 1976 voter referendum when states were looking to hedge against utilities saddling ratepayers with financing upfront, potentially bloated, inefficient or, worse, aborted power projects.",
      "Consumer and environmental groups protested the bill, saying it would result in new natural gas plants that are likelier to be more costly to ratepayers.",
      "Last year, similar legislation passed almost unanimously in Kansas, along with companion legislation extending tax breaks to new power plants.",
      "Within months, Evergy announced alongside the state's leaders that it would build two 705-megawatt natural gas plants and said the legislation will \u201chelp Kansas compete with other states for investment and ultimately save customers money.\u201d",
      "John Coffman, the utility consumer counsel for the Consumers Council of Missouri, said utilities are playing the two states, Missouri and Kansas, against each other and were planning to build the power plants anyway.",
      "But, he said, \u201cThey're just looking for opportunities to squeeze more money out of the process.\"",
      "Snitchler said action is being spurred by states realizing that longstanding power reserves are dwindling, especially as coal-fired and nuclear power plants retire, and now all sorts of power companies are leaping at the chance to make money.",
      "A pitfall he sees in the race to build plants is an undoing of protections that some states once adopted to shield ratepayers and put the risk of building expensive power projects onto corporate shareholders.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is it shifts the risk back on the people who perhaps should not be bearing it,\u201d Snitchler said.",
      "A Pennsylvania state lawmaker, Sen. Gene Yaw, wants to set up a massive power plant-financing fund like Texas, which established a $10 billion low-interest loan program after the state was wracked by a deadly winter blackout in 2021.",
      "Yaw, a Republican, has no misgivings about Pennsylvania helping finance power plants. Even by conservative estimates, the state will need dozens more power plants to meet projections of rising demand, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd what do we have underway or planned right now? Nothing,\" Yaw said. \"And we haven\u2019t built anything since 2019. So we\u2019ve got to do something to encourage people to come here and build in Pennsylvania just to maintain the status quo.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's flurry of tariffs, government layoffs and spending freezes may be doing more to harm the U.S. economy than to fix it",
      "WASHINGTON -- With his flurry of tariffs, government layoffs and spending freezes, there are growing worries President Donald Trump may be doing more to harm the U.S. economy than to fix it.",
      "The labor market remains healthy with a 4.1% unemployment rate and 151,000 jobs added in February, and Trump likes to point to investment commitments by Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to show that he's delivering results.",
      "But Friday's employment report also found that the number of people stuck working part-time because of economic circumstances jumped by 460,000 last month. In the leisure and hospitality sectors that reflect consumers having extra money to spend, 16,000 jobs were lost. And the federal government reduced its payrolls by 10,000 in a potential harbinger of the alarm being sounded by the stock market, consumer confidence and other measures of where the economy is headed.",
      "Since January, the economic policy uncertainty index has spiked 41% to a level, 334.5, that in the past signaled a recession. Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist and co-developer of the uncertainty index, said it's unclear how this will play out, but he's worried.",
      "\u201cI have an increasing fear we will enter into what may become known as the \u2018Trump recession,'\" he said. \"Ongoing policy turbulence and a tariff war could tip the U.S. economy into its first recession in five years.\u201d That last recession occurred under Trump because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "For his part, Trump seems comfortable with the uncertainty that he's generating, saying that any financial pain from import taxes is a mere \u201cdisruption\u201d that will eventually lead to more factories relocating to the United States and stronger growth.",
      "If Trump's gambit succeeds, the Republican would cement his reputation as an unconventional leader who proved doubters wrong. But if Trump's tariffs backfire, much of the price would be paid by everyday Americans who could suffer from job losses, lower wages, higher inflation and, possibly, an injured sense of national pride.",
      "In an interview to air Sunday on Fox News' \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Trump was pressed to provide some clarity on his tariffs agenda that has caused uncertainty to fester. The president largely hedged his answer and blamed the 6% drop in the stock market over the past two weeks on \u201cbig globalists.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up and, you know, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s predictability,\u201d the president said.",
      "The White House maintains that Friday's jobs report showed the administration's strategy is working because manufacturers added 10,000 jobs. Of the manufacturing gains, 8,900 jobs came from the auto sector, recovering some of the industry's job losses in January. The White House also suggested that the loss of leisure and hospitality jobs was the result of flu season and people having depleted savings and credit card debt because of President Joe Biden's term.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a really, really impressive jobs report,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said of Friday's numbers.",
      "Hassett said the additional factory jobs were the result of companies \u201con-shoring\u201d work because of the coming tariffs.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of many reports that are going to look like this,\u201d Hassett said with regard to the hiring in the industrial sector.",
      "The stock market selloff raises doubts about whether tariffs will create the promised jobs.",
      "\u201cMarkets anticipate,\u201d said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \u201cThe turn down the dark alley of tariffs signals higher inflation, slower economic growth and a weaker U.S. dollar. It is an economic horror movie in slow motion.\u201d",
      "Trump has instigated a trade war in the last week with Canada, Mexico and China, only to then hit a monthlong pause on some of his import taxes because of the threat to U.S. auto factory jobs and because of Mexico's latest efforts to curb fentanyl smuggling.",
      "More tariffs are coming on April 2 for Europe, Trump says, possibly putting the United States into open conflict with a continent it helped rebuild after World War II. South Korea, India and Brazil could also face new tariffs, Trump said in his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.",
      "Silvia said Trump\u2019s tariffs need to be more targeted with regard to products and nations and set at lower rates, adding that doing so would provide an assurance that there is solid research backing the measures.",
      "There were multiple signs of uncertainty and concerns about the tariffs in the Federal Reserve\u2019s beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses that the Fed releases eight times a year.",
      "Published Wednesday, the beige book included 47 references to uncertainty, up from just 17 in the previous edition in January.",
      "\u201cMany businesses noted heightened economic uncertainty and expressed concern about tariffs,\u201d the Fed\u2019s New York branch reported. \u201cLooking ahead, businesses were notably less optimistic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the perfect storm for businesses,\u201d said Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College. \u201cHow can you possibly plan anything in this environment?\u201d",
      "Still, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday on CNBC that he sees positive momentum in combating inflation. He said crude oil prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration, as have the interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes and mortgages.",
      "Still, interest rates on government debt are higher than they were last year in September, and the recent decline could reflect a slowdown in economic demand.",
      "Bessent suggested a core problem is that the U.S. economy has become overly reliant on government deficits and that the Trump administration would be fostering stronger growth in the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve become addicted to this government spending, and there\u2019s going to be a detox period,\u201d he said.",
      "This particular form of economic rehab is coming from Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, which is led by T-shirted tech mogul Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, X and SpaceX, among other companies.",
      "The alleged savings by DOGE are still too paltry to bend the troubling trajectory of the national debt that is largely being driven by tax revenues that are insufficient to cover the rising costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "But the initiative has started to downsize the federal workforce in ways that could surface in future jobs reports. Roughly 75,000 employees took the deferred resignation plan. There are also thousands of probationary federal workers who were fired and tens of thousands of layoffs to come based on the administration's plans.",
      "Asked Friday in the Oval Office if the government layoffs could hurt the overall labor market, Trump said the economy would be great.",
      "\u201cI think the labor market is going to be fantastic, but it\u2019s going to have high-paying manufacturing jobs,\u201d he said. \u201dWe had too many people in government. You can't just do that.\"",

      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",

      "Giant trolley scales are being trialled at a Tesco store in Gateshead sparking a mixed reaction from shoppers.",
      "Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice.",
      "But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. \"Am I at border control or Tesco?\" one Reddit user posted, while another joked \"No clubcard? Deported!\"",
      "Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment.",
      "Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end.",
      "Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items they've scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley.",
      "'Treated like a thief'",
      "Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying \"they are 10x more convenient and faster\", many were more critical of their introduction.",
      "\"More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief,\" one said, while another wrote \"the point of all this is to save on staff\".",
      "Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs.",
      "\"There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. It's supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed.\"",
      "He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts.",
      "\"This is supermarkets saying, 'we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft'.",
      "\"They're forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers don't feel trusted or think they're being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is \"out of control\" after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers \u00a32bn.",
      "Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period.",
      "That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003.",
      "Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was \"definitely an element of trying to control loss\" but added \"let's not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental\".",
      "A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43% had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found.",
      "Prof Taylor said Tesco's scales were \"quite foreboding and reminiscent of security scanners\".",
      "\"They don't want to give the impression that they are pointing the finger at their honest customer,\" she said.",
      "\"They will need to balance how they respond when there is a weight discrepancy because you can lose a customer for life if they feel they've been wrongly accused of something.\"",
      "She said she could see customers getting frustrated using the scales.",
      "\"You've left your handbag in the trolley, you've got to take your child out of the seat, you might be queueing behind someone who has been stopped and you can't get through so the trial needs to focus on minimising friction points in the customer experience.\"",
      "The scales are the latest example of supermarkets turning to technology to streamline time and costs. The ratio of self-scan to staffed tills continues to be fiercely debated. Some shoppers love the speed and convenience while others are fed up of hearing \"unexpected item in the bagging area\".",
      "In August upmarket north of England supermarket chain Booths got rid of self-scan altogether, while Asda and Morrisons said they would put more staff back on manned tills."

      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "President Donald Trump's decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers.",

      "The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.",
      "White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a \"a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency\", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.",
      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "That meant, Sacks told reporters, they are only \"allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.\"",
      "Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a \"horrible precedent\" and \"makes no sense.\"",

      "Other analysts though have been more positive.",
      "\"This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.",
      "\"It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence.\"",
      "'Won't cost a dime'",
      "Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House.",
      "It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\".",
      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",
      "His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.",

      "\"Ultimately, tariffs would push down on growth\", Greene said, adding that there was a \"tonne of uncertainty\" about how Trump's tariffs would play out, but there would probably be more negatives for UK the economic activity than positives.",

      "Trump mulls exemption for some carmakers from tariffs",

      "Mr Trump and his administration have said higher tariffs on goods imported into the US will help it get better deals with allies and rivals around the world.",
      "But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world.",
      "Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises.",
      "Some of Trump's allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing.",
      "Bailey said the move would be a \"very damaging thing for the world\".",

    "story": [
      "War, cross-border conflict and geopolitical upheaval are rarely deemed good for business.",
      "Yet that appears to have been the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on two of the aggressor's neighbours to its west \u2013 Finland and Sweden.",
      "Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations' response to the invasion that turned fear into hope.",
      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",
      "In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out.",
      "What is Nato and how much do members spend on defence?",
      "Jeremy Bowen: Trump-Zelensky row signals looming crisis between Europe and US",
      "Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine",
      "And while the White House this week announced a pause in US military aid to Ukraine, European leaders have declared they're in it for the long haul, so here too we can expect substantial and ongoing spending on arms.",
      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",
      "\"The US really protects its own defence industry, and we should do the same in Europe,\" he says, as he welcomes \"fierce competition\" between commercial defence companies.",
      "Much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defence industry, however.",
      "Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato.",
      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",
      "Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free.",
      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",
      "Nato's newest members believe they could teach other allied countries a thing or two about defence. They clearly offer new perspectives both on how defence spending should be measured. And perhaps also on how civilian society and private enterprise can play their parts.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",

      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",

      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",

      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"",

    "story": [
      "Academics from leading universities have condemned the decision to pull a scheme aimed at expanding the teaching of Latin in the state sector.",
      "The \u00a34m, four-year project was introduced by the Conservative government in 2022, but that was ditched by Labour in February with immediate effect.",
      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",
      "The government said it inherited a deficit which meant \"tough decisions were needed\", but Latin GCSE pupils sitting exams in summer would get support.",
      "There are some state schools that still offer pupils the chance to learn a language some describe as dead.",
      "At Keswick School in Cumbria, the subject is studied after hours as an extra option.",
      "For the last 10 years it has been taught to GCSE level by Marcella Jackson who said it is not just for the academic elite.",
      "\"We offer Latin to pupil premium students, to children from different sets, abilities and backgrounds,\" Ms Jackson said.",
      "\"They all like languages, they like history and it's nice to give them an opportunity they wouldn't get anywhere else.\"",
      "Some of her former GCSE students say they have benefited from their insight into the ancient language.",
      "Marianne, who is now in the sixth form, said: \"I want to become a vet and in medicine it's a kind of universal language for all sorts of things, so it's really useful.\"",
      "Classmate Richard said: \"I really enjoyed learning where the words have come that we use in modern English, and so many European languages are all derived from Latin.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School is another that offers the language to GCSE level, but as part of the main school day.",
      "When I visited they had a Latin VIP in their lesson.",
      "Prof Arlene Holmes-Henderson leads a department at Durham University dedicated to promoting the study of Latin and the Classics.",
      "She had a stark statistic to pass on to the Latin learners: \"In the state sector, you have four times more chance of being able to study a classical subject in London and the South East than you do in the North East.\"",
      "She said that means many pupils studying in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall are missing out on the benefits of Latin.",
      "'Unlock literacy'",
      "During a seven-year research project, Prof Holmes-Henderson discovered Latin study made the most difference to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",
      "She found there were \"three groups of pupils who benefited most - young people with special educational needs and disabilities, students who speak English as an additional language and those who qualify for free school meals\".",
      "\"All three groups, who face barriers to their learning, unlocked significant benefits in English literacy.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School's Latin teacher Cathy Bothwell said helping the disadvantaged is the reason the school has persevered with the subject.",
      "She said: \"Despite the cost of offering the subject, it is that social justice aspect.",
      "\"We have a very varied demographic and providing everyone with access to demanding academic subjects like Latin is a key part of that.\"",
      "There is another divide too.",
      "A British Society study in 2020 found that while only 3% of state schools offered Latin at Key Stage 3, that figure rose to 49% in the fee-paying sector.",
      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",
      "\"We cannot have the whole classics agenda being in the hands of the few, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and [instead] ensure there is something there for the benefit of classical education across the UK.\"",
      "'Latin is for everyone'",
      "A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The \u00a322bn black hole we inherited means tough decisions are needed across the public sector.\"",
      "The department said it had \"worked with Classics for All and the Classical Association so teachers at the 39 schools on the Latin Excellence Programme can continue to benefit from high quality teacher training, and so that the small number of pupils in those schools who are due to sit their Latin GCSE this summer get the support they need\".",
      "Prof Holmes-Henderson's message was \"nil desperandum\" - do not despair.",
      "She said there were alternative sources of funding for a subject that is still part of the national curriculum and the region can still be at the heart of Latin's revival.",
      "\"Durham University has the only research centre in the world dedicated to classics education research, engaging multiple stakeholders on how we can widen access to the teaching of the subject in our schools and communities.",
      "\"We are pioneers in this region and we want to share the message with as many people as possible that Latin is for everyone and there is funding available to make that happen.\"",

    "summary": "Yo Yo Honey Singh, who transformed Indian hip-hop, has made a comeback after a long battle with drug abuse.",
    "story": [
      "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.",
      "He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.",
      "Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.",
      "The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.",
      "But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.",
      "Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.",
      "Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.",
      "A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.",
      "Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".",
      "He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.",
      "\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.",
      "But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.",
      "Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.",
      "Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"",
      "In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth",
      "\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"",
      "Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.",
      "\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.",
      "Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says.",
      "But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"",
      "So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.",
      "For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.",
      "Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.",
      "Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.",
      "\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.",
      "\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"",
      "Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.",
      "\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"",
      "Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.",
      "\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student.",
      "Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.",
      "No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.",
      "\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently.",

      "In December 2020, on the day that investigative group Bellingcat published its expos\u00e9 on the Navalny poisoning, the man who directed the Russian spy cell sent a message saying: \"We'd be interested in a Bulgarian guy working for Bellingcat Christo Grozev.\"",

      "A message sent by Marsalek to fellow spy Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - demonstrated inside knowledge of Putin's thinking. He wrote: \"Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him.\"",
      "After 2020, the spy cell followed Grozev and Dobrokhotov throughout Europe, spying on them on aeroplanes, in hotels and in private properties.",
      "They discussed kidnapping and even killing the men. There was talk of smuggling Dobrokhotov out of the UK in a small boat from the Norfolk coast, after which he would be taken back to Russia.",
      "Dobrokhotov said it was clear this would have resulted in his death.",
      "It was in January 2023, the month before police arrested members of the cell in the UK, that Dobrokhotov said he was \"warned that I shouldn't leave the country because it can be dangerous\".",
      "He had not realised that he was being followed by the Bulgarian spies, who got so near to him on one flight that they saw the Pin code for his mobile phone.",
      "He thinks the police action sends a signal.",
      "\"Vladimir Putin doesn't understand messages in words, only in actions,\" Dobrokhotov said.",
      "\"So he understands messages like, for example, Ukraine got long-range missiles. That's a message that he can understand.",
      "\"And when his spies are arrested and imprisoned for a big sentence, that's also a message that he can understand.\"",
      "He thinks the use of Bulgarians working in normal jobs shows the limits of Russian espionage after so many professional spies were expelled from the West, but that spy cells like the Bulgarian one are no less dangerous.",
      "Speaking about what motivates him, Dobrokhotov said he wants \"to change Russia\" because he does not want to live in a country that \"kills people just because they're doing journalism or because they are criticising the government\".",
      "He said that \"while we are existing, it is very difficult for Vladimir Putin to feel strength inside the country\" and that \"we will be someone who he will try to eliminate for the rest of his life\".",
      "\"We're in a situation that only some of us will survive, either we or Vladimir Putin and his team.\"",
      "On Friday Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to spy, while Roussev, 47, and Biser Dzhambazov, 43, had previously admitted the same charge. A sixth Bulgarian, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, pled guilty to spying. Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents."

      "There will also be debut Glastonbury performances by Alanis Morisette, Noah Kahan, Gracie Abrams, Lola Young and US rap phenomenon Doechii, who will headline the West Holts stage. Returning favourites include Wolf Alice, Wet Leg, Fatboy Slim, Loyle Carner and Scissor Sisters.",

      "Sidetracked podcast: Annie Mac and Nick Grimshaw react to Glastonbury's headliners",
      "The 1975 reach top of the bill",
      "Cheshire's The 1975 are festival veterans, who have headlined the Reading and Leeds festival three times since 2016 - but this will be their first time at the top of Glastonbury's line-up.",
      "Balancing hooky dance-rock with more experimental forays into electronica and even ambient music, they pepper their lyrics with references to online relationships, chemical dependency and wry, self-aware humour.",
      "Frontman Matty Healy is known for his provocative, and often divisive, actions. On their recent tour, he has been spotted chewing raw steak, berating security guards via Auto-Tune, and passionately kissing fans in the front row.",
      "More seriously, the band are being sued by organisers of a Malaysian festival, which was shut down after Healy kissed one of his bandmates on stage.",
      "The singer said he was protesting at the country's anti-LGBT laws, under which homosexual acts can be punished by 20 years in prison.",
      "\"I feel like they'll be great headliners,\" said BBC 6 Music's Nick Grimshaw, speaking on the Sidetracked podcast.",
      "\"They have great taste and great vision - and they're a band who will think about do a bespoke show.\"",
      "Olivia's rapid rise",
      "Rodrigo is the first Glastonbury headliner to have broken through in the 2020s - and the second-youngest solo headliner of all time, after Billie Eilish, who was 20 when she topped the bill in 2022.",
      "Like Eilish, the 22-year-old will play the Pyramid Stage with just two albums to her name, but she has a solid armoury of fist-pumping pop-punk singalongs (Good 4 U, Brutal, Get Him Back), alongside lighters-aloft ballads like Driver's License and Vampire.",
      "An accomplished live performer, her 2024 Guts tour banked $186m (\u00a3144m) in ticket sales; and she will also headline the BST festival in London's Hyde Park two days before Glastonbury.",
      "Rodrigo last played the festival in 2022, drawing a huge - and noticeably young - crowd to the Other Stage.",
      "During that performance, she brought out Lily Allen to perform the expletive-laden track F You, dedicating it to the US Supreme Court justices who had, a day earlier, ended the constitutional right to abortion in America.",
      "Charli's next Brat summer",
      "Rumours that Rihanna would play the Pyramid Stage turned out to be wishful thinking for the second year running.",
      "But Charli XCX will cement her position as one of the UK's biggest pop stars with her set on the Other Stage.",
      "She returns to the festival after winning five Brit Awards for her deliberately trashy seventh album, Brat.",
      "Playing the Other Stage will release her from the requirement to tone down her set for audiences on BBC One, and indulge in the frenetic, hedonistic club sounds that made her name.",
      "\"The Other Stage is traditionally more of a home for electronic music,\" said Annie Mac on Sidetracked. \"It makes so much sense for her to counteract the Neil Young set on Saturday night.\"",
      "Charli's set also marks the latest step in the star's journey through Glastonbury's smaller stages, starting at the Silver Hayes dance arena in 2014.",
      "\"I was really ill and I forgot to wear a bra on stage, which was good!\" she later told the BBC about her debut..",
      "\"[Radio 1 DJ] Huw Stephens came on during the last song and told me I was singing live on the radio. I lost my voice and it was all a bit crazy, but it was fun.\"",
      "Hopefully she'll avoid the lurgy this summer.",
      "More acts added",
      "Other acts announced for Glastonbury 2025 include Ezra Collective, Jorja Smith, The Libertines, The Maccabees, Franz Ferdinand, Kae Tempest, Beabadoobee, Kneecap and The Prodigy.",

      "They described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"",

      "X added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it was \"not related to Palestine\".",
      "The report, which redacts Pearson's name, stated an officer went to her home and on his recording of the discussion \"clearly states he is there to try to arrange a voluntary attendance interview, to assist the investigation into a complaint of inciting racial hatred\".",
      "Pearson \"began to challenge the officer's actions\", the report adds.",
      "\"She implied that a complaint would be made to the Chief Constable by the Telegraph newspaper.\"",
      "The timing of the visit, early on a Sunday morning, could be judged inconsiderate, but the officer had already made a previous, unanswered visit and was \"diligently trying to conduct his workload\", the report added.",
      "\"Our view is that the officer's behaviour during this interaction was exemplary,\" the report adds.",
      "\"He did not become defensive or challenging and remained calm and polite throughout the interaction.\"",
      "The home visit was reported in the media, the report adds, with much of the reporting referring to as a \"non-crime hate incident\", \"despite a clear explanation [from the officer] that he was investigating an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online.\"",
      "The report praised Essex Police for the way it supported officers and its \"valiant attempt to maintain public confidence\" with its own media releases.",
      "'Totally outrageous'",
      "Pearson did not attend the voluntary police interview and the case was closed when the CPS concluded there was not a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence of stirring up racial hatred under the Public Order Act or the Communications Act.",
      "The report noted that the force, on reviewing the CPS decision, concluded that no crime had been committed.",
      "\"We do not take the view that a crime did not take place,\" the report states, \"rather that there was no realistic prospect of conviction based on the evidence available.\"",
      "The NPCC found Essex Police \"acted reasonably\" in its handling of the complaint but the force should have had a \"more active approach\" in categorising the crime, to avoid ambiguity.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme soon after the case was discontinued, Pearson said she did not think her tweet was wrong, and added: \"I won't censor myself but I will be more watchful in the future.\"",
      "The police visit to her home was not \"standard practice\" and was \"absolutely unacceptable\", she claimed.",

      "Ms Pavlovich first made her allegations public in a Tortoise Media podcast in summer 2024, and was also one of eight women who made claims of assault, abuse and coercion to New York Magazine in January.",
      "In response to that article, Gaiman said: \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"",
      "A spokesman for Palmer has said: \"While Ms Palmer is profoundly disturbed by the allegations that Mr Gaiman has abused several women, at this time her primary concern is, and must remain, the wellbeing of her son and therefore, to guard his privacy, she has no comment on these allegations.\"",
      "Ms Pavlovich filed a lawsuit against Gaimain and Palmer in Wisconsin, and against Palmer in Massachusetts and New York.",
      "As well as insisting her allegations are untrue, Gaiman's lawyers say US courts do not have authority to adjudicate her lawsuit because the alleged assaults happened in New Zealand."

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

    "story": [
      "Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen.",
      "Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.",
      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",
      "What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.",
      "\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.",
      "She makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.",
      "There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt.",
      "\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"",
      "Five things we learned from Meghan's interview ahead of Netflix series",
      "Meghan puts new label on jams and lifestyle range",
      "Meghan Netflix show delayed over LA wildfires",
      "Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.",
      "It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.",
      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",
      "Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.",
      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",
      "She's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"",
      "As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.",
      "In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".",
      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:22:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Women who have quickly lost weight say strangers are now more likely to smile at them or strike up a conversation.",
    "story": [
      "When Branneisha Cooper was overweight, she felt both invisible and like she stood out.",
      "Her friends would get attention when they were out together, while she was overlooked. But she also had a sense that everyone was staring at her, scrutinising her.",
      "Everyday scenarios were daunting: fairground rides (would she fit in the seat?), working out (would it hurt?), clothes shopping (would she find attractive clothing in her size?).",
      "At the end of 2022, Branneisha, now 28 and working in Texas for a major retailer, began using weight-loss injection Mounjaro. She's lost about six stone (38kg).",
      "Things changed quickly. Suddenly, she could exercise without her body getting sore, colleagues made more small talk with her and she felt comfortable going on adventurous dates with her boyfriend. She was go-karting, dancing and going to arcades - activities that previously made her feel self-conscious.",
      "But despite feeling like she had a \"second chance at life\", weight loss was bittersweet.",
      "\"It was almost like I had stepped into a different world overnight,\" Branneisha recalls. \"People were suddenly more friendly, more attentive, and I was given opportunities and respect that didn't exist before.\"",
      "\"That rapid shift was jarring and really opened my eyes to just how deeply size bias is ingrained in our culture,\" she continues. \"Psychologically, it was a lot to process because while I was the same person, the way I was perceived had completely changed.\"",
      "Weight-loss transformations are nothing new. In the 90s and 00s, they filled the pages of tabloid newspapers, sold celebrity diet regimes and inspired popular TV series like The Biggest Loser, You Are What You Eat and Celebrity Fit Club.",
      "But in the 2020s, the advent of weight-loss injections like semaglutide and tirzepatide (marketed under brand names Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro) has meant people can lose huge amounts of weight rapidly, without undergoing invasive surgery. The jabs suppress people's appetites, causing them to feel fuller sooner.",
      "Wegovy has been available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland since September 2023 with strict eligibility criteria, but weight-loss drugs are expected to become more accessible when Mounjaro becomes available through NHS England later this year.",
      "The jabs, which are not suitable for everyone and can have severe side effects, are also available from pharmacies in the UK for people who can't get them prescribed by their GPs.",
      "So other than the physical difference, how does the way you're perceived change when you lose weight quickly and look different to the world?",
      "People who have used the injections have told BBC News that rapid weight loss has caused a massive shift in the way they are treated - by both strangers and loved ones - as well as a change in how they approach their lives.",
      "'Strangers are a lot more chatty'",
      "Branneisha's feeling of sticking out and being overlooked at the same time while overweight is one others can relate to.",
      "When you're overweight, people either avoid eye contact or \"really stare and glare at you\", says Jess Phillips, 29, a primary school teacher from Sittingbourne, Kent.",
      "She previously felt uncomfortable taking flights, travelling on public transport and eating at restaurants. Finding suitable seating worried her, as well as the feeling she was \"taking other people's space\".",
      "People had even shouted \"fat\" at her from cars and at a festival.",
      "A trip in 2023 to Sorrento, on the Italian coast, was a major catalyst for starting weight-loss injections last June.",
      "\"Everyone was staring at me the whole time,\" she says. \"They're just not used to people being that big out there.\"",
      "Since losing weight, Jess has noticed a big difference in how she's treated in public.",
      "\"Strangers seem to be a lot more chatty with me than they ever were before,\" she explains.",
      "She feels \"more invisible in a nice way\", she continues. \"I don't feel like people are looking at me when I go to different places. I feel nicely anonymous... I'm not standing out in any particular way.\"",
      "This is something that Jeannine A Gailey, sociology professor at Texas Christian University, explored in her 2014 book The Hyper(in)visible Fat Woman.",
      "\"My argument is that those who are marginalised, including fat people, become hyper-visible and hyper-invisible\", meaning they're sometimes ignored and sometimes made into a \"spectacle\", she tells the BBC.",
      "Amy Toon, 34, a content creator from Solihull, felt this way. Before starting on the drugs, she shopped online \"because of the overwhelming fear of people looking at me\", she says. \"I just didn't want to leave the house.\"",
      "Since losing weight, \"people are a lot more smiley and just make eye contact,\" she says. \"I never had that before. It's really strange and it's also really sad at the same time.\"",
      "Society has preconceptions about how overweight people are expected to behave, and treats them accordingly, says Caleb Luna, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara specialising in fat studies.",
      "\"Fat people are expected to hide and shrink ourselves and not be proud,\" says Prof Luna.",
      "Weight isn't a protected characteristic in the UK or in most other parts of the world, meaning it isn't illegal to discriminate based on size, except if the person's weight is classed as a disability.",
      "Academics say that anti-fat bias can have significant implications, from how people are perceived in job interviews to how doctors interact with them. People make \"all kinds of personality assumptions\" about other people based on their body size, according to Prof Luna.",
      "\"I don't understand why there's this rage that some people seem to feel upon looking at someone who's overweight,\" says Alix Harvey, a 35-year-old marine biologist from Plymouth who's lost around three stone (20kg) after starting weight-loss injections last year. \"It's socially acceptable to hate fat people.\"",
      "'People see the drugs as cheating'",
      "Weight-loss drugs have helped people like Branneisha, Jess, Amy and Alix lose weight - but they're not right for everyone. Some in the healthcare industry have concerns about the wrong people getting hold of the jabs - including those who are already a healthy weight or have a history of eating disorders.",
      "Common side effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide include diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Rarer side effects include acute gallstone disease and pancreatitis, and the NHS warns that there is also a risk of hypoglycaemia, which happens when your blood sugar level drops too low.",
      "Jonathan Pinkney, professor of endocrinology and diabetes at the University of Plymouth, says while there are \"great expectations and hope around the drugs\", trials show people \"do tend to relapse\" after they stop taking them, meaning the weight loss isn't sustained.",
      "Alix says this worries her. \"Am I going to be treated differently again? Because I like the way I'm currently being treated.\"",
      "Some people who take the medication say there's stigma attached to using the drugs to lose weight, too, which Alix says puts some people off taking the injections.",
      "\"I didn't expect the hatred,\" she says, noting that some people see the use of weight-loss injections as \"cheating\" and a \"socially unacceptable\" way to lose weight.",
      "\"A lot of people see it as the lazy way out,\" Amy says, referring to comments about weight-loss drugs left on her social media videos.",
      "For sustained weight loss, the injections need to be used as part of a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise.",
      "\"People think that it's a magic wand then it's not,\" Amy says. \"It doesn't just melt the fat away.\"",
      "\"Even if you injected yourself once a week and a pound a week just evaporated from your body, what would that matter?\" Alix says. \"Why is that cheating?\"",
      "\"You basically can't win,\" she says, referring to the stigma attached to both being overweight and using injections to lose weight.",
      "'The larger me deserved that same attention and love'",
      "People who've lost weight using the jabs tell the BBC their self-confidence has massively improved. Many say they feel much happier to take trains and planes. Some say they now wear brighter colours and tighter clothes. Others say they're more vocal sharing their opinions at work.",
      "Amy says she now feels comfortable taking her children swimming, while Jess says she's been able to book her first-ever ski trip, something she'd never thought was possible before.",
      "\"I actually think it must be annoying how confident I am at the moment,\" Jess laughs.",
      "But many of the women we spoke to were left feeling sad for their previous selves, or frustrated at the unfairness of their past treatment.",
      "\"It's so sad that your weight can define you,\" Amy says. \"I haven't changed at all as a person. The only thing that has changed my appearance.\"",
      "Branneisha echoes these thoughts.",
      "\"It makes me sad when I have experiences that are different now because the larger me deserved that same attention and love,\" Branneisha says. \"Being smaller now makes me sad for my former self because people looked at me differently.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 01:37:16 GMT",
    "summary": "The at-home light therapy treatment is increasingly being seen as a must-have skincare accessory.",
    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",

      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.",
      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",
      "\"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.",

    "story": [
      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",
      "The 'Time Lords' racing to tackle the threat of GPS jamming",
      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\".",
      "Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to \"screen\" for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules.",
      "Others are sold to \"monitor prostate health\" or identify \"potential prostate issues early\".",
      "One of the home tests ordered by the BBC also arrived in packaging and with instructions clearly marked \"for professional use only\".",
      "Charity wants testing of men at high risk of prostate cancer",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",
      "I'm more grateful for each day - Sir Chris Hoy",
      "For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use.",
      "A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette.",
      "Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l.",
      "A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l.",
      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",
      "\"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\"",
      "Online reviews appear to bear that out.",
      "In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.",
      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",
      "\"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\"",
      "'Dangerously outdated'",
      "Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\".",
      "\"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity.",
      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.",
      "\"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer,\" he added."

    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.",
      "The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries.",
      "Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.",
      "However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a \"profound tragedy\".",
      "By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.",
      "The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.",
      "If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.",
      "In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.",
      "However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.",
      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",
      "The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.",
      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",
      "\"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\" she added.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.",
      "Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.",
      "However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected.",

      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",

      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",

      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",

      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",

    "summary": "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis of death certificate data carried out for BBC News.",
    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

      "Six takeaways from Keir Starmer's 'plan for change'",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his pledges?",
      "In a system designed to give employers the tools to deal with bad performance, McFadden, who will appear on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, is expected to promise a new \"mutually agreed exits\" process, that will incentivise civil servants performing below their requirements to leave their jobs.",
      "Meanwhile, under-performing senior civil servants will be put on development plans, with the possibility of being sacked if there is no improvement within six months.",
      "McFadden is also expected to say that the most senior officials will have their pay linked to performance outcomes.",
      "\"The state is not match-fit to rise to the moment our country faces,\" he explained, adding the government's \"plan for the civil service is one where every official is high performing and focused on delivery\".",
      "\"To do this we must ensure that we go further to ensure those brilliant people who can deliver are incentivised and rewarded, and those who can't are able to move on.",
      "\"The changes announced today will result in a more focused and productive civil service and more efficient delivery of the change working people need.\"",
      "After a bumpy start in government for Labour, ministers clearly believe the civil service needs to be not just leaner, but more agile.",
      "With the party still struggling in the polls, McFadden has recognised too many people do not believe the system works for them, so he wants to redirect resources from the backrooms to frontline services.",
      "He said he will not use what he calls \"crude headcount targets\" as a means of measuring civil service efficiency - but does point out staff numbers have risen by 15,000 in two years.",
      "McFadden is also expected to pledge to make more public services digitised and employ more staff in relevant roles.",
      "But Dave Penman, general secretary of the civil servants union FDA, said: \"If the government is serious about transforming public services they must set out what the substance of reform looks like, not just the retreading of failed ideas and narratives.\"",
      "He added meaningful reform \"must put substance before headlines\", and that if McFadden wanted civil servants to focus on delivery - while government departments simultaneously cut resources - \"ministers need to set realistic priorities\".",
      "\"[The] government should get on with the difficult job of setting those priorities rather than announcing a new performance management process for civil servants every other month,\" Mr Penman explained.",

      "Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UK's total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the unit's request.",
      "The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.",
      "Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time.",
      "On another occasion, it cited concerns about \"negative press\" when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates.",

      "Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was \"the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body\".",

      "The CRU said it was legitimately discussing \"negative press\" or \"media attention\" when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure.",
      "It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020.",
      "What is Freedom of Information?",
      "FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure.",
      "Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret.",
      "The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies.",
      "Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called \"applicant-blind principle\" when responding to FOI requests.",
      "The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the act regularly in their work.",
      "The CRU, however, recorded whether requesters were members of the media and their organisation.",
      "It said it was not subject to the applicant-blind principle because it was only an advisor, but would stop the practice from March 2025.",
      "It also said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests or if and when it had favoured the disclosure of information that was in the spirit of FOI laws.",
      "Akiko Hart, director of human rights advocacy group Liberty, said: \"It's incredibly concerning that police have continually tried to downplay, hide and rescind information that is in the public interest.",
      "\"At a time when public trust in police is at an all-time low, transparency in their actions has never been more important. The police have a statutory duty to provide information held by them when requested by the public and journalists, and must not try to circumvent this.\"",
      "In 2022, an independent review was conducted into a separate government unit that advised other departments on their FOI responses. The review found poor practice and recommended the unit's replacement.",
      "The so-called Clearing House was part of the Cabinet Office. It was alleged to have profiled journalists and treated their FOI requests inappropriately.",
      "The review rejected its approach of circulating the names of requesters who had asked the same questions of several departments \u2013 a so-called round robin requester \u2013 to help it coordinate similar responses.",
      "The government's response was to say it would pilot a new system \"immediately\", but the BBC found the NPCC's CRU still matched names to round robin requests 18 months after the Clearing House recommendations were published.",
      "Claire Miller, former data journalism editor and an expert in FOI, said further investigation was needed as the CRU did not seem to be \"operating within the spirit of the FOI Act.\"",
      "\"It does not seem to have taken on board the criticisms of and recommendations for the Clearing House, which perhaps it should have done,\" she said.",
      "The NPCC declined to give an interview but instead issued a statement.",
      "Chief Constable Rob Carden, its digital, data and technology lead, said: \"Policing is firmly committed to being open and transparent. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is one important way we remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"We always strive to share as much as we can in our responses with a presumption to disclose.  However, there are circumstances where information cannot be disclosed and needs to be redacted, and on occasions withheld, to ensure police can continue to use tactics to protect the public or to prevent sensitive information being exploited by criminals to cause harm.  These instances are strictly sanctioned with clear parameters, as set out in legislation.\"",
      "He said complaints about how forces applied the FOI Act could be referred to the Information Commisioner's Office (ICO).",
      "A spokeperson for the ICO said the data watchdog had used its powers \"proactively numerous times\" in the last two years to ensure police forces were compliant.",
      "They said: \"We will continue to take action when necessary, including keeping under review whether any central co-ordination in this sector is having a negative impact on compliance with the law when we examine the complaints that come to us.\"",
      "Author Martin Rosenbaum, a former FOI lead for the BBC, said the performance of police forces when it came to handling FOI requests had \"seriously deteriorated\".",
      "\"The ICO has taken enforcement action against 15 police forces because of their FOI failings, which is more than one in three forces nationally, and is the worst record of any part of the public sector,\" he said.",
      "Surrey and South Yorkshire police were among the forces issued with enforcement notices in 2024 for failing to answer requests within the 20 days set out by law.",
      "The ICO spokesperson said there was nothing to stop public bodies like the police seeking advice from a central body on how to correctly interpret the law, but it must not stop them meeting deadlines for responses or any other FOI requirements.",

      "An application to shrink the geographical area where Melton Mowbray pork pies can be produced has been rejected.",
      "The pies have special protected geographical status, which means only producers using the traditional recipe and in the vicinity of the Melton Mowbray can use the Leicestershire town's name.",
      "The pastry can be produced in the town of Melton Mowbray and its surrounding region, including Nottingham to the north and Northampton to the south, but The Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (MMPPA) applied for this area to be reduced.",
      "However, the request was refused by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) in decision notice published on Wednesday.",
      "The pie's status is called Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).",
      "Matthew O'Callaghan, chairman of the MMPPA, said when the group originally applied for the protection - awarded in 2008 - they \"had historical evidence as to where the boundaries should go\".",
      "He said: \"In the south, the boundary was originally the road between Leicester and Stamford.\"",
      "But Defra suggested it be extended because a company in Wellingborough, which had been making the pork pies for decades, objected as it would have been outside the area, Mr O'Callaghan said.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan added: \"We agreed the area would be almost doubled so as to go down to the south to include this producer in Wellingborough.\"",
      "However, he said the producer - Saxby's - had closed and no pork pies had been made in that area for at least 10 years.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan said the association therefore thought it was reasonable to ask Defra to amend the region to the original proposal.",
      "\"It would not have affected anybody currently producing Melton Mowbray pork pies,\" he added.",
      "He said the association was \"disappointed\" the application was rejected \"because we think what people want when they buy a Melton Mowbray pork pie is a pie tied to a historic area\".",
      "Explaining the area they wanted the protection reduced to, he said it was between \"the Leicester to Stamford road - the A47 [to the south], the Great North Road the A1 [to the east], the River Trent in the north, including Nottingham, and then to the west, the River Soar\".",
      "Defra's notice rejecting the application said: \"The proposed amendment would reduce the geographical production area and exclude certain producers from using the PGI designation.",
      "\"This would directly affect market access and impose new trade restrictions, which is not permitted under the regulation.\"",
      "It added: \"The applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the quality, reputation, or characteristics of the product are now exclusive to the proposed smaller area.\"",
      "The association has been advised if it opts to appeal against the decision, the deadline is 2 April.",

    "summary": "The announcement comes with a number of measures aimed at transitioning from oil and gas to renewable energy.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has launched a consultation on plans to replace the windfall tax on the profits of energy companies when it comes to an end in 2030.",
      "The Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced in May 2022 after companies recorded skyrocketing profits due to a sharp rise in energy prices.",
      "It was increased in the most recent UK government budget last year and means oil and gas producers are paying a headline tax rate of 78%.",
      "The consultation seeks views on a new tax which would be triggered either when energy prices or profits are exceptionally high.",
      "The department for energy security and net zero said it would work to develop a plan that would deliver a \"fair return for the nation during times of unusually high prices\".",
      "And it pledged to consult on a \"new regime\" for the industry in the North Sea, confirming new licences for oil and gas fields would not be approved.",
      "Government admits new oil field approved unlawfully",
      "Oil firm blames windfall tax for North Sea pull-out",
      "That comes after the UK government admitted plans for the Rosebank oil field off Shetland had been approved unlawfully after the decision was challenged in court by environmental campaigners.",
      "The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"The North Sea will be at the heart of Britain's energy future. For decades, its workers, businesses and communities have helped power our country and our world.",
      "\"Oil and gas production will continue to play an important role and, as the world embraces the drive to clean energy, the North Sea can power our plan for change and clean energy future in the decades ahead.\"",
      "Oil and gas companies had posted record profits after wholesale prices spiked amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The EPL was introduced by the previous Conservative government, which set the rate at 25% and put it in place until 2025.",
      "It was later increased to 35% by then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt and would run until at least 2029.",
      "Current chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that had been extended until at least 2030 and increased again by 3% in October 2024.",
      "The latest rise prompted the US-based firm Apache to announce it would end its North Sea operations by 2029.",
      "The company described the financial impact as \"onerous,\" adding continuing to operate in the area would be \"uneconomic\".",
      "The price per barrel of oil has since fallen significantly.",
      "Trade association Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) previously warned the tax increase would stifle investment in the sector.",
      "Its chief executive, David Whitehouse, welcomed the news.",
      "He said: \"Today's consultations, on both the critical role of the North Sea in the energy transition and how the taxation regime will respond to unusually high oil and gas prices, will help to begin to give certainty to investors and create a stable investment environment for years to come.\"",
      "Alongside oil and gas production, the government said it wanted to ensure the North Sea would become a \"world-leading example\" for offshore clean energy.",
      "It said it was \"committed\" to working with the sector, trade unions and other organisations on a \"phased transition\" for the oil and gas industry.",
      "However, energy minister Michael Shanks was unable to guarantee new discoveries of oil wells near current licenced sites would not be exploited.",
      "The industry has been calling for flexibility if oil wells spread into nearby areas which are not licenced while current permits remain in place.",
      "Shanks said he would \"not be drawn\" on individual applications.",
      "He said: \"We've been really clear, we're clear in our manifesto, we're clear now in this consultation, it says in black and white no new licences to explore new fields.\"",
      "'Future-proofed jobs'",
      "The department for energy security and net zero said \"tens of thousands\" of more jobs could created in offshore renewables.",
      "It said the denial of future oil and gas exploration licences was required to keep global warming to the target of 1.5C, but said it would \"engage\" with the sector on how to manage existing fields for the remainder of their lifespan.",
      "Mel Evans, climate team leader at Greenpeace UK, said: \"Our over-reliance on volatile and expensive fossil fuels is the reason our energy bills have remained so high in recent years.",
      "\"With yet more uncertain times ahead, this is a step worth celebrating from the government.",
      "\"The only way forward for a secure future means ending our reliance on oil and gas. The government clearly recognises that creating a renewable energy system can provide this country and its energy workers with economic opportunities and stable, future-proofed jobs.\"",
      "Tessa Khan, executive director of environmental campaign group Uplift, said the plans were \"long overdue\".",
      "She said: \"The government is right to draw a line under new licensing, which won't slow the decline in jobs or boost the UK's energy supply.",
      "\"This government now needs to make sure the transition to clean energy delivers for those workers and communities that are currently tied to the declining oil and gas industry.",
      "\"That means creating more good, secure jobs and new industries like wind manufacturing and decommissioning in the places that need them.\"",
      "The Unite union said it welcomed the government's plans, but warned it must be more than a \"listening exercise\".",
      "They said any future proposals must be backed up by the creation of \"large numbers of highly skilled, well paid jobs\".",
      "General secretary Sharon Graham said further investment in green technology was needed to create jobs before new licences for oil and gas fields were put on hold.",
      "She said: \"We urgently need investment in wind manufacturing and other green technologies to create the well paid, highly skilled jobs which are regularly promised but rarely delivered.",
      "\"Until that happens, we need to resist any calls that amount to offshoring our carbon responsibilities for the sake of virtue signalling.",

    "summary": "President Macron has aired the idea that France's deterrence force could be used to defend of other European countries.",
    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",

      "\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"",
      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",
      "\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland.",
      "\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.",
      "\"I don't know what I've done to make you viscerally hate me that much.\"",
      "Since politics she has performed a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival and spent time talking about politics on various TV shows and podcasts.",
      "There does not appear to be any second guessing about her decision to stand down though, as she enjoys a walk with her dog in the new documentary.",
      "\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.  I've done my bit,\" she says.",
      "\"Doing something normal on a Tuesday, going for a walk with my wee best pal, is much better than running around Westminster.\"",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",

      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "\"Validation that this works is really exciting for this project,\" says the firm's chief science officer, Prof Beth Shapiro.",
      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",

    "summary": "MPs have discovered banking services went offline for more than 800 hours over a two year period.",
    "story": [
      "Nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years, figures published by a group of MPs show.",
      "The Treasury Committee - which has been investigating the impact of banking IT failures - compelled Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to provide the data.",
      "It does not include the Barclays outage in January or the Lloyds outage last week - two incidents which occurred on payday for many people, and left customers unable to pay their staff and bills.",
      "The report finds Barclays could now face compensation payments of \u00a312.5m.",
      "\"For families and individuals living pay cheque to pay cheque, losing access to banking services on payday can be a terrifying experience,\" said Dame Meg Hillier, the committee's chair.",
      "\"The fact there has been enough outages to fill a whole month within the last two years shows customers' frustrations are completely valid,\" she added.",
      "Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, she said she hoped putting the data in the public domain would encourage banks and the regulator to see if there was any more that could be done to reduce the disruption.",
      "The Treasury said it was \"grateful to see the Committee's findings\".",
      "A spokesperson told the BBC that the Treasury is \"working with the financial authorities to regulate third party suppliers, as well as considering whether the banks are doing all they can to provide the level of service customers expect\".",
      "But Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT,  says the findings \"once again highlights that the traditional banking sector hasn't kept pace with the investment needed to modernise its infrastructure\".",
      "The findings come as hundreds of Santander customers reported issues affecting access to the bank's app and physical banking services on Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"We're aware that customers are currently unable to access some of our services,\" the company has told customers visiting its website's service status dashboard.",
      "\"We're very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing, and we are working hard to fix the problem as soon as possible.\"",
      "Barclays compensation",
      "The Treasury Committee data looked at IT failures which affected millions of customers between January 2023 and February this year. They found there had been 158 incidents.",
      "While the data does not include the Barclays outage in January, which left one family without a home, the bank told the committee that over half of online payments over the course of the first day of the outage did not work due to \"severe degradation\" of their system's performance.",
      "That family was Emily McAllister, from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, and her children. Ms McAllister and her 19-year-old daughter Keira, who is autistic and has Down's syndrome, had to spend two nights with her sister and one night at a local hotel after their house move was delayed due to the Barclays outage.",
      "Speaking after the committee released its report, Emily told BBC News that she remained in discussions with Barclays over compensation.",
      "She said: \"It should have felt like a fresh start and a new chapter, and it was completely tainted, and will always feel like that, but it is starting to feel like home.\"",
      "Barclays confirmed to the committee that it expects to pay between \u00a35m and \u00a37.5m in compensation to customers for \"inconvenience or distress\".",
      "When taking into account all the information shared by Barclays, this means the bank could pay out up to \u00a312.5m in compensation due to outages over the last two years.",
      "The second highest amount paid out by a firm in that same period is \u00a3350,000 from the Bank of Ireland.",

      "\"For customers, this isn't just frustrating, it can be devastating. When legacy banking infrastructure keeps crashing, customer trust crashes with it.\"",
      "In his submission to the committee, Vim Maru - the chief executive of Barclays UK - said the January outage was caused by a software problem with their system, and the incident was not due to a cyber-attack \"or any other malicious activity\".",
      "\"We continue to work through the impact to ensure no customer or client will be out of pocket as a result of the incident.\"",

    "story": [
      "US prosecutors have charged 12 Chinese nationals for being part of an alleged hacking scheme, which sold data of US-based dissidents to the Chinese government.",
      "The \"state-sponsored\" operation also targeted government agencies including the Treasury, according to the Justice Department (DOJ).",
      "Hackers also allegedly targeted an American religious organisation, and a newspaper in Hong Kong, the statement added.",
      "China has not responded to these specific allegations, but have strongly denied other accusations in the past.",
      "In December, the Treasury Department reported a \"major\" breach by Chinese -sponsored hackers, saying they were able to access employee workstations and some unclassified documents.",
      "At that time, China denied any involvement, calling the accusation \"baseless\" and saying it \"consistently opposes all forms of hacking\".",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been \"defanged.\"",
      "The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked.",
      "\"In view of Microsoft's potentially important role in securing Sam Altman's re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAI's commercial policy,\" the watchdog said.",

      "\"Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK's merger control regime,\" CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn.",

      "\"This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech \u2013 just like they did the last one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",
      "But in a set of instructions to the CMA issued in February, the government said it should prioritise \"pro-growth and pro-investment interventions\".",
      "The same month the UK sided with the US in not signing an agreement on AI at a summit in Paris.",

      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) helped remove a record almost 300,000 web pages last year, including more artificial intelligence (AI) generated images than ever as the number of these types of images have increased almost fivefold.",
      "\"The content is horrific, it shouldn't ever have been created in the first place,\" said Mabel, a former police officer.",
      "\"You don't ever become immune to it, because at the end of the day these are all child victims, it's abhorrent.\"",

      "\"There's not many jobs where you go to work in the morning and do good all day, and also irritate really bad people, so I get the best of both worlds,\" said Mabel, originally from north Wales.",
      "\"When I remove an image, I'm physically stopping the bad people accessing those images.",
      "\"I have children and grandchildren and I just want to make the internet a safer place for them.",
      "\"On a wider scale, we collaborate with law enforcement agencies all around the world so they can form an investigation and maybe put gangs to bay.\"",
      "The IWF is one of only three organisations in the world licensed to actively search for child abuse content online and last year helped take down 291,270 web pages which can contain thousands of image and videos.",
      "The foundation, based in Cambridge, also said it helped take down almost five times more AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery this year than last, rising to 245 compared to 51 in 2023.",
      "The UK government last month announced four new laws to tackle images made with AI.",
      "The content is not easy for Tamsin McNally and her 30-strong team to see but she knows their work helps protect children.",
      "\"We make a difference and that's why I do it,\" the team leader said.",
      "\"On Monday morning I walked into the hotline and we had over 2,000 reports from members of the public stating that they had stumbled across this kind of imagery. We get hundreds of reports every single day.",
      "\"I really hope everyone sees this is a problem and everybody does their bit to stop it happening in the first place.",
      "\"I wish my job didn't exist but as long as there are spaces online there will be the need for jobs like mine, sadly.",
      "\"When I tell people what I do quite often people can't believe this job exists in the first place. Then secondly they say, why would you want to do that?\"",
      "Many tech firm moderators have ongoing legal claims as employees claimed the work had destroyed their mental health - but the foundation said its duty of care was \"gold standard\".",
      "Analysts at the charity have mandatory monthly counselling, weekly team meetings and regular wellbeing support.",
      "\"There's those formal things, but also informally - we've got a pool table, a huge connect four, jigsaw corner - I'm an avid jigsaw fan, where we can take a break if needed,\" added Mabel.",
      "\"All these things combined help to keep us all here.\"",
      "The IWF has strict guidelines making sure personal phones are not allowed in the office or that any work, including emails, are not taken out.",
      "Despite applying to work there, Manon - again, not her real name - was not sure if it was a job she could do.",
      "\"I don't even like watching horror films, so I was completely unsure whether I'd be able to do the job,\" said Manon, who is in her early twenties and from south Wales.",

      "\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"",
      "A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".",

      "\"I think some people are still underneath the garbage,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Many of them eked out a living by washing and selling whatever discarded items they found that still had value - anything from fishing nets to plastic bottles, glass jars and the components of old electronic devices.",
      "A blame-game erupted after the fatal collapse, with Kampala's city council and central government accusing each other of negligence, while some of the dead still languished under tonnes of rubbish without the dignity of a burial.",
      "When government tractors did eventually dig up Kezia's body, there were injuries to the 21-year-old's face.",
      "It was horrifying for his friend to see him enveloped by stinking, rotting waste.",
      "\"We're not safe here. Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.",
      "Unable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.",
      "Youth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.",
      "\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"",
      "The collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.",
      "The houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.",
      "Compensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.",
      "Officials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).",
      "Some argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.",
      "\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.",
      "The Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.",
      "As Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.",
      "On the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still.",
      "Birds of prey can be seen flying overhead.",
      "The city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.",
      "But the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.",
      "\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.",
      "\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"",
      "Yet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.",
      "Had that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.",
      "So, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?",
      "The answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.",
      "Ultimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.",
      "The KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.",
      "\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.",
      "\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"",
      "There is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.",
      "It did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".",
      "A month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.",
      "James Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.",
      "At present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.",
      "But they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.",
      "\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.",

      "The statement said Hamas \"must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel any more\" and that the four countries \"support the central role for the Palestinian Authority and the implementation of its reform agenda\".",
      "Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes since the start of hostilities. Israel began military operations after Hamas's October 2023 attack which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage.",
      "Gaza has suffered vast destruction with a huge humanitarian impact. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and much infrastructure across the strip has been levelled by air strikes.",

      "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman died of natural causes about a week after his wife Betsy Arakawa, who died after contracting a rare virus, a New Mexico medical investigator has said.",
      "Hackman, 95, died at his Santa Fe home from coronary artery disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease a contributing factor.",
      "Ms Arakawa, 65, died in the same house from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Her cause of death was listed as natural.",
      "Authorities believe she passed away about seven days before her husband, to whom she had been married for more than 30 years. During his career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.",
      "It is likely that Ms Arakawa died first on 11 February, Dr Heather Jarrell of the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office told a news conference on Friday.",
      "She said it was \"reasonable to conclude\" that Hackman had died on 18 February.",
      "Ms Arakawa's last known movements and correspondence were on 11 February, when she was seen going to a grocery store, a CVS pharmacy and a pet store, before returning home in the early evening.",
      "Given that Hackman was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", said Dr Jarrell.",

      "At the news conference, New Mexico Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps emphasised that hantavirus infections were extremely rare.",
      "HPS is transmitted through contact with rodent droppings, urine or saliva, often when contaminated dust is inhaled.",

      "The remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition.",
      "Hackman's body was in a sideroom next to the kitchen, with a walking cane and a pair of sunglasses nearby, according to a search warrant affidavit.",
      "Ms Arakawa's body was in the bathroom, with scattered pills close to her.",

      "Initial investigations found no signs of forced entry or foul play at the couple's $3.8m (\u00a33m) home. Tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative, and no significant gas leaks were detected.",
      "Hackman is survived by three adult children from his previous marriage.",
      "Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.",
      "He won best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.",
      "A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.",
      "He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.",

      "It was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.",
      "There are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.",
      "Now Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.",
      "Gurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.",
      "About 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.",
      "US Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"",
      "\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"",
      "Opposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.",
      "Gurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"",
      "An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.",
      "But on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.",
      "\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "In the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police.",
      "Gurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.",
      "\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "While the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.",
      "\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.",
      "\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"",
      "Gupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.",
      "He said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.",
      "Then he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.",
      "On 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.",
      "Gurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.",
      "From Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.",
      "A dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.",
      "\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"",
      "Each group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.",
      "At night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.",
      "\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.",
      "\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"",
      "When they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.",
      "Gurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.",
      "\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.",
      "Once in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "During the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.",
      "If they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime.",
      "This is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.",
      "Instead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.",
      "In their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.",

    "summary": "Justin Trudeau's party was headed for near-certain defeat. That is until Trump's tariffs came, upending the face of Canadian politics.",
    "story": [
      "If you had asked Canadians a few months ago who would win the country's next general election, most would have predicted a decisive victory for the Conservative Party.",
      "That outcome does not look so certain now.",
      "In the wake of US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has surged in the polls, shrinking the double-digit lead their Conservative rivals had held steadily since mid-2023.",
      "The dramatic change in the country's political landscape reflects how Trump's tariffs and his repeated calls to make Canada \"the 51st state\" have fundamentally altered Canadian voters' priorities.",
      "Trump's rhetoric has \"pushed away all of the other issues\" that were top of mind for Canadians before his inauguration on 20 January, notes Luc Turgeon, a political science professor at the University of Ottawa.",
      "It has even managed to revive the once deeply unpopular Trudeau, whose approval rate has climbed by 12 points since December. The prime minister, of course, will not be in power for much longer, having announced his resignation at the start of the year.",
      "On Sunday, his Liberals will declare the results of the leadership contest to determine who takes over a party running a precarious minority government. The new leader will have two immediate decisions to make: how to respond to Trump's threats, and when to call a general election. The answer to the first dilemma will surely influence the second.",
      "Who is in the running to replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?",
      "A federal election must be held on or before 20 October, but could be called as early as this week.",
      "Polls indicate that many Canadians still want a change at the top. But what that change would look like - a Liberal government under new leadership, or a complete shift to the Conservatives - is now anyone's guess, says Greg Lyle, president of the Toronto-based Innovative Research Group, which has been polling Canadians on their shifting attitudes.",
      "\"Up until now, it was a blowout for the Conservatives,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "That is because the centre-right party led by Pierre Poilievre, has been effective in its messaging on issues that have occupied the Canadian psyche for the last few years: the rising cost of living, housing unaffordability, crime and a strained healthcare system.",
      "Poilievre successfully tied these societal problems to what he labelled Trudeau's \"disastrous\" policies, and promised a return to \"common sense politics\".",
      "But with Trudeau's resignation, and Trump's threats to Canada's economic security and even its sovereignty, that messaging has become stale, Mr Lyle says. His polling suggests the majority of the country is now most afraid of Trump's presidency and the impact it will have on Canada.",
      "Trump's 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the US, some of which have been paused until 2 April, could be devastating for Canada's economy, which sends three-quarters of all its products to the US. Officials have predicted up to a million job losses as a result, and Canada could head into a recession if the tax on goods persists.",
      "Trudeau left no doubt how seriously he is taking the threat, when he told reporters this week that Trump's stated reason for the US tariffs - the flow of fentanyl across the border - was bogus and unjustified.",
      "\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" the prime minister warned.",
      "\"In many ways, it's an all encompassing, fundamental issue about the survival of the country,\" Prof Turgeon tells the BBC. Who is best placed to stand up for Canada against Trump has therefore become the key question in the forthcoming election.",
      "The Conservatives are still ahead in the polls, with the latest averages suggesting 40% of voters back them. The Liberals' fortunes, meanwhile, have been revived, with their support climbing to slightly over 30% - up 10 points from January.",
      "Liberals have attempted to highlight similarities between the Conservative leader and Republican president. At last week's leadership debate, candidates referred to Poilievre as \"our little version of Trump here at home\" and said he was looking to \"imitate\" the US president. A Liberal Party attack ad juxtaposed clips of the two using similar phrases such as \"fake news\" and \"radical left\".",
      "There are clear differences, however, between the two politicians, in terms of style and substance. And Trump himself has downplayed any parallels, telling British magazine The Spectator in a recent interview that Poilievre is \"not Maga enough\".",
      "Still, polls suggest a slipping of Conservative support. A recent poll by national pollster Angus Reid indicates Canadians believe Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is better equipped to deal with Trump on issues of tariffs and trade than Poilievre.",
      "The former central banker for both Canada and England is touting his experience dealing with economic crises, including the 2008 financial crash and Brexit.",
      "And the shift in the political mood has forced Conservatives to recalculate their messaging.",
      "If the election is called soon, the campaign will take place at a moment when Trump's threats have inspired a fierce patriotism among Canadians. Many are boycotting American goods at their local grocery stores or even cancelling trips to the US.",
      "Prof Turgeon says this \"rallying around the flag\" has become a key theme of Canadian politics.",
      "The Conservatives have shifted away from their \"Canada is Broken\" slogan, which Mr Lyle says risked coming across as \"anti-patriotic\", to \"Canada First\".",
      "Conservatives have also redirected their attacks towards Carney. Before Trump's tariffs, they ran ads saying he is \"just like Justin\" in an attempt to tie him to Trudeau. But in recent weeks, the Conservatives have started digging into Carney's loyalty to Canada.",
      "Specifically, they have questioned whether he had a role in moving the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management - a Canadian investment company - from Toronto to New York when he served as its chair.",
      "Carney has responded that he had left the firm by the time that decision was made, but company documents reported on by public broadcaster CBC show the board approved the move in October 2024, when Carney was still at Brookfield.",
      "The move, and Carney's equivocation of his involvement with it, was criticised by the editorial board of Canada's national newspaper the Globe and Mail, which wrote on Thursday that Carney must be transparent with Canadians.",
      "More broadly, the paper wrote: \"Every party leader must understand that Canada is entering a years-long period of uncertainty. The next prime minister will have to call on the trust of Canadians to lead the country where it needs to head but may not want to go.\"",
      "Given the anxiety reverberating among Canadians, Mr Lyle says that any ambiguity about Carney's loyalty to the country could yet be damaging for him and the Liberals.",
      "Whenever the election comes, and whoever wins, one thing is certain: Trump will continue to influence and reshape Canadian politics just as he has in the United States.",

    "summary": "Stars like Charli XCX have made see-through outfits all the rage at big events, but not everyone's a fan.",
    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's girlfriend Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", she argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "summary": "Yo Yo Honey Singh, who transformed Indian hip-hop, has made a comeback after a long battle with drug abuse.",
    "story": [
      "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.",
      "He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.",
      "Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.",
      "The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.",
      "But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.",
      "Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.",
      "Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.",
      "A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.",
      "Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".",
      "He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.",
      "\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.",
      "But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.",
      "Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.",
      "Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"",
      "In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth",
      "\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"",
      "Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.",
      "\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.",
      "Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says.",
      "But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"",
      "So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.",
      "For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.",
      "Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.",
      "Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.",
      "\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.",
      "\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"",
      "Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.",
      "\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"",
      "Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.",
      "\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student.",
      "Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.",
      "No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.",
      "\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently.",

    "story": [
      "Subscribers to Joshuanette Francis's YouTube channel \u2013 set up to document her journey after being diagnosed with osteoarthritis at just 24 \u2013 did not see the tears.",
      "Neither were they privy to the days when she tackled the most acute personal struggles, alone behind closed doors.",
      "After being told she could lose the ability to walk by age 40, Joshuanette was determined to embrace life, hiking every nature trail in her native Antigua and visiting each one of the Caribbean island's touted 365 beaches while she still could.",
      "Consistently upbeat and smiling in her videos and in public, her private tears were amplified when she lost her job as a restaurant supervisor - because of her condition, she says - followed by her mortgage and her dream of building her own home.",
      "Six years on, the young mother's sunny persona is the one she uses to fight her public battle: championing the rights of others living with a disability in a country where inequity is rife and crucial resources are in short supply.",
      "She channels her energy into a pioneering non-profit she founded in 2023, Good Humans 268, which strives for a brighter future for people with physical challenges.",
      "\"Arthritis has changed my life so much, I can only imagine what it must be like for someone with a major disability,\" Joshuanette tells the BBC.",
      "Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, typically affects older people, but can strike at any age.",
      "\"I couldn't believe it when I was diagnosed. My biggest fear was, what happens to life now?\" Joshuanette says.",
      "Good Humans' far-reaching work ranges from pushing for the establishment of an equal rights tribunal to preside over purported discriminatory practices, to a recycling programme that in turn employs local residents with disabilities.",
      "The latter has already been implemented in more than 80 local schools, diverting about a million bottles and cans from the national dump site. Eight people have been hired to sort and process, and sometimes repurpose, the waste.",
      "Good Humans has also launched a nationwide educational programme to encourage more residents to recycle, something Kelisha Pigott was employed to assist with.",
      "She says working with the organisation has been life-changing.",
      "\"There are a lot of people with disabilities out there who have no one to turn to. Joshuanette has moulded me to believe in myself more. It's because of her that I took the chance to apply for university and got in,\" Kelisha enthuses.",
      "She hopes her online degree in tourism management will help her eventually merge her small travel company with Good Humans to create additional job opportunities.",
      "\"Change starts with us. I was amazed to see how much plastic we diverted from landfill in a short space of time; imagine if everyone did it,\" she says.",
      "There have been some smaller triumphs too. Like the case of the 10-year-old girl who for several years couldn't use the toilet at school unassisted because of the lack of wheelchair-friendly facilities. That indignity went largely overlooked until Joshuanette took it on as a personal endeavour, leading to the creation of an accessible bathroom.",
      "\"We must shift the way we do things. People with disabilities must be able to do the same things everyone else can,\" Joshuanette says passionately. \"I'm so excited by what I know Good Humans can achieve.\"",
      "Plans include rolling out the recycling scheme to private households and ultimately creating a purpose-built centre to consolidate the group's diverse work.",
      "Still, she's aware of the challenges ahead. Even a stroll around the capital, St John's, is fraught with hazards for many with an impairment, thanks to omnipresent open gutters, crudely covered drains and cracked paving.",
      "\"Accessibility is a serious concern,\" says Bernard Warner, head of the country's disability association. \"For a start, there's a lack of access to assistive devices to help people live more meaningfully.\"",
      "Both Bernard's group and Good Humans have been calling for legislation passed in 2017, which seeks to protect the rights of those with disabilities, to be enforced. An equal rights tribunal was a key part of the act, but has never been created.",
      "\"There's a lot of discrimination; people are treated with indifference or turned away from employment opportunities,\" Bernard says. \"And due to poverty, most don't have money to hire lawyers.\"",
      "Bernard lost his right leg when his motorbike was struck by a drunk driver in 1996. Despite a lengthy court case, which ruled in his favour, he has never received compensation.",
      "\"After years of torment, I now rally for a better society,\" he explains. \"We have to alter our mindset with how we view people with disabilities. We've been leaving them out for too long. Even now, I see high-rise buildings going up with no disability access,\" he adds.",
      "Kelly Hedges, principal of the Victory Centre for children with special needs, agrees. Her school currently has 27 students aged five to 18.",
      "\"The challenge is, when students leave us as young adults, where do they go? People are still wary about hiring people with special needs or disabilities. Unless they have personal connections or can go to work with a parent, they generally just stay home,\" she says.",
      "The Victory Centre is among the schools to have joined Good Humans' recycling scheme.",
      "\"As Good Humans becomes bigger and needs more staff, hopefully our children can segue into positions there, become contributing members of society and live more independently,\" Kelly adds.",
      "Joshuanette believes that mental health should be a key focus of disability awareness. Despite her largely positive outlook, she admits depression struck again recently when she turned 30 and still could not afford her own home.",
      "She continues to battle for compensation against the company she says fired her unfairly.",
      "\"Fighting is exhausting,\" she says. \"But change will only happen when more people talk about disability and demand change.\"",

    "summary": "Across the country, Canadians are defiant in boycotting American goods and travel even as Trump promises another temporary reprieve.",
    "story": [
      "Not long after the US imposed their tariffs on Canada, a local neighbourhood pub in Toronto began removing all American products off their menu.",
      "That means nachos, wings - and of course, beer - must all be made now with local Canadian ingredients, or wherever not possible, non-US products from Europe or Mexico.",
      "For Leah Russell, manager at Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, the boycott was a no-brainer. She adds that it is \"pretty set in stone,\" even if the tariffs themselves are not.",
      "\"I'm glad that we're getting rid of American products and supporting local businesses,\" Ms Russell told the BBC on Thursday. \"I think it's an important thing to do.\"",
      "This defiant stance in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats against Canada has been unfolding across the northern country, even as it braces for economic blowback that it could ultimately do little to avoid in the event of a full-blown trade war.",
      "Just ask actor Jeff Douglas, once the face of Molson Canadian Beer's \"I Am Canadian\" advertisements, who has filmed and posted a light-hearted, but deeply-patriotic video on Youtube this week addressing Trump's \"51st state\" rhetoric.",
      "\"We're not the 51st anything,\" declares Mr Douglas in the video, which has since gone viral in Canada.",
      "Some of the backlash has been more symbolic, like one Montreal caf\u00e9 changing the Americano on their menu to a \"Canadiano\" - a small gesture that the owners say is meant to display unity and support for their community and country.",
      "Even the CBC, the country's public broadcaster, is feeling the full force of this wave of patriotism, after it dared run a programme asking Canadians what they think about Canada becoming \"the 51st state\", as Trump has suggested many times.",
      "The show sparked intense backlash and accusations of \"treason,\" \"sedition\" and even \"betrayal\".",
      "Although Trump has since lifted some of the tariffs imposed this week and put others on pause until 2 April, many Canadians say the damage has already been done.",
      "After Thursday's reversal, foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that Canada has been shown \"too much disrespect by the Trump administration at this point, calling us a 51st state, calling our prime minister 'governor.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Doug Ford, who is the leader of Canada's most populous province, did not back down from his plan to slap export tariffs on electricity that Canada supplies some US states. The 25% surcharge will affect up to 1.5 million American homes.",
      "\"I feel terrible for the American people because it's not the American people, and it's not even elected officials, it's one person,\" he told a local radio show on Thursday in reference to Trump.",
      "\"He's coming after his closest friends, closest allies in the world and it's going to absolutely devastate both economies,\" Ford said.",
      "Canadians support their country's reciprocal actions, saying they should remain in place until US tariffs are completely off the table.",
      "\"You go to bed every night and don't have any idea where you stand,\" said Andrew, a shopper at a Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) store in Toronto, which has stopped stocking US-made alcoholic drinks, like bourbon from Kentucky. Trump says he will delay the tariffs, \"but what does that mean?\" he asks.",
      "\"Let's keep [American-made drinks] off the shelves until we know what things are going to be from day to day.\"",
      "The tariffs have been met with deep anxiety in Canada, whose majority of exports are sold to companies and clients in the US. Officials predict up to a million job losses if a 25% across the board levy went ahead, while economists warn that a recession is imminent if they persist.",
      "The potential impact is devastating enough that the Canadian government has announced it will bring in relief measures, similar to those implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help impacted individuals and businesses.",
      "Even with the tariffs being scaled back temporarily, the uncertainty alone is hurting both American and Canadian economies, says Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto.",
      "\"The most sensitive thing to uncertainty is business investment,\" Prof Gillezeau says, adding that firms are \"not going to want to spend a dime anywhere\" until they have some clarity.",
      "Analysts suggest the mere whiff of a trade war is likely costing Canadian companies hundreds of thousands of dollars as they try to navigate through these changes, and are likely delaying deals and disrupting trade due to the confusion.",
      "That trepidation is also seen in the stock market, which had erased virtually all its gains since Trump won the presidency in November.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said that tariffs are a response to Mexico and Canada's role in the fentanyl crisis, which has killed over 250,000 American since 2018.",
      "While only a small portion of the drug originates from Canada, press secretary Karen Leavitt said that even those numbers are significant for \"families in this country who have lost loved ones to this deadly poison\".  Even small amounts of fentanyl can kill large number of people, she added.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the tariffs, suggesting they align with Trump's stated desire to see Canada become \"the 51st state.\"",
      "\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" Trudeau told media in Ottawa Thursday.",
      "Prof Gillezeau notes that it is an especially deep wound from a neighbour whom Canada had long considered its closest friend and ally.",
      "The US and Canada have fought wars together, have boasted about having the longest \"undefended\" shared border in the world and have even engaged in joint security missions in the Arctic to defend each other's sovereignty.",
      "\"We've been allies for 100 years,\" he says, adding that many Canadians are likely upset not just with how the US has been treating Canada, but also other allies like Ukraine.",
      "\"We're a decent, honourable people, and we stand by our allies,\" Prof Gillezeau says. \"I think that's what is driving the real depth of the discontent we see.\"",
      "The Canadian boycotts are already having material impact. Canadian outlet Global News has reported that leisure travel bookings to the US have plunged 40% year over year, citing data from Flight Centre Canada. That decline has also been observed in land border crossings between British Columbia and Washington State.",
      "Before the tariffs, the US was the number one international travel destination for Canadians, who have spent $20.5bn (\u00a315.89bn) into the American tourism economy in 2024 alone.",
      "Asked if this trend will hold, Prof Gillezeau says Canadians ideally want relations to go back to normal with their neighbour. But in absence of that, the consensus in the country is that \"Canada needs to find friends elsewhere\".",

    "summary": "Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa were found dead in their home last week in a gated community in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "New Mexico officials have announced the cause of death for actor\u00a0Gene Hackman\u00a0and his wife Betsy Arakawa, a week after they were found dead\u00a0at their home in Santa Fe. Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, and Arakawa died several days before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said Friday.",
      "Investigators had been trying to determine a cause of death for the couple since they died in their home last month.",
      "How did Gene Hackman die?",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their home in a gated community in Santa Fe on Feb. 26, but appear to have died earlier in the month.",
      "Hackman likely died around Feb. 18, when the last activity was detected on his pacemaker, Jarrell said during a Friday news conference.",
      "An autopsy determined that Hackman died of heart disease and also suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. He tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "\"He was in a very poor state of health,\" Jarrell said. \"He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death.\"",
      "Arakawa likely died first, with Feb. 11 being the last time that she was known to be alive, Jarrell said. People with hantavirus infections can initially feel flu-like symptoms for roughly three to six days and then start to have fluid in and around their lungs.",
      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24-48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said. \"It's not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened.\"",
      "Asked if Hackman was aware of his wife's passing, Jarrell said: \"That question's difficult to answer, but I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.\"",
      "There was no food in Hackman's stomach, meaning he had not eaten recently before he died, Jarrell said. She didn't find evidence of dehydration.",
      "Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said there was no indication of a caretaker at the home.",
      "What is hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are found worldwide, carried by rodents and transmitted from animals to humans, Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department, told reporters Friday. The hantavirus found in New Mexico is found throughout the state, primarily in deer mice but in other rodents too, Phipps said.",
      "The hantavirus strain in the Southwest has a mortality rate of about 38%-50%, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be contracted from exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "The various strains in the U.S. aren't transmissible from person to person.",
      "A hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and heart or lung failure, Jarrell said.",
      "The illness is rare, with the state Health Department reporting there were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024. In the last 50 years, officials have identified 136 infections in New Mexico residents, including five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease \u2014 42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal,\" Phipps said. Most infections occur around the home or workplace, she said.",
      "State health investigators conducted a risk assessment of the couple's property Wednesday, Phipps said. While the main residence itself was deemed a low risk for hantavirus exposure, signs of rodent entry were found on other structures on the property, she said.",
      "Investigation into Hackman's and Arakawa's deaths",
      "Mendoza said last Friday there were no apparent signs of foul play in the deaths. The initial findings from the autopsies found no external trauma on either of the bodies, Mendoza said.",
      "Hackman's body was found in a mudroom near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses nearby, according to an affidavit for a search warrant.",
      "The sheriff's office found medication for blood pressure and thyroid issues as well as Tylenol during a search of the home, according to an inventory of the search filed in court. Some pills were scattered on a bathroom countertop near where Arakawa's body was found, according to the affidavit. Mendoza wouldn't say who was prescribed the medication, citing patient privacy laws.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate near Arakawa, while their two other dogs were found alive. Phipps said the dog may have died from dehydration or starvation. Dogs don't get sick from hantavirus, she said.",
      "Investigators also collected two cellphones from the home and a monthly planner, Mendoza said. No surveillance cameras had been found at the home, according to the sheriff.",
      "\"I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family,\" Mendoza said.",
      "The sheriff's office said Tuesday that the company that provides natural gas service for the home made no significant findings after looking for gas leaks and carbon monoxide, the colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal by depriving people from getting enough oxygen. Mendoza said last Friday that both bodies tested negative for carbon monoxide.",
      "Hackman, who won Oscars for his performances in 1971's \"The French Connection\" and the 1992 Western \"Unforgiven,\" was honored at Sunday's Academy Awards in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He received two Oscars, but more importantly, he won the hearts of film lovers all over the world,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman at the awards ceremony. \"Gene always said, 'I don't think about legacy. I just hope people remember me as someone who tried to do good work.' So I think I speak for us all when I say, Gene, you'll be remembered for that and for so much more.\"",

      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death.",
      "Here's what we know from officials.",
      "How did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said. She had an email conversation with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home, he said.",
      "Based on that information, Jarrell said it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "As of March 7, investigators were awaiting autopsy results for Zinna. Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "There was no known communication from Arakawa indicating she was feeling ill, Mendoza said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",
      "Hackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.",
      "Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",
      "He won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"",

    "story": [
      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",
      "As of mid-2024, U.S. residents owed at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to data from the American Hospital Association. Health care bills have for years been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies.",

      "\"Health centers like this are pillars in Philadelphia's neighborhoods,\" Dr. Rich Snyder with Independent Blue Cross said.",
      "The kiosk is strategically placed here because research from the American Heart Association says Latinos and Hispanics are 40% less likely to receive CPR from a bystander.",
      "\"So being able to remove barriers to access and education and bring the kiosk to where patients are already coming is really going to be beneficial in helping us to improve bystander response rates, which will improve cardiac arrest survival rates,\" Jeffrey Salvatore with the American Heart Association said.",

      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",
      "More changes could be coming soon to the communications officials who remain. A current HHS official said staff within the team were asked to provide explanations of their \"roles and responsibilities\" by noon on Tuesday.",

      "Measles outbreaks across North America are threatening the region's status of having officially eliminated the virus, officials from the Pan-American Health Organization warned, potentially undoing a hard-fought victory to wipe out community transmission.",
      "The U.N. agency pointed to a 4.5-times increase in reported measles cases this year across North and South America, compared to the same period last year.",
      "More than 97% of cases across the region so far this year have been in the U.S. or Canada. Cases have also been reported in Mexico and Argentina.",
      "\"The risk of outbreaks has increased, given the increase in measles cases worldwide, coupled with factors such as low coverage of the first and second doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine,\" PAHO, the World Health Organization's regional office for the Americas, said in a report published last week.",
      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",
      "The last large outbreak of the virus in the U.S. was in Illinois last year. It was largely confined to migrant shelters in Chicago.",
      "CDC officials warned in 2019 that the country was at risk of losing measles elimination status, after outbreaks spread for several months around undervaccinated communities in the New York area. However, the U.S. ultimately kept its status.",

      "Authorities have been grappling with a growing measles outbreak linked to unvaccinated communities across northwest Texas. At least 158 cases have been confirmed, state officials said Monday.",
      "A child died last month from the outbreak. The CDC's death certificates data suggest the most recent reported U.S. death from measles before that was in 2019.",

      "Harrison's plasma contained a rare antibody known as anti-D. It's used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman's immune system attacks her fetus' red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh-negative blood type and her baby's is Rh-positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors. They help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, at the age of 81.",
      "\"He did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\" Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",

      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",
      "How James Harrison's blood might have acquired its unique feature",

      "\"After the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you're only really alive because people donated blood,\" Jarrod Mellowship said. \"The day he turned 18, he started donating.\"",
      "The application of anti-D in fighting hemolytic disease of the newborn wasn't discovered until the 1960s.",

      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare. \"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",

      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",

      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",

    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/auto-tariffs-should-you-buy-a-car-now-2025-prices/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 14:55:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

    "summary": "More restrictive trade and immigration policies under the Trump administration could mean higher prices for Americans, Morgan Stanley analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration are likely to result in higher prices for American consumers and businesses, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",
      "Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.",
      "\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.",
      "Persistent inflation could deter the Fed from moving to nudge down interest rates and lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, experts note. About 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the central bak to cut rates at its next meeting on March 19.",

      "The U.S. Department of Education could be headed for some major changes, with President Trump expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of dissolving the agency.",
      "Although the timing of such a move is unclear, reports that is in the works are already raising questions for millions of parents, students and taxpayers about the future of the Education Department and how the services it provides will be handled if the agency is dismantled.",
      "What does the Department of Education do?",
      "In 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Department of Education. The agency's key functions include:",
      "Disbursing billions in student loans each yearOperating the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which allows students to apply for loans, grants and other college aidProviding funding to help poor and disabled students enrolled in K-12 schoolsEnsuring equal access to education through its Office of Civil RightsOperating the Pell grant program, which provides qualifying low- and middle-income students with up to $7,400 per year to attend collegeFunding public charter schoolsOverseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agenciesCollecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",

      "Funding public charter schools",
      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",
      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",
      "What do educators and Democrats say?",
      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",
      "Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",
      "The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency.",
      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions\u2014from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.\"",
      "She added, \"The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed.\"",

      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada.

      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",

      "Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions.",
      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",
      "The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it.",
      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.",

      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",
      "\"When mass layoffs occur, it often leaves remaining staff feeling uneasy and uncertain. The likelihood that many more workers leave voluntarily is high,\" Andrew Challenger, workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",

The jobless rate is forecast to remain steady at 4%. Some analysts expect layoffs ordered by DOGE to show up in the report in the coming weeks or months.",
      "Other sectors besides the federal government also laid off workers last month, Challenger, Gray found. Retailers cut almost 39,000 jobs, while technology companies cut 14,554 jobs in February, its data shows.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",

But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",
      "Shares of U.S. automakers jumped on Wednesday afternoon, with Ford Motor rising 47 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.58. GM shares gained about 7%, while Stellantis climbed 9.2%.",

      "Businesses large and small are bracing for the impact of the Trump administration's new tariffs on U.S. imports from\u00a0Mexico, Canada and China\u00a0\u2014 and preparing to pass on the pain to consumers.",

      "The new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, plus a move to tack an additional 10% levy on to an existing 10% tariff on Chinese imports, took effect Tuesday. Those costs are borne largely by U.S. importers, usually leading to price hikes for shoppers.",
      "While Barry said the tariffs will lead to price increases, she didn't specify how big they would be.",
      "\"I think it is fair to say... that tariffs at this level will result in price increases. I think it is very difficult to say given the backdrop that we're in, exactly precisely how big that is,\" Barry added later in the call in response to a question from an analyst.",
      "A Walmart executive told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0in February that it would not be \"immune\" to the impact of such levies.",
      "And Target CEO Brian Cornell this week told CNBC that because the discount retailer relies heavily on produce from Mexico, consumers can expect to see higher prices on fruits and vegetables almost immediately.",
      "\"If there's a 25% tariff, those prices will go up,\" Cornell said.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0this week urged the Trump administration to reconsider the sweeping new tariffs, saying they force businesses to choose between hiking prices or risk going out of business.",
      "\"American families and businesses are struggling with high costs. It's one of the top issues that they want policymakers to address,\" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.",
      "\"We also want to work together to keep costs down, but tariffs will only raise prices and increase the economic pain being felt by everyday Americans across the country. We urge reconsideration of this policy and a swift end to these tariffs,\" he added.",
      "Franco Salerno, who owns Darianna Bridal and Tuxedo in Warrington, Pennsylvania, told the Chamber of Commerce the company is printing new price tags to reflect the increased costs dress designers expect to incur and pass along to Darianna's, due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Dress designers are already notifying us that they are raising prices to cover any tariffs,\" Salerno told the trade group.",
      "The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), a trade organization representing retailers, also called on President Trump to reconsider his tariff policy.",
      "\"The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hanson, RILA's senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. \"Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy. Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:03:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has swung wildly since President Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Here's what to know about your 401(k).",
    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",

      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

      "More than 1.1 million people with public pensions \u2014 teachers, firefighters, police officers and the like \u2014 have recently received retroactive benefits due to the Social Security Fairness Act, the Social Security Administration said on Tuesday.",
      "The SSA said it is continuing to pay the retroactive benefits to eligible Social Security beneficiaries, whose monthly payments will increase beginning in April, reflecting March's benefit.",

      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, the benefits hike is retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",

      "The tariffs went into effect at 12:01 a.m., hours before President Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress of his second term.",
      "The U.S. also imposed 10% tariffs on imports from China on top of those already in place, bringing them to 20%.",
      "The tariffs come as more U.S. households are showing signs of economic strain, with retailers such as Target and Walmart recently warning that inflation-weary consumers are cutting back on spending. Mr. Trump's tariffs could push up prices on everything from avocados imported from Mexico to gasoline prices, potentially undermining the president's pledge to eradicate inflation.",

      "China responded immediately, announcing it would put additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef.

He had said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances and Florida orange juice.",

      "Did Canada have tariffs on U.S. products before?",
      "Canada had imposed some limited tariffs on U.S. products before 2025, and vice versa. Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which was signed by President Trump in 2020, the countries had negotiated a complex set of rules aimed at promoting trade.",
      "One of the biggest changes in the USMCA pact was providing American farmers greater access to Canada's dairy markets. That included a plan\u00a0eliminating existing Canadian-imposed tariffs on some U.S. dairy products over a number of years, including whey and margarine.",
      "The U.S. has also previously imposed tariffs on some Canadian products, including duties placed by the first Trump administration on imported softwood lumber. Under the Biden administration, the tariffs on Canadian lumber rose from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",

      "No newcomer, Huang set up shop in Cambodia 20 years ago, capitalizing on the tax breaks and lower wages in the country, while still running factories in China. But when the trade war began in 2018, he moved all operations to Cambodia.",
      "He told CBS News that 60% of his business is in the U.S. market, with his goods going to familiar retailers including Walmart and Costco.",
      "Huang said incoming orders had multiplied since Mr. Trump announced his new tariffs on China, the latest round of which could take effect on Tuesday.",
      "An escalating U.S.-China trade war",
      "Mr. Trump imposed a 10% blanket\u00a0tariff on Chinese imports in early February, drawing retaliatory measures by China of 15% on imported U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars. Last week, Mr. Trump threatened China with another 10% duty on all imports, which would take effect Tuesday, resulting in a total 20% blanket tariff on all Chinse goods imported to the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump has imposed the tariffs on China, he says, for Beijing's failure to stem the flow of deadly fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Already, Beijing is planning more countermeasures.",
      "\"China is studying and formulating relevant countermeasures in response to the U.S. threat of imposing an additional 10% tariff on Chinese products under the pretext of fentanyl,\" the Global Times newspaper, largely considered a mouthpiece for the ruling Communist Party, reported on Monday, citing an anonymous source.",
      "\"The countermeasures will likely include both tariffs and a series of non-tariff measures, and U.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,\" the newspaper said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment and will update with any response.",
      "Unless and until the escalating trade war sees Mr. Trump turn his favored economic weapon of tariffs on Cambodia, Huang told CBS News more Chinese companies will likely become his neighbors in the country.",
      "\"Of course,\" the businessman said. \"Many people tell me they need factory building, need to move immediately, because they think taxes are going up.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-a-crypto-strategic-reserve-trump-bitcoin/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "summary": "Investors wary of President Trump's plan to add tariffs of 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a negative GDP forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "State Department staff were taken aback this week by a department directive instructing embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality monitoring data.",
      "CBS News has reviewed the message that was sent to staff on March 4, which says \"currently there is no anticipated date for real-time data to be available.\" Embassy staff and their families relied on the reports to alert them to poor air quality days.",
      "\"I was shocked by the announcement,\" said a current staffer, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about their job, and who said the decision doesn't make much sense as the existing infrastructure to monitor air quality is already in place and operational. \"I don't see any purpose in turning off this data, it doesn't make any sense,\" said another department employee.",
      "A State Department spokesman told CBS News in a statement that the air quality monitors are running, but the effort to transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates is no longer happening \"due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network.\" When asked what it costs to operate the program, the State Department did not provide an answer.",
      "\"The cost to maintain these systems is trivial,\" said Rick Duke, who served as the deputy special envoy for climate at the State Department until January and believes this isn't about saving money as much as it's driven by misplaced anti-climate ideology in the Trump administration. \"These monitors aren't even about climate,\" said Duke, \"Why take away health information from embassy staff and the public?\"",
      "Air monitoring at U.S. embassies began informally in 2008 when a single monitor was placed at the embassy in Beijing, China. The results were posted hourly on Twitter, informing the public about levels of air pollution in the city. The account called\u00a0AirBeijing became internet-famous in 2010 when it tweeted that the air on Nov. 11 was \"Crazy Bad\" when the machine registered dangerously high levels of air pollution.",
      "The purpose behind the monitoring was to inform U.S. citizens living in the region about the state of the city's air, but the Chinese public quickly picked up the information and began demanding their government address the toxic pollution that local officials often downplayed.",
      "The State Department expanded air monitoring at other embassies around the world, installing 78 monitors elsewhere, and made the data available on AirNow.gov. A 2022 scientific study found that the embassy program was highly successful in reducing air pollutants, \"resulting in substantial decreases in the premature mortality risk faced by the over 300 million people living in cities home to a US embassy monitor.\"",
      "But now that the program is terminated, the webpage for embassy data only produces an error message. The last available reading in Beijing was posted on March 4, the day the agency stopped transmitting data.",
      "Current State Department staff told CBS News that access to air quality data is key when weighing overseas assignments, especially for those who must move their entire family and children to places with unhealthy air, or in locations where air monitoring by local governments is unreliable or non-existent.",
      "\"Robbing employees of the information they need for the health decisions of their children is immoral,\" said a current staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the air data continues to be collected and \"will be made available when there is a secure and reliable way to transmit it.\" They said the department is \"evaluating other transmission options.\"",
      "The spokesperson also said the air quality monitoring equipment \"is only one of a number of tools the Department uses to ensure the health and safety of our staff.\"",

It's a practice that was first implemented on a large-scale by the Obama administration, in an attempt to discourage families from crossing the southern border illegally.",

      "The U.S. government has long faced legal, humanitarian and operational challenges when processing migrant parents and children who are in the country without legal permission. In 2015, for example, a federal judge ruled that the government should generally not hold migrant children for longer than 20 days, dramatically limiting family detention in the immigration context.",
      "The revival of family detention is the latest step taken by the Trump administration to expand ICE's capabilities to arrest, detain and deport migrants who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Officials at ICE have been under tremendous pressure from top Trump administration officials to ramp up arrests and deportations.",

      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",

Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",

      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening.

      "Sunland Park, New Mexico \u2014 On a recent afternoon, CBS News accompanied U.S. Border Patrol agent Claudio Herrera along this rugged stretch of the U.S. southern border.",
      "Herrera said the area, located within Border Patrol's sprawling El Paso sector, has long been a hotspot for the illicit movement of people and drugs. But the situation there has changed markedly in recent weeks.",
      "\"The activity is very slow,\" Herrera said along the New Mexico border, which is patrolled by El Paso sector agents. \"There's multiple factors attached to why we have seen a significant drop in apprehensions recently.\"",
      "He continued: \"One of them, of course, is consequences,\" referring to deportations of those entering the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "President Trump has moved aggressively to carry out the large-scale crackdown on illegal immigration he promised on the campaign trail. Since his inauguration, illegal border crossings, which were on the decline during the last year of the Biden administration, have plunged even further.",
      "In February, Border Patrol recorded roughly 8,500 apprehensions of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, the lowest level in at least 25 years, according to government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "Asked if the dramatic change stems from new policies out of Washington, D.C., Herrera said, \"It has a lot to do with that.\"",
      "Citing muscular presidential powers, Mr. Trump has effectively shut down the American asylum system, allowing U.S. border agents to swiftly expel migrants under the legal premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\" He has also deployed thousands of additional troops to the U.S. southern border and tasked the military with carrying out deportations.",
      "During that recent ride-along with Border Patrol in the El Paso sector, CBS News cameras captured a heavily fortified U.S. border, spotting Border Patrol agents, soldiers, vehicles and barriers. But there were no migrants in sight.",
      "Mr. Trump's crackdown was also on full display when CBS News traveled to the other side of the border.",
      "At a shelter in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Eduardo Medina and his wife Joanna Cortes described how they had brought their three children to northern Mexico last year after fleeing the high levels of crime and violence in the southern state of Michoac\u00e1n.",
      "The young family said they had been staying in a small room for six months, hoping to get an appointment to enter the U.S. with the government's permission. But the app the Biden administration set up to distribute entry appointments to migrants in Mexico, known as CBP One, was quickly terminated after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "While her dream involved opening a restaurant in the U.S. and enrolling her children in American schools, Cortes said her family is thinking of \"returning to the land where we were born\" due to the suspension of the CBP One system.",
      "\"What else are we going to do?\" she said in Spanish, adding later that she did not want her family to cross into the U.S. illegally.",
      "Still, returning to Michoac\u00e1n is a devastating prospect for Cortes.",
      "Breaking down in tears, Cortes said she and her husband \"sold everything\" to ensure their children could have a \"different life\" away from the \"hell\" in Michoac\u00e1n.",
      "But that dream, she said, has \"ended.\"",
      "Asked what he would tell families like the ones interviewed by CBS News in Mexico, Walter Slosar, the top Border Patrol official in the El Paso sector, said U.S. immigration laws must be enforced.",
      "\"We're going to make sure that we're securing the border, and we're going to do so unapologetically,\" Slosar said. \"I understand that people ended up in these areas, but we did not bring those individuals to this specific area.\"",

    "summary": "Asked about NATO Article 5 commitment, Trump says U.S. \"not going to defend\" allies that fail to meet his spending requirements.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",
      "\"Do you think they're going to come and protect us? Hmm. They're supposed to. I'm not so sure,\" Mr. Trump said as he addressed reporters at the Oval Office.",
      "He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",
      "More than 7,000 members of the U.S. armed forces were killed during that same period, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.",
      "President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.",
      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, also announced a plan this week to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in extra spending on defense and infrastructure should he take office.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came at the end of a week in which his administration ruffled European feathers by appearing to question the contributions of America's NATO allies.",
      "In pointed comments on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron said France and the U.S. were \"loyal and faithful allies,\" and that France had \"respect and friendship\" for the United States.",
      "\"I think we're entitled to expect the same,\" Macron said",
      "Vance irks U.K. and France with remark he claims wasn't aimed at them",

      "Vance said the potential economic deal, which the White House has pushed Kyiv hard to sign, \"is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\"",
      "Those comments sparked outrage from politicians in France and the U.K. \u2014 the only two countries that have thus far said they might send troops to help maintain peace under a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "While Vance later appeared to walk his remarks back on social media, saying that both countries had, \"fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years\" and that he did not \"even mention the UK or France\" in the interview, the diplomatic damage was done.",

Politico first reported the timing on Harris' self-imposed deadline to decide whether to run. Candidates have until early March 2026 to file paperwork ahead of the June 2, 2026, primary.",
      "Another source familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News that she is \"seriously considering\" a run for governor. A gubernatorial bid would likely mean she would not run for president in 2028, which she is also considering.",
      "The field to replace Newsom, who has been governor since 2019, is expected to be sizable, but Harris' entry into the race could dissuade other Democrats from launching bids of their own.",

      "Harris, 60, has largely stayed out of the spotlight since her November loss to President Trump.

      "For Kelly Shaw, unemployment is unfamiliar territory. \"I've never been in this situation before. I've never been fired,\" Shaw said, suddenly quiet, while seated at her kitchen table in Northern Virginia.",
      "Nearly three years ago, the longtime senior intelligence analyst left the Navy, after being recruited by the nation's top cyber defense agency and rising up through the ranks. Eventually, Shaw helped establish a congressionally mandated program designed to continuously monitor and detect cyber breaches of the nation's power grid, pipelines and water system \u2013 installing sensors across critical infrastructure designed to detect insider threats and foreign adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.",
      "\"It was all about the information we can get within networks to find the bad guys \u2013 any indicators of compromise, evidence of the adversary, moving through a network and attempting to do bad things. That's what we did,\" Shaw said, pausing. \"Well, that's what some will still do.\"",
      "The former manager for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's \"CyberSentry\" program, Shaw was also among the 130 probationary CISA workers mass fired in the \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" during the holiday weekend last month.",
      "That weekend, the form letter termination notices arrived for over 4% of CISA's workforce, telling them they were \"not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\" Among them were the nation's threat hunters, incident response team members, disabled veterans and employees who'd already signed onto the federal government's deferred resignation program.",
      "Others were former private sector workers who left lucrative jobs making seven-figure salaries to join the federal government and officials recruited into DHS' innovative hiring program \u2014 dubbed the \"Cyber Talent Management System\" \u2014 and analysts with top secret security clearances.",
      "\"I waited literally 13 months from the moment I got my offer letter to the moment I started this job,\" said former cybersecurity specialist Paula Davis, recounting her arduous security clearance process. Before her termination letter arrived in her email inbox, Davis said she was required to send agency leadership an email justifying her position, but she never received a response.",
      "Davis spent her days analyzing code for state and local municipalities, identifying risks or abnormalities across the nation's aging critical infrastructure.",
      "\"We're being targeted daily, hourly and every single minute,\" Davis said, citing suspected cybercriminals' attempts to infiltrate water systems and the power grid. She called her role fighting those intrusions her \"dream job.\"",
      "\"I didn't take an oath to the Constitution just to start getting a paycheck,\" Davis said, \"Or else I would have just gone back into the private sector. I would have stayed at a big corporation.\"",
      "Since last month, the rapid-fire firings have shaken lawmakers and high-ranking officials, leaving many current and former employees dumbfounded. CBS News has spoken with over a dozen current and former CISA employees, including several who were granted anonymity in interviews, due to fear of reprisal.",
      "\"These are the people that are the first line of defense in responding to incidents like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, and if we go even further back, SolarWinds,\" said one former CISA employee, referencing a string of foreign cyber espionage campaigns dating back to President Trump's first administration.",
      "\"These are elite hunters that look across critical infrastructure and government networks to figure out if these bad actors are active in these networks,\" the former employee continued. \"The people who find how deeply they've penetrated and 'how do we get them out of there?'\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned at a hearing Wednesday that lawmakers are hearing that \"significant cuts are coming for the remaining workforce\" at CISA.",
      "\"That kind of talent, you just don't find it every day,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"You have to convince many of those individuals to leave lucrative private sector employment and come and accept the public mission of securing our cyber security systems and protecting our country.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn, last month, Former CISA Director Jen Easterly wrote that the agency had hired over 2,000 new employees during her more than three-year tenure.",
      "Since 2021, CISA's \"strategic recruitment\" program \u2013 congressionally mandated and more than seven years in the making \u2013 has competed with the private sector to attract and retain world-class talent to execute a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. Cyber Talent Management System or \"CTMS\" hires were by law employees with \"measurable or observable\" attributes including \"knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors.\"",
      "A former human resources employee for CISA who was among those fired told CBS News that before his termination, he was tasked with compiling a list of probationary employees, and among them were over 100 CTMS staff members.",
      "\"Everybody in CTMS is automatically in a three-year probation, so it's easier to get rid of them,\" the former HR employee told CBS News. \"Close to 99% of our CTMS employees were probationary.\"",
      "\"You are extinguishing the best and brightest in one fell swoop,\" a current CISA employee said.",
      "A CISA spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the agency had 142 employees as part of its talent recruitment program, but did not disclose the number of employees fired.",
      "Shaw was among the first recruits to the \"CTMS\" program, entering with 12 years of government service, two master degrees in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, plus at least nine different specialized cyber certifications.",
      "\"I had such confidence,\" Shaw said. \"With all my prior experience. I just completed my doctorate in May of last year. So I thought I was well positioned to stay at CISA\u2026.But when I saw that executive order come through about probationary employees, I kind of panicked.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration is \"making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"To me, knowing how sleek and how well organized of an engine we had at CISA, that's a lie,\" Shaw said of the effort\u00a0to slash federal spending by eliminating federal workers. \"I don't know who else is going to be cut loose from our nation's cyber defense organizations. But I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. This should be the last place that we should be cutting this expertise.\"",
      "Along with firing scores of probationary workers, over the last month, CISA has put on leave at least a dozen employees who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections, part of a wider trend of dismantling U.S. efforts to fight foreign meddling in elections.",
      "But concerns stemming from cybersecurity workforce cuts extend beyond the CISA workforce.",
      "Former NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce raised \"grave concerns\" that aggressive threats to cuts of U.S. government probationary employees will have a \"devastating impact on the cybersecurity and our national security.\"",
      "\"At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,\" Joyce said. \"Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.\"",
      "To help assist fired employers at her former agency, Easterly has created a matching website to connect former CISA alumni and prospective employers.",
      "For his part, Thompson has started a hotline to encourage fired employees at the Department of Homeland Security and its components to share their stories.",
      "After the Trump administration tapped the Office of Personnel Management to fire federal employees en masse, a federal judge temporarily blocked it, citing OPM's lack of authority to fire employees at other agencies.

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 07:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "War heroes and historic military events are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the PentAgon works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, the AP reports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher.",
      "One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public, said the purge could delete as many as 100,000 images or posts in total, when considering social media pages and other websites that are also being culled for DEI content. The official said it's not clear if the database has been finalized.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks following President Trump's executive order ending those programs across the federal government.",
      "",
      "The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months - such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.",
      "But a review of the database also underscores the confusion that has swirled among agencies about what to remove following Mr. Trump's order.",
      "In some cases, photos seemed to be flagged for removal simply because their file included the word \"gay,\" including service members with that last name and an image of the B-29 aircraft Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.",
      "Several photos of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in California were marked for deletion, apparently because a local engineer in the photo had the last name Gay. And a photo of Army Corps biologists was on the list, seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish - including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.",
      "In addition, some photos of the Tuskegee Airmen, the nation's first Black military pilots who served in a segregated WWII unit, were listed on the database, but those may be protected due to historical content.",
      "The Air Force briefly removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen soon after the president's order. That drew the White House's ire over \"malicious compliance,\" and the Air Force quickly reversed the removal.",
      "Many of the images listed in the database already have been removed. Others were still visible Thursday, and it's not clear if they will be taken down at some point or be allowed to stay, including images with historical significance such as those of the Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "Asked about the database, Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement, \"We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct components accordingly.\"",
      "He noted that Hegseth has declared that \"DEI is dead\" and that efforts to put one group ahead of another through DEI programs erodes camaraderie and threatens mission execution.",
      "In some cases, the removal was partial. The main page in a post titled \"Women's History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters\" was removed. But at least one of the photos in that collection about an all-female C-17 crew could still be accessed. A shot from the Army Corps of Engineers titled \"Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month\" was deleted.",
      "Other photos flagged in the database but still visible Thursday included images of the World War II Women Air Service Pilots and one of U.S. Air Force Col. Jeannie Leavitt, the country's first female fighter pilot.",
      "Also still visible was an image of then-Pfc. Christina Fuentes Montenegro becoming one of the first three women to graduate from the Marine Corps' Infantry Training Battalion and an image of Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves.",
      "It was unclear why some other images were removed, such as a Marine Corps photo titled \"Deadlift contenders raise the bar pound by pound\" or a National Guard website image called \"Minnesota brothers reunite in Kuwait.\"",
      "The database of the 26,000 images was created to conform with federal archival laws, so if the services are queried in the future, they can show how they are complying with the law, the U.S. official said. But it may be difficult to ensure the content was archived because the responsibility to ensure each image was preserved was the responsibility of each individual unit.",
      "In many cases, workers are taking screenshots of the pages marked for removal, but it would be difficult to restore them if that decision was made, according to another official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that were not public.",
      "A Marine Corps official said every one of its images in the database \"either has been taken down or will be taken down.\" The Marines are moving on the directive as fast as possible, but as with the rest of the military, very few civilian or contractor employees at the Pentagon can perform content removal, the official said.",
      "In the Marine Corps, just one defense civilian is available to do the work. The Marine Corps estimates that person has identified at least 10,000 images for removal - and that does not count more than 1,600 social media sites that have not yet been addressed.",
      "Many of those social media sites were military base or unit support groups created years ago and left idle. No one still has the administrative privileges to go in and change the content.",
      "The Marine official said the service is going through each site and getting new administrative privileges so it can make the changes.",
      "On Feb. 26, the Pentagon ordered all the military services to spend countless hours poring over years of website postings, photos, news articles and videos to remove any mentions that \"promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\"",
      "If they couldn't do that by Wednesday, they were told to \"temporarily remove from public display\" all content published during the Biden administration's four years in office.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 05:00:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA has relied on food companies for decades to determine whether their ingredients are safe.",
    "story": [
      "Joseph Shea, who sells athletic wear in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, wonders and worries about the food he eats.",
      "The chemical ingredients with mystifying names. The references on product labels to unspecified natural or artificial flavors. The junk food that fits his budget but feels addictive and makes him feel unwell.",
      "Shea, one of 1,310 people who responded to a poll the health policy research group KFF conducted on health care priorities, said he assumes the FDA is making sure the ingredients are safe.",
      "In many cases, it is not.",
      "The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. There are at least 950 substances in our food that are not permitted in Europe, according to one expert's estimate, and chemicals linked to health concerns show up in hundreds of products that line the shelves of American supermarkets.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end \"the mass poisoning of American children.\" At a March 6 confirmation hearing, Martin Makary, President Trump's nominee to head the FDA, expressed concern about foods \"with a lot of molecules that do not appear in nature.\"",
      "\"These are chemicals that the industry insists are safe, a subset of which are concerning,\" he said.",
      "But the Trump administration's initial moves to reduce staff at the FDA led the director of its food safety unit, Jim Jones, to resign last month and raised fears among food safety specialists that the administration could weaken oversight.",
      "To a great extent, the FDA leaves it to food companies to determine whether their ingredients and additives are safe. Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels.",
      "Though pharmaceutical companies are required to share research on humans with the FDA, the agency is largely blind to what food-makers know about their products.",
      "\"The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to,\" Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner.",
      "As a result: The FDA's oversight of food additives is much weaker than its oversight of prescription drugs.",
      "\"There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food,\" Califf testified.",
      "Food is a big business. American consumers spend almost $1.7 trillion annually on food and beverages, according to Circana, a research and advisory firm.",
      "Yet American food companies keep secret much of what they put in their products.",
      "KFF Health News asked nine of the largest food manufacturers \u2014 The Coca-Cola Co., Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellanova (successor to Kellogg), The Kraft Heinz Co., Mondel\u0113z International, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, and Unilever \u2014 for the number of ingredients, if any, that go unnamed on their product labels and the names of those ingredients deemed safe without involvement by the FDA, and substances used in their products in the United States but not in Europe, and vice versa.",
      "None provided answers to those questions.",
      "\"We focus on the quality of the ingredients that we use, and all comply with applicable regulatory requirements,\" Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Dana Stambaugh said.",
      "Chemicals such as titanium dioxide and potassium bromate, whose safety has been debated, are allowed in foods in the United States but not in Europe.",
      "Corporations may turn a blind eye to potential dangers, a July 2024 FDA-funded report warned.",
      "Potentially harmful ingredients \"are not necessarily required to be named on a product label,\" the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an adjunct to the agency, said in the report, which was based largely on interviews with representatives of companies across the food supply chain.",
      "\"Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,\" the report said.",
      "Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as \"spices\" and \"artificial flavors,\" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.",
      "And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels \u2014 potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes \u2014 have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.",
      "Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are \"deliberately designed to be addictive,\" contributing to an epidemic of obesity \u2014 a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. \"And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,\" he said.",
      "The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as \"rigorous,\" \"evidence-based,\" and \"proven.\" The system enables companies \"to innovate to meet consumer demand,\" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.",
      "\"Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,\" Gallo added.",
      "More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States \u2014 and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.",
      "\"The system is fundamentally broken,\" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. \"It's so bad, nobody knows \u2014 not even FDA knows \u2014 what's in our food.\"",
      "Banned abroad",
      "The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.",
      "The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.\" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.",
      "The FDA allows potassium bromate\u00a0to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.",
      "Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a \"genotoxic carcinogen\" in 1992.",
      "On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.",
      "The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight \u2014 which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.",
      "Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.",
      "Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.",
      "A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.",
      "\"That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,\" Millstone said.",
      "\"Several decades behind Europeans\"",
      "When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them \u2014 even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.",
      "In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)",
      "In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.",
      "\"In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them,\" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. \"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.\"",
      "The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.",
      "Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as \"an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.",
      "FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS \"to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.\"",
      "\"The loophole swallowed the law\"",
      "The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.",
      "In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances \"generally recognized as safe,\" which came to be known simply as GRAS.",
      "As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder \u2014 along with many chemicals.",
      "Over time, \"the loophole swallowed the law,\" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.",
      "A better translation of GRAS would be \"Generally Recognized as SECRET,\" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.",
      "A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. \"GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.",
      "That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.",
      "For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says \"such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.\"",
      "About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.",
      "The scientists on the FEMA panel \"adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,\" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.",
      "Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.",
      "Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.",
      "\"Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,\" he added.",
      "Another way",
      "Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons \u2014 giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.",
      "If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.",
      "And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.",
      "FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.",
      "For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.",
      "But if companies market products as \"generally recognized as safe\" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.",
      "Psyched out",
      "On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.",
      "An \"independent review panel of scientific experts\" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was \"Generally Recognized As Safe,\" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.",
      "The company described the panel's judgment as a successful \"certification\" and \"a key milestone.\" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said \"has incredible healing and medicinal powers.\" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained \"self-Gras status.\"",
      "In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.",
      "However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.",
      "In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.",
      "Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known \"pharmacologically active constituents,\" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have \"potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\"",
      "The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's \"Diamond Shruumz\" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.",
      "The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.",
      "The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.",
      "The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.",
      "As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will \"continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.\"",
      "\"Probably poisoning us\"",
      "If food ingredients cause acute reactions \u2014 sending people to emergency rooms, for example \u2014 the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.",
      "Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.",
      "All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.",
      "For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.",
      "Shea said the entire picture is \"incredibly frustrating.\"",
      "\"They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says he's suspending security clearances of lawyers at Perkins Coie, which was involved in launching oppo research during the 2016 campaign into any ties between Trump and Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday he was moving to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia.",
      "The sanction against Perkins Coie is the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Trump and his administration to target a broad cross-section of perceived adversaries, including Justice Department prosecutors, career intelligence officials and, most recently, private-practice attorneys.",
      "\"This is an absolute honor to sign. What they've done is just terrible. It's weaponization \u2014 you could say weaponization against a political opponent, and it should never be allowed to happen again,\" Mr. Trump said as he prepared to sign the executive order in the Oval Office.",
      "The order directs the attorney general, the director of national intelligence and other relevant agency heads to \"take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\" It does not specify how many lawyers at the law firm would be subject to losing their clearances.",
      "It also instructs agency heads to restrict access to government buildings by attorneys at the firm \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States\" and to identify, and cancel, contracts they have with the firm.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the firm said, \"We have reviewed the Executive Order. It is patently unlawful, and we intend to challenge it.\"",
      "The punishment arises from the hiring by Perkins Coie of Fusion GPS, a research and intelligence firm, to conduct opposition research on then-candidate Trump's potential ties to Russia. The arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, who at the time was a well-connected partner at Perkins Coie and top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, but who has since left the firm and started his own practice.",
      "Fusion GPS in return retained former British spy Christopher Steele, whose dossier of research circulated among journalists and government officials in Washington during the campaign. The dossier, which was turned over to the FBI for its review, contended that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him.",
      "But the material has since been largely discredited as containing salacious and unverified rumors linking Trump to Russia, with special counsel John Durham's 2023 report on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation saying that FBI investigators who tried to corroborate Steele's findings were unable to verify a \"single substantive allegation.\" Steele has stood by his work.",
      "The dossier created a political firestorm in January 2017, when it was revealed that then-FBI Director James Comey had briefed Trump before he took office on the existence of allegations from the research. The subsequent revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had helped fund the dossier added to questions about the legitimacy of Steele's research, which Trump as president repeatedly attacked as \"phony\" and inaccurate.",
      "Trump and his allies have long tried to use the dossier's flaws to undermine the entire investigation into connections between his 2016 campaign and Russia. But the investigation began weeks before the FBI agents who were working on it came into possession of dossier and was opened based on an entirely different tip \u2014 that a Trump campaign aide claimed to have knowledge that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, well before Russia was known to have hacked Democratic emails.",
      "And though special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not conclude that Russia and the Trump campaign had criminally conspired to tip the election, it did identify a sweeping effort by the Kremlin to intervene on the Republican candidate's behalf, as well as evidence that the campaign welcomed the help.",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired Justice Department prosecutors who participated in special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump. It also said it was stripping security clearances of lawyers who provided legal services for Smith and of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed onto a 2020 letter asserting that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The Perkins Coie executive order also alleges that the firm engages in what the Trump administration describes as unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "That follows a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that calls on the Justice Department's civil rights division to \"investigate, eliminate and penalize illegal\" DEI \"preferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\"",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the most prominent Democratic party voices, said Thursday on his new podcast that it's \"deeply unfair\" to allow transgender women to participate in women's sports, marking a turn for a politician who first made national headlines when he issued marriage licenses for same-sex couples as San Francisco mayor in 2004.",
      "Newsom is already facing blowback from his own party after comments he made in the debut episode of his podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "The podcast is being touted by Newsom as a way to \"change the conversation\" by talking directly to people on the opposite side of his politics. In the first episode, released Thursday, Newsom sits down with conservative media figure Charlie Kirk from Turning Point USA.",
      "Newsom waded into the issue of transgender athletes after Kirk mentions the recent news of a high school trans athlete in California who won a girls' triple jump event.",
      "\"I think it's an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said.",
      "Further into the conversation, Newsom talked about a Trump campaign ad that ran ahead of the 2024 presidential election, which highlighted then-Vice President Kamala Harris' previous support for gender-affirming care for incarcerated people.",
      "\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom told Kirk.",
      "Newsom's comments seem to run counter to the governor's longstanding support of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "After the podcast debuted Thursday, the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus released a statement calling Newsom's comments \"anti-transgender.\"",
      "\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not. We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,\" said Assemblymember Chris Ward (D-San Diego) and state Sen. Caroline Menjivar (D-Burbank)   in a joint statement.",
      "The LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality California also criticized Newsom's comments, saying they were \"disappointed and angered.\"",
      "\"His comments are all the more harmful in the context of the continued attack on the rights and dignity of transgender people happening at all levels of government across the country,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Newsom's personal social media pages have been promoting the podcast, including reposting a picture of him and Kirk with the caption \"We had quite the chat!\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 22:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Retired Lt.-Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said he thinks Ukraine could \"move forward\" after signing a key minerals deal.",
    "story": [
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, says Ukrainians brought the pause in U.S. intelligence sharing \"on themselves.\"",
      "It's \"sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said of the impact of the intelligence pause on the battlefield. \"Got their attention.\"",
      "The intelligence the U.S. has been sharing has been critical in helping Ukraine strike Russian military targets, as well as anticipate and block Russian attacks.",
      "\"But it's a pause. It's not an end,\" Kellogg told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan in an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations Thursday. \"But it's sort of of like, okay, we're trying to get your attention.\"",
      "\"That's a pretty major concession to Russia, to constrain Ukraine's ability to target and hit Russian forces,\" Brennan said, pointing out, \"this pressure really seems to be directly impacting, potentially, what they can do on the battlefield.\"",
      "\"Very candidly, they brought it on themselves,\" Kellogg responded, to hisses from the audience.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe acknowledged the intelligence sharing pause Wednesday, a move that followed the contentious White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Friday. The meeting with President Trump was supposed to culminate in the signing of a rare earth minerals deal but instead ended in recrimination, as Zelenskyy sought to remind the president and Vice President JD Vance of the treaties Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken in the past, while Mr. Trump and Vance berated the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office, accusing him of not saying \"thank you\" for U.S. military aid.",
      "Though Kellogg indicated that intelligence sharing could resume, he declined to say when. \"That's up to the president of the United States,\" he told Brennan.",
      "Kellogg also said the Trump administration would be willing to work with Zelenskyy once the minerals agreement is finalized.",
      "\"Sign a document, and then once you sign the document that you want to go forward, that you're serious about it, then I think you can move forward,\" said Kellogg. \"When I was in Kyiv two weeks ago, I was very clear to President Zelenskyy \u2014 the outcome if we didn't have a signed agreement.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now likely to be the administration official who signs the deal with Ukraine. And next week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff expects to meet with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he told reporters Thursday.",
      "Witkoff met with Putin for about three and a half hours last month in Russia and returned to the U.S. with \"an indication of where the Russians are\" on peace negotiations, Kellogg said.",
      "\"We want to do the same thing with the Ukrainians, as well,\" Kellogg told Brennan.",
      "Notably, Kellogg denied an earlier statement by Witkoff that the Istanbul protocol, drafted shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, could serve as the basis for a peace deal framework between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "The right-leaning Institute for the Study of War describes the Istanbul protocol as \"entirely incompatible with the current stated U.S. policy\" and argues it \"cannot be the basis or guidepost for negotiations that amount to anything other than capitulation to Russia's pre-war demands.\"",
      "The institute noted that a draft of that agreement would have had Ukraine surrender its sovereignty and would have prevented it from maintaining armed forces sufficient to deter a Russian attack.",
      "\"Steve said it's a departure point. I think that's a good word to use,\" said Kellogg. \"I don't believe for all of us that that is an equitable framework. And I think we have to develop something entirely new,\" he continued.",
      "\"I think Steve made a comment as a general comment, and it is not the Trump administration policy\u00a0 because they haven't made their policy,\" he added.",
      "At this point, Kellogg estimates that the Ukrainians should have enough military aid to continue fighting through the summer.",
      "\"They have an ability with the assets they've got to continue to prosecute the fight, to do it,\" said Kellogg.",
      "Kellogg would not confirm that as part of a peace agreement the U.S. would backstop any European peacekeeping forces by providing security guarantees to Ukraine.",
      "\"That's part of the discussion we're having with the Europeans as well \u2014 when you talk what does [a] backstop look like,\" said Kellogg.",
      "\"What does that look like on the economic side, what do sanctions look like, what do frozen assets, whatever it's going to be? And then we also look at the military side as well,\" he said.",
      "Beyond bringing the conflict to a close, Kellogg also said president seeks a \"reset\" of U.S. relations with Russia.",
      "\"The need to reset relations with Russia to secure Americans' vital national interest, and ultimately, to stop U.S. entanglement in an endless proxy war, are the driving reasons why President Trump's approach and the framing of this war is distinct from the broader, conventional approach that we see publicly to the war,\" said Kellogg.",
      "He acknowledged, however, that existing sanctions against Russia need to be enforced more aggressively to be more effective.",
      "If you ranked U.S. sanctions against Russia on a scale of 1 to 7, he said, \"the problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a 3.\"",
      "\"I think the most important thing is the enforcement of sanctions \u2014 not necessarily the sanctions themselves,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "A former government official who says she was falsely accused of illegally sending funds to New York City to book luxury hotels for undocumented migrants \u2014 and then publicly ridiculed and fired \u2014 said Thursday that just days earlier she had been directed by a member of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to make the payments.",
      "Mary Comans, who was the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, sued the agency and the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, on Tuesday.",
      "\"I was fired illegally by the Trump administration for doing my job, for doing exactly what I was directed to do by the Trump political appointees at the Department of Homeland Security and at the DOGE,\" she told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson did not respond for comment, nor did Brad Smith, the DOGE official Comans says she interacted with.",
      "The lawsuit argues she was \"unlawfully terminated\" from her position \"without cause or the due process required by law and the Constitution.\" As chief financial officer, Comans was a member of the \"senior executive service,\" the highest-level civil servant.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that DHS and FEMA publicly disclosed information about her",
      "termination that was protected under the Privacy Act and that she was defamed by the false portrayal about her conduct. At the time of her dismissal, Comans says the agency suggested falsely in a press release that she was a \"deep state activist.\"",
      "Comans joined DHS in 2004, inspired to serve in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. She called herself \"apolitical,\" noting that she served both Republican and Democratic administrations, often deploying to the scenes of natural disasters to help manage the federal government's response.",
      "\"My job is to serve the administration that was elected by the American people,\" she said.",
      "She had served as FEMA's chief financial officer since 2017 before she was abruptly fired on Feb. 11.",
      "During President Trump's first days back in office, Comans said the executive leadership team at FEMA was fielding executive orders as quickly as the president could sign them and \"were implementing them to the letter that he expected.\"",
      "One of the orders Comans carried out required DHS, and by extension FEMA, to freeze money going to nongovernmental organizations that provide services to undocumented immigrants. Payments that continued came from a $650 million Customs and Border Protection program created by Congress to reimburse cities for housing and sheltering migrants that had entered into the country illegally and were awaiting court proceedings. FEMA administered payments issued by the immigration program, but those funds were separate from the billions of dollars the agency spends on disaster relief.",
      "On Feb. 5, Comans says she and her team met with Smith, one of Elon Musk's top lieutenants, who was overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency's work at DHS. According to Comans, Smith instructed them to keep the funds from the CBP program flowing.",
      "Comans said it was \"very clear\" from the conversation with Smith \"that FEMA was doing the right thing in continuing\" the payments.",
      "\"We also received written guidance from the acting general counsel at FEMA that payments to state and locals needed to continue under the normal course of business,\" she said.",
      "Despite those assurances from Smith, on Feb. 10, Musk posted on X that DOGE \"just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President's executive order.\"",
      "Later that day, when she arrived at work, Comans says she met with her boss, acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton. She says Hamilton was also surprised by Musk's tweet and told her she had done nothing wrong. Comans then drafted a report, which CBS News reviewed, that documented her conversations with DOGE.",
      "\"I told him I was going to put together an after-action report detailing each of the conversations, the dates, the actions that FEMA took to show that we were operating within the guidelines provided to use by the Trump administration,\" Comans said. \"He thanked me, hugged me and again reassured me that nobody at FEMA would be fired for making these payments.\"",
      "Comans said she had another conversation with Hamilton that night to tell him that the funds had been recouped.",
      "\"I shared with him that I had successfully reversed the payment and the funds were being returned to Treasury as we speak,\" she said.",
      "The next morning, on Feb. 11, Comans says a colleague walked into Coman's office to tell her that she had been terminated effective immediately.",
      "\"Unfortunately, my colleague had no answers to provide me,\" Comans said.",
      "Her name went viral later that morning after conservative broadcaster Benny Johnson posted on X that Comans was \"fired for illegally funding migrant luxury hotels in NYC against the orders of President Trump.\" The post was spread by other rightwing accounts.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security sent out its press release about the firings shortly after that.",
      "\"Effective immediately, FEMA is terminating the employment of four individuals for circumventing leadership to unilaterally make egregious payments for luxury NYC hotels for migrants. Firings include FEMA's Chief Financial Officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist,\" the release said. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS will not sit idly and allow deep state activists to undermine the will and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Musk also shared a post about Comans, writing that her behavior was \"criminal.\"",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",

      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",

      "\"We will review the data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"Obviously, a lot to go through, a lot to dig through. We're going to go right at it,\" said SpaceX launch commentator Dan Huot. \"The primary reason we do these flight tests is to learn. We have some more to learn about this vehicle, but we're going to be right back here in the not-too-distant future, and we're going to get a ship to space.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said it has ordered a\u00a0mishap investigation\u00a0into the loss of the Starship.",

      "Three days after a last-minute scrub due to unspecified technical issues, SpaceX fired up the Super Heavy first stage's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines at 6:30 p.m. EST. Two seconds later, the tallest, most powerful rocket in the world lifted off from the company's launch site on the Texas Gulf Coast.",

      "After boosting the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere, the 230-foot-tall, 30-foot-wide Super Heavy first stage booster flew itself back to the launch site and into the grasp of two giant mechanical arms known as \"chopsticks\" mounted on the side of the launch tower.",
      "The chopsticks closed around the slowly descending booster, locking onto structural capture fixtures on both sides of the rocket. The dramatic launch pad capture, SpaceX's third, is a key element in the company's plan to enable rapid refurbishment and reuse.",

      "Trouble 8 minutes after liftoff",
      "But a little more than eight minutes after liftoff, telemetry shown on SpaceX's live webcast indicated four of the six engines had prematurely shut down. A camera on the Starship showed the spacecraft starting to spin about and several seconds later contact was lost.",
      "Multiple videos posted on social media showed a dramatic shower of debris arcing back toward Earth after the vehicle broke up. It wasn't immediately clear if the breakup was triggered by the Starship's self-destruct system or by extreme structural loads as it fell back into the lower atmosphere.",
      "While SpaceX will no doubt attempt its usual rapid recovery, the Federal Aviation Administration will almost certainly order another failure investigation. Given two destructive breakups in a row, it could take longer to return to flight status this time around.",
      "The flight plan called for a battery of tests, including the deployment of four simulated Starlink satellites to test the Starship's payload release system, the in-space restart of one of the rocket's Raptor engines and tests of new heat shield materials and components needed for the eventual pad capture of returning Starships.",
      "At the conclusion of the sub-orbital flight, the Starship was expected fall back into the atmosphere belly first.

      "During the program's seventh integrated flight test, or IFT, in January, a fire developed just above the Super Heavy first stage engines and contact was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch.",
      "Three minutes after that, the rocket's self-destruct system triggered an explosion that broke the Starship apart, producing a spectacular shower of flaming debris that rained down along the flight path.",
      "Telemetry indicated the fire broke out after propellant lines leading to one of the Raptors ruptured due to unexpected harmonic vibrations. SpaceX carried out a 60-second engine test firing of the Starship launched Monday, studying responses to various thrust levels.",
      "Based on the test results, propellant feed lines were modified, fuel temperatures were changed and thrust levels were adjusted to avoid any such harmonic responses. Additional vents were installed in the area where the fire broke out and a nitrogen purge system was added to minimize the chance of fire.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander is \"alive,\" but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",

    "story": [
      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",
      "\"Knowing where the air is really moving tells you a lot about what your vehicle is doing, how efficient it is, and how you can make it better,\" Ed Haering, principal investigator for the Schlieren photography, said in a 2023 NASA news release.",

      "Capt. Cheryl Schofield: Her body had basically been folded into this box. It was a picture of what you would see in a horror movie.",

      "Peter Van Sant: And how old were you then?",

      "As investigative journalists for the Las Vegas Review-Journal Briana Erickson and Rhonda Prast had seen a lot of bad people do a lot of bad things. But nothing came close to the Machiavellian plot to murder their friend and colleague, Jeff German.",
      "Rhonda Prast: Jeff German was at his house, on vacation. He'd gone out to get something to eat. He came back, shut his garage door.",
      "Rhonda Prast: You could see in the surveillance video from across the street that \u2026 Someone, an assailant, came into his yard, went to the left side of his house, went inside the gate, shut the gate.",
      "Briana Erickson: And then we see Jeff, moments later, opening his garage door and he was instantly ambushed when he turned the corner to where that person was lying in wait. \u2026 In the video, you can kind of see a struggle, but German ultimately falls to the ground, and he never gets up.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What happened to him in that attack?",
      "Rhonda Prast: Jeff was stabbed \u2026 He was stabbed seven times, four times in the neck, three in the torso.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Seven stab wounds \u2026 did that suggest what kind of a killing this was?",
      "Rhonda Prast: To me, this was a very personal attack. To stab someone in such a short time viciously seven times, with no warning.",
      "A concerned neighbor found German's body hidden behind some bushes 24 hours later.",
      "911 OPERATOR: 911 emergency \u2026 Do you need police, fire, medical?",
      "NEIGHBOR: I have a neighbor across the street from me. He's laying in the side yard, um, I believe he's dead. He's got blood over him.",
      "Rhonda Prast: It was just a terrible thing to know that he was lying there, and we wondered whether he could have been saved. But medical experts told us later \u2026 that he likely died within a minute or two.",
      "It was a small mercy for a man who had spent his life fighting for the underdog.",
      "Rhonda Prast: At the base, he just wanted to help people and protect people you know \u2026 and expose wrongdoing.",
      "From the start, German was shooting for big game. And when he came from Wisconsin in the 1970s las Vegas was the Serengeti. Mark Fierro, a TV reporter at the time, became a lifelong friend and trusted source.",
      "Mark Fierro: Jeff German at the outset was a, a \u2026 reporter who caught the most important beat in Las Vegas of his day that was organized crime.",
      "Then a reporter for the Las Vegas Sun, German took on one of the biggest, meanest mobsters on the strip \u2014 Tony Spilotro, a power player for the Chicago Mob, who was played by Joe Pesci in Martin Scorsese's film, \"Casino.\"",
      "German talked about Spilotro in the podcast \"Mobbed Up\" about a year before he died:",
      "JEFF GERMAN | \"Mobbed Up\" podcast: He had a reputation of being a brutal killer, yet he was never convicted of a single murder \u00a0\u2026 He had the coldest eyes I've ever seen.",
      "JEFF GERMAN | \"Mobbed Up\" podcast: In my stories, I got used to calling Spilotro by his street name \u2013 Tony the Ant. He hated that and it sometimes left me at the receiving end of Spilotro's nasty stares and his menacing fits of anger.",
      "Mark Fierro: The irony of all of this is \u2014 is that Jeff \u2026 was not a tall man, was not a strong man, but he toughed it out and he went toe to toe with these guys year in and year out. And some of these guys were dangerous guys.",
      "Try as they did, they couldn't scare him, says Erickson.",
      "Briana Erickson: After his tires had been slashed and some spooky things were happening to him, he told a mob affiliate in a bar to call off his dogs. Then he got punched in the face. He later described that as a badge of honor.",
      "JEFF GERMAN | \"Mobbed Up\" podcast: A couple of hours later with four stitches under my lip, I had a war story to tell.",
      "As the mob slowly lost its grip on Vegas, German built a career exposing dirty business, government corruption and crime. Prast, the former assistant managing editor for investigations at the Review-Journal, worked with him for three years.",
      "Rhonda Prast: He kept digging and digging and digging, and he was like the dog, the little dog \u2014 that would take a bite of your pants and wouldn't let go. You know, he was just so laser focused on continuing to go deeper and deeper and deeper into a story.",
      "That tenacity helped him expose the truth in stories that could have remained in the shadows. He was one of the few journalists, along with his colleague David Ferrara, to report on the Susan Winters case \u2014 a woman whose parents doubted the suicide ruling in their daughter's death.",
      "Mark Fierro: And Jeff started putting pieces together. \u2026 working with the attorney for the family \u2026 that the way that she killed herself was so unseemly that it just didn't add up. \u2026 And once he started \u2026 he started pulling on that thread, and then he started pulling on a rope and then it turned into a chain.",
      "That chain turned into a series of stories that targeted the husband. Turns out Winters died from ingesting a lethal combination of painkillers and antifreeze. The husband, who was charged with murder, ultimately pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sent to prison.",
      "As hard-charging and public as German was in his work life, the lifelong bachelor was notoriously private about his personal life.",
      "Mark Fierro: He was always back to business, back to business. This man was born to be a reporter.",
      "The entire newsroom rallied together. His colleagues had no idea who did this or why, but they were determined to do what German would have done: find out.",
      "WHO WANTED JEFF GERMAN DEAD?",
      "The Review-Journal staff was in mourning. Their sorrow \u2014 cards and flowers\u2014 in full display on German's desk.",
      "Briana Erickson: It's a reminder that \u2026 this team is not gonna be the same without him \u2026 But we can carry on the way he would want us to.",
      "And that meant doing what he would have done. The staff started tugging on threads and searching for clues, working nonstop on one of the most important stories of their careers: who killed Jeff German?",
      "Rhonda Prast: Immediately, I started thinking in my head, all right, who had threatened Jeff in any way in the last five months? Who could have possibly done this?",
      "Executive editor Glenn Cook asked Prast to come up with a short list of people to consider.",
      "Rhonda Prast: One of the names I gave him was Robert Telles.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And who is Robert Telles?",
      "Rhonda Prast: He was a Clark County elected official, in charge of the Public Administrator's Office, which handles estates of people who were deceased.",
      "One of the estate coordinators in Telles' office, Aleisha Goodwin, had reached out to German in March 2022. She had filed a formal complaint with the County Office of Diversity on behalf of herself and some colleagues claiming Telles harassed, bullied, and discriminated against them.",
      "Rita Reid: He was a horrible, a horrible human being \u2026 Monster is the right word.",
      "But Goodwin says, the county did nothing.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: It was always, \"he's an elected official. There's nothing we can do.\"",
      "German agreed to hear what Goodwin and her colleagues, Noraine Pagdanganan, Rita Reid and Jessica Coleman, had to say.",
      "Jessica Coleman: And when he finally talked to us and he let us tell what had happened to us and he said, \"No, I'm going to look into this.\" \u2026 I think that's the only thing that gave us enough energy to keep going.",
      "According to the women, the trouble began almost immediately after Telles took office in January 2019. Reid, a supervisor, was his second in command and a 12-year veteran of the office.",
      "Rita Reid: He came in very abruptly into the office and he slammed his palms down on my desk (slams hands on table) with a \u2014 with a real loud bang.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Like a (slaps hands on table).",
      "Rita Reid: Oh, yes, absolutely. And he leaned forward, and he said, \"we're ripping off the bandage. You no longer supervise anyone, no one reports to you. \u2026 They all report to me.\" And he turned around and he walked out. And I just sat there stunned.",
      "The women say they were ordered not to speak to each other in the office.",
      "Jessica Coleman It felt dangerous to even have a hello, good morning, conversation with coworkers in passing.",
      "If caught, the consequences could be severe, says Goodwin. She remembers getting called into Telles' office after he saw her and two other women talking",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: We walked into his office, and he said, \"sit down and shut up. You're not gonna talk. \u2026 I'm gonna talk.\" \u2026 And he just got this look on his face, he sits back, and he pointed at Noraine and said, \"f*** you.\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: What was it like to be in that room ... receiving that?",
      "Noraine Pagdanganan: It was scary \u2026 because \u2026 I \u2026 Did not want to upset him because I knew how he could be.",
      "Despite years of service, all the women say they feared for their jobs. And Coleman,\u00a0 who safeguarded the property of the deceased in a caged room, says she feared for her physical safety. She says Telles would sometimes come in and threaten her.",
      "Jessica Coleman: There was an instance where he got in my face and, you know, he's yelling and I'm sort of backed up against, um, the cage door.",
      "Peter Van Sant: He was trying to physically intimidate you?",
      "Jessica Coleman: Yes, yes. \u2026 He would bring his chairs up really close and \u2014 and demand that you really pay attention and look him in the eye while he told you horrible things.",
      "One of those horrible things, says Coleman, almost did her in. Alone in the cage together, she says, Telles started by saying that he noticed she never talked to anyone in the office, a bizarre comment considering his no-talking rule.",
      "Jessica Coleman: \"If you keep going down this road, you're going to be like our cases and you're just going to die alone, and nobody is going to find you.\" \u2026 and I sat there and cried. Um, and then after that \u2026 it's hard to admit. (Crying) Then I started, um, thinking the best thing I could do would be to sacrifice myself for the girls.",
      "Jessica Coleman: (Crying) And I had actually picked out a place, um, that I was going to hang myself in the hall in view of the door, because he would always come by and \u2014 and make sure I was working. And I thought this will be good. If they have to find me this way, then the county will have to do something.",
      "Mercifully, Coleman realized that was not the solution to the problem.",
      "But they came up with another plan. The women believed Telles was having an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate in the office named Roberta. Roberta, they claimed, used that relationship to assume power and privilege beyond her job title.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Is there any doubt in your mind that the two of them were having a romantic affair?",
      "Rita Reid: No.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: No.",
      "Jessica Coleman: Absolutely not.",
      "Peter Van Sant: None whatsoever",
      "Jessica Coleman: No because we --",
      "But they needed proof. So they decided to follow them.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: We had seen a pattern, short dress day. If they went the same direction, we knew that we needed to go.",
      "It was always to the same place, says Goodwin \u2014 a parking garage in a nearby mall. The alleged lovers would park next to each other.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: We started to take pictures and we started to video.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So how did you position yourselves where you could get some video?",
      "Rita Reid: Very carefully.",
      "Peter Van Sant: In a car?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Sometimes in a car. Sometimes we would get out of our car. There were \u2014 there were kind of some cutouts and pillars where you could get angles here and there. \u2026 And we just tried to move around and to get the best that we could.",
      "According to the women, the alleged lovers would ultimately end up in the back seat of Roberta's car.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Roberta has said that they would sit in the back seat because she wanted to be able to make eye contact with him as they were having \u2014",
      "Jessica Coleman: Mm-hmm.",
      "Peter Van Sant: \u2014 important office discussions.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Yeah.",
      "Jessica Coleman: Yes.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: That is what she said.",
      "Peter Van Sant: OK. And your reaction to that?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Well, that last video we got, we had a little better recorder. You can see the \u2014 the shadows. And you can see those heads going together.",
      "Rita Reid: We felt it was so inappropriate.",
      "But this was the shot they believed was the most telling: Roberta leaving the car and smoothing down her dress.",
      "Rita Reid: It was so unbelievable, and it just took a moment to \u2014 to digest that it would \u2014 I mean, at that moment it was like so real.",
      "After seeing the videos, German asked Roberta about them. She responded, \"I have not had an inappropriate relationship with him.\"\u00a0 The Review-Journal published the story.",
      "Peter Van Sant (reads aloud): Let me read the lead in this first article:",
      "\"The Clark County Public Administrator's Office has been mired in turmoil and internal dissension over the past two years with allegations of emotional stress, bullying and favoritism, leading to secret videotaping of the boss and a co-worker outside the office.\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: That story went all over the state of Nevada and before long, all over the country.",
      "Peter Van Sant: As this settled in, are you thinking mission accomplished or you thinking what's gonna happen to us next?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Both.",
      "Jessica Coleman: Yeah, the terror didn't stop. The terror almost just got worse. It just changed face.",
      "THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS",
      "German's story with its allegations of turmoil, bullying and hostility had a swift and searing effect at the Public Administrator's Office. The county finally sent in an outside consultant, and Robert Telles lost his bid for re-election in the primary, ironically, to his arch enemy: Rita Reid.",
      "But German wasn't through with Telles yet. He wrote three more scathing pieces chronicling the fall of the once up-and-coming young Democrat, and another story was in the works.",
      "But German did not survive to write it.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Jeff German was found stabbed to death outside his home in the Northwest Valley ...",
      "When news of German's murder broke, the women German had fought for were overcome with grief, but also dread \u2014 afraid of what they may have unleashed.",
      "Goodwin's dad, a former Las Vegas police detective who introduced her to German, said what they were all thinking.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: My dad called me first thing in the morning and said that Jeff had been killed and I didn't even get to react before my dad's next word were, \"I know who my first suspect is.\" \u2026 As soon as those words came out of his mouth, I knew immediately too.",
      "Peter Van Sant: That it was Robert?",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: That it was Robert.",
      "The staff at the Las Vegas Review-Journal was wondering the same thing. Could Telles have been involved?",
      "Peter Van Sant: The journalistic hounds are \u2014 are released, right?",
      "Art Kane: Yes. We weren't gonna do anything until every little rock was overturned and every little fact was found out about what \u2014 what this guy was and who he was.",
      "Art Kane, now the investigations editor, was a reporter at the time.",
      "Art Kane: And we started finding out a lot of interesting things about him. For example \u2026 He was arrested while he was public administrator \u2026 for choking his wife.",
      "911 CALL: Can you please send somebody here? My husband is going crazy.",
      "Art Kane: There's bodycam video that we have obtained of that.",
      "ROBERT TELLES (police bodycam video): Who did I hit? ... cameras, cameras.",
      "OFFICER: Our cameras are on.",
      "ROBERT TELLES: You guys just wanna take me down 'cause I'm a public official.",
      "Telles, slurring his words, was arrested for domestic battery and resisting arrest",
      "ROBERT TELLES (police bodycam video): There's sufficient evidence to book me right now?",
      "OFFICER: There is sufficient evidence to book you right now, yes.",
      "ROBERT TELLES: And I'm \u2014 I'm not trying to be like \"I'm a public official so you know, do what I want you to f****** do.\" I'm saying, I'm not a f***** idiot.",
      "He received a suspended 90-day sentence on the resisting charge and was ordered to attend a corrective thinking class. The battery charge was dismissed.",
      "Art Kane: No one ever heard about it because \u2026 no one covers \u2026 DUIs and domestics, and that flew under the radar.",
      "Looking back, there were other warning signs, says Erickson. Such as a series of tweets Telles posted in response to German's reporting.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Read that one for me.",
      "Briana Erickson (reading tweet): \"Looking forward to lying smear piece #4 by @JGermanRJ. #onetrickpony. I think he's mad that I haven't crawled into a hole and died. (Laughing emoji.)\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: What did you think of that one?",
      "Briana\u00a0Erickson: Somebody who's pretty pissed off.",
      "But the journalists knew angry tweets didn't prove anything. They needed facts. And facts were hard to come by.",
      "All they had were two still surveillance photographs the police had released of the suspect in German's neighborhood.",
      "The outfit, bizarre as it seems, may have been a strategic choice, says Kane.",
      "Art Kane: The outfit is very typical of what construction workers and people who do landscaping wear because they wanna cover up all their skin from the sun.",
      "When the police released a surveillance video, Review-Journal photographer Kevin Cannon immediately noticed something the big hat and orange reflective shirt couldn't hide: the man's walk; his gait.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How would you describe that gait?",
      "Kevin Cannon: It's \u2014 it's a bit of a \u2014 a limp and a favor on one side, it seems.",
      "Cannon went digging in his files and found a walking shot he had taken of Telles when Jeff interviewed him at his office. The staff compared both videos side by side.",
      "Kevin Cannon: I'm not sure how to describe it, but it was definitely the identical gait in my mind.",
      "Cannon then went through hundreds of still photos he had taken that day and found another.",
      "Kevin Cannon: It's a very chilling photo. And it's the one and only photo where Jeff and Telles are in the same photo.",
      "Executive editor Glenn Cook says his staff moved forward on the operating theory that Telles \u00a0could have been the killer. But they still didn't have hard evidence.",
      "Then the police released a photo of the suspect's car: a maroon Yukon Denali.",
      "Assistant city editor David Ferrara immediately typed Telles' home address into Google Earth.",
      "David Ferrara: And if you zoom in, on the house, that maroon vehicle is there, parked in the driveway.",
      "The maroon SUV was registered to Telles' wife.",
      "Glenn Cook: And at that moment we send reporters and photographers straight to the house. And the message I give our Metro editor is, do not engage, do not approach, do not be seen. This man is very likely a suspect in the murder of your colleague, and we can't predict how he's gonna react to anyone being near him.",
      "But the photographer \u2013 crouching behind his dashboard \u2013 managed to get what he came for.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And is this the picture that is taken?",
      "Glenn Cook: That's the photo.",
      "Peter Van Sant: This is the money photo.",
      "Glenn Cook: It's the money shot.",
      "Glenn Cook: Robert Telles on a scorching hot 110-degree day is in jeans in his driveway, washing the maroon GMC Yukon Denali.",
      "Peter Van Sant: This must have been a moment where, I don't know if there's any cheering going on in your newsroom, but what a development. What does this mean?",
      "Art Kane: Well, it means that possibly Jeff was killed by the last story he wrote about. I mean, this was his last investigation and \u2014 and the suspect appears to be the guy he wrote about and basically took him out of office.",
      "Without corroboration from police documents, The Review-Journal couldn't go with the story. But Cook was betting it wouldn't be long. His reporters had seen unmarked police cars outside Robert Telles' home.",
      "Glenn Cook: We have every reason to believe at this point that it's only a matter of time before a search warrant is gonna be executed at that house.",
      "A search that will uncover crucial evidence.",
      "A STUNNING ARREST",
      "As the investigators geared up to serve Robert Telles with a search warrant, the Review-Journal needed to be sure it would be the first to break the news.",
      "Briana Erickson: It was important because Jeff was always first, and we wouldn't wanna let him down and not be the first.",
      "Glenn Cook: We polish that story \u2026 and then we sit on it until \u2026 police move in \u2026",
      "In the early morning of Sept. 7, 2022 \u2013 just five days after Jeff German's murder \u2013 Telles was brought in for questioning as police searched his home and cars. While he was in custody, detectives collected a DNA sample from Telles. They also took the jeans he was wearing into evidence and gave him a white paper suit to change into before he was taken back to his house and swarmed by reporters eagerly awaiting his arrival.",
      "Inside Telles' home, investigators say they found gym shoes and a duffel bag similar to what was seen in the surveillance video. And when they looked in the garage, detectives say they discovered even more \u2013 a straw sun hat \u2014 or what was left of it.",
      "Peter Van Sant: The sun hat.",
      "Art Kane: the sun hat.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Cut up into pieces?",
      "Art Kane: Yes. Yes.",
      "But police say the most crucial piece of evidence would come from the DNA sample that was taken from Telles earlier that day.",
      "CAPT. DORI KOREN (to reporters): We received positive DNA results that showed Robert Telles' DNA at the crime scene.",
      "Briana Erickson: Telles' DNA was under Jeff's fingernails.",
      "Glenn Cook: There's no doubt in my mind that Jeff knew exactly what was happening in that split second and he made sure he got the evidence.",
      "With a DNA match apparently secured, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department descended on Telles' home once again and began clearing the area for an arrest.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And this is where he was arrested?",
      "Kevin Cannon: Yes.",
      "Review-Journal photographer Kevin Cannon was one of dozens of media who had been waiting outside Telles' home that day.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What happens when the cops arrive?",
      "Kevin Cannon: Suddenly the police said, \"OK, everybody out.\" They kicked the entire news \u2014 everyone who was here out.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Where do you go?",
      "Kevin Cannon: So I made a B-line to the front door of a neighbor who I befriended earlier when I arrived. And they, without saying a word, opened the door and welcomed me in and walk me to their backyard where I could have a view of Telles' house.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you could still see the house from your vantage point?",
      "Kevin Cannon: From the backyard, yeah.",
      "Back in the Review-Journal newsroom, some of the staff anxiously kept up with what was happening at the scene through the office's police radio and heard that Telles refused to come out of his home.",
      "LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN POLICE RADIO: Our target is still calm on the phone. However, he has made a couple 405 comments.",
      "\"405 comments\" \u2013 a code Las Vegas police use to indicate comments associated with self-harm.",
      "Briana Erickson: it was kind of scary at that point. We were thinking, is \u2014 is this all gonna end on his terms now?",
      "LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN POLICE RADIO: ... based on the 405 comments, we are going to go ahead and make the official request for SWAT.",
      "Kevin Cannon: My colleagues \u2026 heard through the scanner that they were gonna move in because he had cut himself and they wanted to save him before he harmed himself more.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And they wanted to get to him.",
      "Kevin Cannon: Right.",
      "The SWAT team made its move. And that's when Cannon got ready.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And so you were positioned, you were ready to go then?",
      "Kevin Cannon: Right. I was ready to go the whole time. I mean, I had my finger on the button the whole time.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Where do you look, what do you see behind you?",
      "Kevin Cannon: Well, I see them rolling him out on a stretcher down \u2014 around that corner, down that path, out the driveway and put in an ambulance right here.",
      "Cannon was the only photographer that day to capture Telles' dramatic arrest. His image of Telles on the stretcher made the front page of the Review-Journal the following morning.",
      "Kevin Cannon: The next day, I, uh, opened the paper and there was a photo on the front page with a banner headline, \"Stunning Arrest.\" And \u2014 It was stunning.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And satisfying for you after all that.",
      "Kevin Cannon: Very satisfying.",
      "Art Kane: It becomes huge news, obviously all over the country.",
      "A reporter allegedly killed by a politician for a story he wrote.",
      "Art Kane: That's pretty unheard of.",
      "After Telles was treated at the hospital for his self-inflicted injuries, he was booked into the Clark County Detention Center. Six weeks later, Telles was indicted by a grand jury for murder with use of a deadly weapon.",
      "JUDGE: How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty",
      "ROBERT TELLES: Not guilty, Your Honor.",
      "Soon after, evidence from the grand jury was released by the Clark County District Court \u2014 including that grainy surveillance attack video.",
      "Art Kane: I think probably what we found, some of the most disturbing is the last three videos.",
      "Minutes later, it shows the assailant returning to the scene of the crime and parking that maroon Yukon Denali in front of Germain's driveway,",
      "Art Kane: And now you'll see him walk over and, um, make sure that Jeff is dead.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you're theorizing he is checking to see \u2026 if he's dead because obviously Jeff saw this person.",
      "Art Kane: He wants to make sure that there's not a witness that's still alive.",
      "Seemingly satisfied, the suspect walked back to his car and left.",
      "Since his arrest, Telles has been in jail awaiting trial.",
      "CONFRONTING ROBERT TELLES",
      "\"48 Hours\" met Robert Telles for a video interview at the Clark County Detention Center and began with the question on everyone's mind.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did you murder Jeff German?",
      "Robert Telles: No, sir, I did not.",
      "Peter Van Sant : If you did not commit this murder, who did?",
      "Robert Telles: I will \u2026 reserve that for trial.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You have said \u2026 that you were framed, do you stand by that in this conversation?",

They \u2014 first, they would have had to have gotten your DNA. \u2026 And then when would they have planted it under his fingernails? It seems far-fetched.",
      "Robert Telles: Well, you know, crazier things have happened, and I'll tell you that I didn't kill Mr. German.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Come on, man. That's overwhelming. \u2026 DNA ends up under his fingernails, your DNA. This is an overwhelming case against you, Robert, that you committed this murder.",
      "Robert Telles: Again, sir, you know, you have the facts wrong, and I will demonstrate it at trial.",

      "Robert Telles: Uh, no. \u2026 she was a \u2026 a confidant, um, but I'll \u2014 I'll leave it at that.",

      "According to police documents, Telles and Roberta got word the day before the murder that there was a planned release of emails and messages between her and Telles to the Review-Journal.",
      "Peter Van Sant: There was a Freedom of Information [Act] requests that Jeff had put out and you were told \u2026 that new messages and emails were gonna come out, describing the relationship between you and Roberta, communications between the two of you. And it's suggested that you made a decision to murder him to try to silence that, to prevent that from being published. What do you say about that?",
      "Robert Telles: I'm sure that's a mischaracterization of \u2014 of things. \u2026 I'll tell you that what was going to be released and I saw was going be released, um, had no inklings of \u2014 of any type of, you know, confidential relationship, any type of supposed affair. \u2026 It was all business related \u2026 So, that would not have been a motivation because there was nothing that was going to be produced that \u2014 that would look bad.",
      "Glenn Cook: Prosecutors have mentioned this as a contributing motive to the murder. In Robert Telles' mind \u2026 Jeff German ruined his marriage, ruined his political career, embarrassed him and was continuing to report on him rather than leave him alone.",

      "In life, German was known to protect his sources at all costs.",
      "In death, German was still protecting them. After the murder, the police took all his devices \u2014 which harbored the names of countless sources.",
      "The Review-Journal went to court, and in a hard-fought court case that went all the way to the Nevada Supreme Court, the paper won protection for his sources.",
      "Mark Fierro: That'll be the German rule that you will not be able to go into a reporter's files. You will not be able to go through their phone. You will not be able to look at their sources even after death.",
      "The four Jeff German sources are not about to let the world forget the reporter who fought to protect them. They have attended almost every hearing trying to come to terms with their feelings of guilt.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Because no matter what logic is in your head, it's not your fault that Jeff made his choices and that he was a professional. Your heart tells you if we wouldn't have made that call, he wouldn't have died in that violent way that day. And if I was to talk to him today, I think the first thing I would say is, \"I'm sorry.\" \u2026 But not for him, for me, because he wouldn't have accepted my apology (crying), but I need to give it.",

      "Glenn Cook: He told anyone who asked that he was never going to retire, that he was going to report until his last breath. And that's exactly what he did \u2026 And he gave his life to this job. He literally gave his life to this job. I think that's his legacy.",

    "summary": "Jeffrey Collins was one of three media witnesses for the firing squad execution of Brad Sigmon. He has been a witness to 11 South Carolina executions.",
    "story": [
      "I've now watched through glass and bars as 11 men were put to death at a South Carolina prison. None of the previous 10 prepared me for watching the\u00a0firing squad death of Brad Sigmon on Friday night.",
      "I might now be unique among U.S. reporters: I've witnessed three different methods - nine lethal injections and an electric chair execution. I can still hear the thunk of the breaker falling 21 years later.",
      "As a journalist you want to ready yourself for an assignment. You research a case. You read about the subject.",
      "In the two weeks since I knew how Sigmon was going to die, I read up on firing squads and the damage that can be done by the bullets. I looked at the autopsy photos of the last man shot to death by the state, in Utah in 2010.",
      "I also pored over the transcript of his trial, including how prosecutors said it took less than two minutes for Sigmon to strike his ex-girlfriend's parents nine times each in the head with a baseball bat, going back and forth between them in different rooms of their Greenville County home in 2001 until they were dead.",
      "But you don't know everything when some of execution protocols are kept secret, and it's impossible to know what to expect when you've never seen someone shot at close range right in front of you.",
      "The\u00a0firing squad\u00a0is certainly faster - and more violent - than lethal injection. It's a lot more tense, too. My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon's lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon's head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.",
      "About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.",
      "It reminded me of what happened to the prisoner 21 years ago when electricity jolted his body.",
      "I tried to keep track, all at once, of the digital clock on the wall to my right, Sigmon to my left, the small, rectangular window with the shooters and the witnesses in front of me.",
      "A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.",
      "A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08 p.m.",
      "Then we left through the same door we came in.",
      "The sun was setting. The sky was a pretty pink and purple, a stark contrast to the death chamber's florescent lights, gray firing squad chair and block walls that reminded me of a 1970s doctor's office.",
      "The death chamber is less than a five-minute drive from Correction Department headquarters along a busy suburban highway. I always look out the window on the drive back from each execution. There is a pasture with cows behind a fence on one side, and on the other, I can see in the distance the razor wire of the prison.",
      "Armed prison employees were everywhere. We sat in vans outside the death chamber for what I guess was around 15 minutes, but I can't say for certain because my watch, cellphone and everything else was taken away for security, save for a pad and a pen.",
      "Over to my right, I saw the skinny, barred windows of South Carolina's death row. There were 28 inmates there earlier Friday, and now there are 27.",
      "That's down from 31 last August. After a 13-year pause while South Carolina struggled to obtain the drugs for lethal injections, the state has resumed executions. Inmates may choose between injections, electrocution or the firing squad.",
      "I witnessed Freddie Owens being put to death Sept. 20. He locked eyes with every witness in the room.",
      "I saw Richard Moore die Nov. 1, looking serenely at the celling as his lawyer, who became close to him while fighting for his life over a decade, wept.",
      "And I was there, too, when Marion Bowman Jr. died Jan. 31, a small smile on his face as he turned to his lawyer, then closed his eyes and waited.",
      "I remember other executions too. I've seen family members of victims stare down a killer on the gurney. I've seen a mother shed tears as she watched her son die, almost close enough to touch if the glass and bars weren't in the way.",
      "Like that thunk of the breaker back in 2004, I won't forget the crack of the rifles Friday and that target disappearing. Also etched in my mind: Sigmon talking or mouthing toward his lawyer, trying to let him know he was OK before the hood went on.",
      "I'll likely be back at Broad River Correctional Institution on April 11. Two more men on death row are out of appeals, and the state Supreme Court appears ready to schedule their deaths at five-week intervals.",
      "They would be the 12th and 13th men I've seen killed by the state of South Carolina. And when it is over, I will have witnessed more than a quarter of the state's executions since the death penalty was reinstated.",
      "----",

    "summary": "Betsy Arakawa died from hantavirus days before her husband, actor Gene Hackman, died of heart disease, New Mexico officials said.",
    "story": [
      "New Mexico officials announced the cause of death Friday for actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa weeks after the couple was found dead at their home in Santa Fe.",
      "The pair died within days of each other\u00a0and there were no apparent signs of foul play, New Mexico Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said at a news conference. Their bodies were discovered on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman, 95, likely died on Feb. 18, from heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, officials said after medical investigators performed autopsies.",
      "His wife, 65, likely died about a week before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare disease often spread by rodents in the Southwest. She was last known alive on Feb. 11, investigators said.",
      "There were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024, according to state health officials.",
      "What is hantavirus pulmonary syndrome?",
      "Hantaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause rare but potentially deadly illnesses.",
      "There are many different types of hantaviruses worldwide.",
      "\"These viruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans,\" Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department said at Friday's news conference.",
      "Hantaviruses can cause two syndromes: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, known as HPS, or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, also known as HFRS,\u00a0according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "HFRS is found mostly in Europe and Asia, the CDC said, while HPS is found in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States.",
      "Hantaviruses have been found throughout New Mexico, primarily in deer mice, but in other rodents as well.",
      "\"A small number of human infections are found every year in New Mexico,\" said Phipps.",
      "Between one and seven cases have been confirmed annually in the state over the past five years, she said. There have been 136 infections confirmed statewide over the past 50 years, with five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease,\" Phipps said, adding that 42% of the infections in New Mexico were fatal.",
      "There is no current specific treatment to cure hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.",
      "How does hantavirus pulmonary syndrome spread?",
      "The virus is spread in the U.S. through rodents, primarily through deer mice and other similar mice.",
      "The CDC started monitoring hantavirus in 1993 after an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in the Four Corners region \u2014 the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet. As of 2022, there had been 864 cases of hantavirus disease\u00a0reported in the U.S. since surveillance began, according to the CDC.",
      "The virus is not spread from person-to-person, but from animals to humans.",
      "Hantavirus can be transmitted from rodent dropping, urine and saliva. An infected person can get HPS by breathing in the virus, the New Mexico health department said, and this happens when droppings or urine containing the virus is stirred up in the air as mist or dust. It could also spread if someone touches their eyes, nose, or mouth after they have touched droppings or dust that contains the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "People can also get hantavirus from a mouse bite, but this is rare, the New Mexico health department said.",
      "Most transmissions occur around the resident's home or workplace. On March 5, New Mexico health officials conducted an inspection of the Hackman's property, said Phipps. Signs of rodent entry were found on structures on the Hackman's property, but not in the main residence, officials said.",
      "What are the symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome?",
      "Hantavirus infections can initially cause flu-like symptoms that last roughly three to six days. An infected person can suffer from fever, muscle aches, coughs and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea.",
      "These symptoms can sometimes progress to shortness of breath, heart and lung failure, said Jarrell. This can occur anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries hantavirus, she said.",
      "The CDC says early symptoms can include:",

      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 07:00:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers are discovering that \"springing ahead\" each March for daylight saving time is connected with serious negative health effects.",
    "story": [
      "Beth Ann Malow\u00a0is a professor of neurology and pediatrics at Vanderbilt University.",
      "As people in the U.S. prepare to turn their clocks ahead one hour in mid-March, I find myself bracing for the annual ritual of media stories about the disruptions to daily routines caused by switching from standard time to daylight saving time.",
      "About a third of Americans say they don't look forward to these twice-yearly time changes. An overwhelming 63% to 16% majority would like to eliminate them completely.",
      "But the effects go beyond simple inconvenience. Researchers are discovering that \"springing ahead\" each March is connected with serious negative health effects.",
      "I'm a professor of neurology and pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and the director of our sleep division. In a 2020 commentary for the journal JAMA Neurology, my co-authors and I reviewed the evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to increased strokes, heart attacks and teen sleep deprivation.",
      "Based on an extensive body of research, my colleagues and I believe that the science establishing these links is strong and that the evidence makes a good case for adopting permanent standard time nationwide \u2013 as I testified at a recent Congressional hearing.",
      "Missing sleep, worse health",
      "\"Falling back\" \u2013 going from daylight saving time to standard time each November by turning the clocks back one hour \u2013 is relatively benign. While some people may feel thrown off balance and need a few weeks to recover, research hasn't linked it to serious impacts on health.",
      "Springing forward is harder on the body, however. This is because our clock time is moved an hour later; in other words, it feels like 7 a.m. even though our clocks say it is 8 a.m. So it's a permanent shift to later morning light for almost eight months \u2013 not just for the day of the change or a few weeks afterward. This is particularly notable because morning light is valuable for helping to set the body's natural rhythms: It wakes us up and improves alertness.",
      "Although the exact reasons are not yet known, this may be due to light's effects on increasing levels of cortisol, a hormone that modulates the stress response or the effect of light on the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in emotions.",
      "In contrast, exposure to light later into the evening delays the brain's release of melatonin, the hormone that promotes drowsiness. This can interfere with sleep and cause us to sleep less overall, and the effect can last even after most people adjust to losing an hour of sleep at the start of daylight saving time.",
      "Because puberty also causes melatonin to be released later at night, meaning that teenagers have a delay in the natural signal that helps them fall asleep, adolescents are particularly susceptible to sleep problems from the extended evening light of daylight saving time. This shift in melatonin during puberty lasts into our 20s.",
      "Adolescents also may be chronically sleep deprived due to school, sports and social activity schedules. For instance, many children start school around 8 a.m. or earlier. This means that during daylight saving time, many young people get up and travel to school in pitch darkness.",
      "The \"western edge\" effect",
      "Geography can also make a difference in how daylight saving time affects people. One study showed that people living on the western edge of a time zone, who get light later in the morning and light later in the evening, got less sleep than their counterparts on the eastern edge of a time zone.",
      "This study found that western edge residents had higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer, as well as lower per capita income and higher health care costs. Other research has found that rates of certain other cancers are higher on the western edge of a time zone.",
      "Scientists believe that these health problems may result from a combination of chronic sleep deprivation and \"circadian misalignment\". Circadian misalignment refers to a mismatch in timing between our biological rhythms and the outside world. In other words, the timing of daily work, school or sleep routines is based on the clock, rather than on the sun's rise and set.",
      "A brief history of daylight saving time",
      "Congress instituted daylight saving time during World War I and again during World War II, and once again during the energy crisis of the early 1970s. The idea was that having extra light later into the afternoon would save energy by decreasing the need for electric lighting. This idea has since been proved largely inaccurate, as heating needs may increase in the morning in the winter, while air conditioning needs can also increase in the late afternoon in the summer.",
      "Another pro-daylight saving argument has been that crime rates drop with more light at the end of the day. While this has been proved true, the change is very small, and the health effects appear to outweigh the lower rates of crime.",
      "After World War II, it was left to state governments to set the start and end dates for daylight saving time. Because this created many railroad scheduling and safety problems, however, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966. This law set the nationwide dates of daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October.",
      "In 2007, Congress amended the Uniform Time Act to expand daylight saving time from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, dates that remain in effect today.",
      "The law allows states and territories to opt out of daylight saving time, however. Arizona and Hawaii are on permanent standard time, along with Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and American Samoa. Now, many other states are considering whether to stop falling back and springing ahead.",
      "The question then becomes: Should they pick permanent daylight saving time or permanent standard time?",
      "The strong case for permanent standard time",
      "Americans are split on whether they prefer permanent daylight saving time or permanent standard time. However, my colleagues and I believe that the health-related science for establishing permanent standard time is strong.",
      "Standard time most closely approximates natural light, with the sun directly overhead at or near noon. In contrast, during daylight saving time from March until November, the natural light is shifted unnaturally by one hour later.",
      "Based on abundant evidence that daylight saving time is unnatural and unhealthy, I believe we should abolish daylight saving time and adopt permanent standard time.",

      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Mr. Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told CBS News that Ukrainians brought the pause in U.S. intelligence sharing \"on themselves.\"",
      "It's \"sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said of the impact of the intelligence pause on the battlefield. \"Got their attention.\"",

      "A statement from the prime minister's office gave no details except to say it had \"accepted the invitation of U.S.-backed mediators.\" Saturday's announcement comes as the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip is perilously close to collapsing as both Israel and Hamas have both balked at entering negotiations over terms of an intended second phase of the deal. Talks on the second phase should have started a month ago.",
      "Meanwhile, food shortages in the territory have become acute and Palestinians living there are again struggling to feed their families.",
      "The ceasefire that began in mid-January brought a pause in Israel's campaign of bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The ceasefire's first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the freeing of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.",
      "But the intended second phase of the deal \u2013 meant to bring the release of the remaining hostages and a lasting truce and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2013 has been thrown into doubt. Israel has called for Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in return for an extension of the ceasefire and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",
      "Since March 2, Israel has barred all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies from entering Gaza for some 2 million people, demanding Hamas accept the revised deal.",

      "\"We ask the world to help us to stop the war,\" Mustafa said. \"We have had enough suffering.\"",
      "Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces have pulled back to a zone along Gaza's edges. Early Saturday, an Israeli strike killed two Palestinians in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said it struck several men who appeared to have been flying a drone that entered Israel from Gaza.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The campaign was triggered by Hamas' October 2023 terrorist attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 34 others.",

      "Women across the world will call for equal pay, reproductive rights, education, justice and decision-making jobs during demonstrations marking International Women's Day on Saturday.",
      "Officially recognized by the United Nations in 1977, International Women's Day is commemorated in different ways and to varying degrees in places around the world. Protests are often political - and at times violent - rooted in women's efforts to improve their rights as workers.",
      "Demonstrations are planned from Tokyo to Mexico City, and this year's global theme is \"Accelerate Action,\" coming at a moment where many activists worry that the current political environment may result in a backsliding on many of the rights they've long fought for. One in four countries reported a backlash against women's rights last year, according to U.N. data.",
      "Here is what to know about the March 8 global event:",
      "International Women's Day is a global celebration - and a call to action - marked by demonstrations, mostly of women, around the world, ranging from combative protests to charity runs. Some celebrate the economic, social and political achievements of women, while others urge governments to guarantee equal pay, access to health care, justice for victims of gender-based violence and education for girls.",
      "It is an official holiday in more than 20 countries, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ukraine, Russia and Cuba, the only one in the Americas.",
      "As in other aspects of life, social media plays an important role during International Women's Day, particularly by amplifying attention to demonstrations held in countries with repressive governments toward women and dissent in general.",
      "While the idea behind a women's day originated in the U.S. with the American Socialist Party in 1909, it was a German feminist who pushed for a global commemoration during an international conference of socialist women held in 1910 in Copenhagen. The following year, events across Europe marked the day, and during World War I, women used it to protest the armed conflict, which lasted from 1914 to 1918.",
      "International Women's Day is observed on March 8 after a massive protest in Russia on Feb. 23, 1917, that led to the country's eventual withdrawal from the war. At the time, Russia had not adopted the Gregorian calendar and still used the Julian calendar.",
      "\"On Feb. 23 in Russia, which was March 8 in Western Europe, women went out on the streets and protested for bread and peace,\" said Kristen Ghodsee, professor and chair of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The authorities weren't able to stop them, and then, once the men saw that the women were out on the streets, all of the workers started coming and joining the women.\"",
      "The U.N. began commemorating the holiday in 1975, which was International Women's Year, and its General Assembly officially recognized the day two years later.",
      "Women in Eastern Europe have long received flowers on March 8 - and sometimes even gotten the day off from work. But chocolates and candy can come across as belittling gestures, showing a lack of understanding of the struggles driving women to protest, particularly in regions where protests have been combative.",
      "In Turkey, women in 2023 braved an official ban on an International Women's Day march in Istanbul, and protested for about two hours before police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and detain dozens of people.",
      "In Mexico, which hosts one of the region's biggest marches, celebrations this year are marked by sharp contrasts. While the country celebrates its first female president, many also mourn victims of stark violence against women - including femicide. In Mexico and Latin America, soaring rates of violence against women and persistent machismo often leave tension simmering on March 8 as protesters demand justice.",
      "Globally, a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a family member or partner, according to U.N. figures, and women being exposed to conflict has significantly jumped over the past decade.",
      "Ghodsee said commemorating International Women's Day is now more important than ever, as women have lost gains made in the last century, chief among them the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a nationwide right to abortion, which ended constitutional protections that had been in place nearly 50 years."

The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties.",

      "In a statement distributed by his lawyers, Yoon said that he \"appreciates the courage and decision by the Seoul Central District Court to correct illegality,\" in an apparent reference to legal disputes over his arrest. He said he also thanks his supporters and asked those who are on hunger strike against his impeachment to end it.",
      "Yoon was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into huge political turmoil. The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.",
      "The Constitutional Court has been deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. If the court upholds his impeachment, a national election will be held to find his successor within two months.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said Friday it accepted Yoon's request to be released from prison, citing the need to address questions over the legality of the investigations on the president. Yoon's lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to probe rebellion charges.",
      "The Seoul court also said the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.",
      "Yoon's release came after prosecutors decided not to appeal the decision by the Seoul court. South Korean law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect while pursuing an appeal, even after his or her arrest is canceled by a court.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led Yoon's Dec. 14 impeachment, lashed out at the prosecutors' decision, calling them \"henchmen\" of Yoon, a former prosecutor general. Party spokesperson Cho Seung-rae urged the Constitutional Court to dismiss Yoon as soon as possible to avoid further public unrest and anxiety.",
      "At the heart of public criticism of Yoon over his martial law decree was his dispatch of hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly after placing the country under military rule. Some senior military and police officials sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to pull out lawmakers to thwart a parliamentary vote on the decree. Yoon has countered that he aimed to maintain order.",
      "Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted unanimously to overturn Yoon's decree.",
      "Investigators have alleged Yoon's martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he's convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that doesn't cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.",
      "Yoon has said he didn't intend to maintain martial law for long as he only attempted to inform the public of the danger of the Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda and impeached many senior officials and prosecutors. In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the assembly \"a den of criminals\" and \"anti-state forces.\"",
      "South Korea's conservative-liberal divide is severe, and rallies either supporting or denouncing Yoon's impeachment have divided Seoul streets. Experts say whatever decision the Constitutional Court makes, the division is certain to worsen.",

    "story": [
      "State Department staff were taken aback this week by a department directive instructing embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality monitoring data.",
      "CBS News has reviewed the message that was sent to staff on March 4, which says \"currently there is no anticipated date for real-time data to be available.\" Embassy staff and their families relied on the reports to alert them to poor air quality days.",
      "\"I was shocked by the announcement,\" said a current staffer, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about their job, and who said the decision doesn't make much sense as the existing infrastructure to monitor air quality is already in place and operational. \"I don't see any purpose in turning off this data, it doesn't make any sense,\" said another department employee.",
      "A State Department spokesman told CBS News in a statement that the air quality monitors are running, but the effort to transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates is no longer happening \"due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network.\" When asked what it costs to operate the program, the State Department did not provide an answer.",
      "\"The cost to maintain these systems is trivial,\" said Rick Duke, who served as the deputy special envoy for climate at the State Department until January and believes this isn't about saving money as much as it's driven by misplaced anti-climate ideology in the Trump administration. \"These monitors aren't even about climate,\" said Duke, \"Why take away health information from embassy staff and the public?\"",
      "Air monitoring at U.S. embassies began informally in 2008 when a single monitor was placed at the embassy in Beijing, China. The results were posted hourly on Twitter, informing the public about levels of air pollution in the city. The account called\u00a0AirBeijing became internet-famous in 2010 when it tweeted that the air on Nov. 11 was \"Crazy Bad\" when the machine registered dangerously high levels of air pollution.",
      "The purpose behind the monitoring was to inform U.S. citizens living in the region about the state of the city's air, but the Chinese public quickly picked up the information and began demanding their government address the toxic pollution that local officials often downplayed.",
      "The State Department expanded air monitoring at other embassies around the world, installing 78 monitors elsewhere, and made the data available on AirNow.gov. A 2022 scientific study found that the embassy program was highly successful in reducing air pollutants, \"resulting in substantial decreases in the premature mortality risk faced by the over 300 million people living in cities home to a US embassy monitor.\"",
      "But now that the program is terminated, the webpage for embassy data only produces an error message. The last available reading in Beijing was posted on March 4, the day the agency stopped transmitting data.",
      "Current State Department staff told CBS News that access to air quality data is key when weighing overseas assignments, especially for those who must move their entire family and children to places with unhealthy air, or in locations where air monitoring by local governments is unreliable or non-existent.",
      "\"Robbing employees of the information they need for the health decisions of their children is immoral,\" said a current staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the air data continues to be collected and \"will be made available when there is a secure and reliable way to transmit it.\" They said the department is \"evaluating other transmission options.\"",
      "The spokesperson also said the air quality monitoring equipment \"is only one of a number of tools the Department uses to ensure the health and safety of our staff.\"",
      "When CBS News asked staffers about the other tools, they said they were not aware of any and did not know how else to access the information.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. State Department updated its travel advisory for the popular Caribbean tourist destination Turks and Caicos Islands this week to include a warning about the territory's laws against firearms and ammunition.",
      "A British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic, Turks and Caicos consists\u00a0of eight major islands, with the majority of its population living on the main island, Providenciales.",
      "Here's what to know about the warning and how the State Department issues travel advisories.",
      "Turks and Caicos travel advisory",
      "The State Department's\u00a0travel advisory for Turks and Caicos Islands is a Level 2, advising Americans to exercise increased caution if they visit. It has been listed as a Level 2 nation for multiple years.",
      "The primary reason for the Level 2 advisory is crime in that country, the State Department says. The warning says most crime happens on the island of Providenciales.",
      "\"Police may have limited investigatory resources,\" the advisory says.",
      "An update on March 4 added a warning on the country's strict laws prohibiting firearms and ammunition, including single bullets that may be brought by mistake.",
      "\"Police strictly enforce these laws, even at the airport when travelers are leaving,\" the advisory says. \"Travelers face arrest, jail time, and heavy fines.\"",
      "Multiple Americans were arrested on the islands in 2024 for possessing ammunition and faced possible prison sentences of 12 years or more. After often months-long ordeals, they were released on suspended sentences and ordered to pay fines.",
      "What are the State Department's travel advisory levels and what do they mean?",
      "The State Department has four levels of travel advisories:",
      "Level 1: Exercise normal precautionsLevel 2: Exercise increased cautionLevel 3: Reconsider travelLevel 4: Do not travel",
      "Level 1: Exercise normal precautions",
      "Level 2: Exercise increased caution",
      "Level 3: Reconsider travel",
      "Level 4: Do not travel",
      "The agency issues travel advisories for every country in the world. Factors considered in setting advisory levels include crime, terrorism, civil unrest, the risk of wrongful detention, health, the likelihood of a natural disaster and current events, the State Department says.",
      "Level 1 is the lowest advisory and indicates there is some risk in any international travel. Level 2 means there are \"heightened risks to safety and security,\" which could apply to specific areas of the country.",
      "Level 3 advises Americans to reconsider traveling to the nation because of \"serious risks to safety and security.\" Level 4 is the highest advisory level indicating there is a \"greater likelihood of life-threatening risks.\" The department advises Americans to write a will and leave DNA samples if they decide to travel to a Level 4 nation in preparation for possible worst-case scenarios.",
      "Some nations could have multiple levels, with parts of the country more of a concern. For example, the advisory for Mexico, as of March 7, has specific levels for each state within the country, ranging from Level 1 to Level 4.",
      "In each advisory, the State Department explains the factors contributing to the level designation, identifies possible areas of more risk and gives advice on what to do if you decide to travel to that country.",
      "Examples of countries with each travel advisory level",
      "Here are examples of countries in each advisory level, as of March 7:",
      "Level 1: Canada, Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Argentina and multiple Caribbean islands, including Aruba and St. Lucia, are among the Level 1 countries.",
      "Level 2: Popular European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany, have Level 2 advisories. Other examples are mainland China, South Africa, Morocco, Peru and The Bahamas.",
      "Level 3: Countries with Level 3 advisories include Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala and Jamaica. Most of the Level 3 nations include specific higher risk areas that the State Department says to avoid.",
      "Level 4: The State Department has designated more than a dozen nations as Level 4, advising Americans not to travel to them. They include Russia and Ukraine due to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Others at Level 4 include Syria, Iraq, Sudan and South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "How often does the State Department review travel advisories?",
      "The State Department says it reviews Level 1 and 2 travel advisories at least every 12 months and Level 3 and 4 advisories at least every six months.",
      "\"A Travel Advisory will also be updated anytime there is a change in U.S. government posture, normally as it relates to ongoing security concerns,\" the department says.",
      "How to look up travel advisories around the world",
      "Americans can find a searchable list of the State Department's travel advisories on the agency's website. There is also an updating map that provides a visual display of the advisories around the world.",

In the interview, Mr. Trump said he sent the letter \"yesterday,\" but the exact timing remained unclear.",
      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said in a clip from the interview, which was shared by the network ahead of its full airing this weekend, Fox said.",

Mr. Trump imposed a wide range of new sanctions on Iran at the time, calling it a policy of \"maximum pressure\" to force Tehran to broker a new deal. That policy has decimated Iran's economy, but there have been no new negotiations between the two sides acknowledged publicly since.",
      "Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "The most recent IAEA report found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity \u2014 much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report.",

      "The three, who were tangled in sexual relationships with one of their handlers or each other, denied being in on the plot and claimed they didn't know who they were working for or were lied to by their superiors.",
      "Their plans were laid out in thousands of messages exchanged between the cell's leaders and recovered by police, the BBC reported. The messages included plots to kidnap and kill some of the group's targets as well as plans to ensnare them in so-called \"honeytrap\" romances.",
      "Prosecutors said they spied on a U.S. air base in Germany where Ukrainian troops were said to be training, and had discussed kidnapping or killing opponents of the Russian state.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:55:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Asked about NATO Article 5 commitment, Trump says U.S. \"not going to defend\" allies that fail to meet his spending requirements.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",
      "\"Do you think they're going to come and protect us? Hmm. They're supposed to. I'm not so sure,\" Mr. Trump said as he addressed reporters at the Oval Office.",
      "He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",
      "More than 7,000 members of the U.S. armed forces were killed during that same period, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.",
      "President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.",
      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, also announced a plan this week to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in extra spending on defense and infrastructure should he take office.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came at the end of a week in which his administration ruffled European feathers by appearing to question the contributions of America's NATO allies.",
      "In pointed comments on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron said France and the U.S. were \"loyal and faithful allies,\" and that France had \"respect and friendship\" for the United States.",
      "\"I think we're entitled to expect the same,\" Macron said",
      "Vance irks U.K. and France with remark he claims wasn't aimed at them",
      "In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Vice President JD Vance appeared to diminish the value of military contributions by key U.S. allies \u2014 both past and future \u2014 while discussing the proposed minerals deal between Ukraine and the U.S.",
      "Vance said the potential economic deal, which the White House has pushed Kyiv hard to sign, \"is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\"",
      "Those comments sparked outrage from politicians in France and the U.K. \u2014 the only two countries that have thus far said they might send troops to help maintain peace under a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "While Vance later appeared to walk his remarks back on social media, saying that both countries had, \"fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years\" and that he did not \"even mention the UK or France\" in the interview, the diplomatic damage was done.",
      "France's far right leader Marine Le Pen condemned Vance's comments, defending the \"noble memory\" of French troops and saying that \"no patriot will therefore allow it to be said that our country is ordinary.\"",
      "U.K. Member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, a former British Army officer who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told CBS News' partner network BBC News on Tuesday, \"the disrespect shown by the new US vice-president to the sacrifices of our service personnel is unacceptable.\"",

    "summary": "Pope Francis, 88, has been in a Rome hospital for 3 weeks, but he was well enough as he recovers from pneumonia to record a first message for his supporters.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 The voice of Pope Francis was heard by the public on Thursday night for the first time since he was admitted to a hospital three weeks earlier. The message was recorded from the 88-year-old pope's room at the Gemelli Polyclinic hospital in Rome, according to the Vatican.",
      "\"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square,\" Francis said in the message played out to those who have been praying for him in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "That Francis was able to speak to record the message was an encouraging sign, but his frailty could be heard in the recording. Francis' voice sounded weak and breathless.",
      "The pope was admitted on February 14 with a bad case of bronchitis that devolved into bilateral pneumonia, or pneumonia in both lungs. It would be a serious prognosis for anyone, but especially for someone of the pope's age \u2014 and even more so for a man who had part of one lung removed due to a respiratory infection as a young man in his home country of Argentina.",
      "In a clear setback, the Vatican said Francis suffered two episodes of acute respiratory failure on Monday. At one point, doctors had to intervene by aspirating mucus from his airways. He's been alternating between high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation since then and, according to the Vatican's twice-daily updates, resting well.",
      "Francis has been adamant about sharing an unprecedented level of detail when it comes to his health, going against centuries of secrecy surrounding pontiffs as they near the end of their lives \u2014 as well as the old Italian adage that \"a pope is always well until he dies.\"",
      "The Vatican said again Friday morning that Francis' condition was stable, but that his prognosis remained \"guarded,\" meaning he's still deemed to be in danger.",
      "The pope has been able to undergo physical therapy, both in the form of breathing exercises and for his mobility. The Vatican has consistently reported on his ability to get out of bed, sit in a chair, read daily newspapers and carry out many of his official duties from his hospital room.",
      "Several times during this hospitalization \u2014 which has been the longest of the four during his papacy \u2014 the Vatican has commented on the pope making phone calls to the Catholic community in the war-torn Gaza Strip. He has spoken regularly with the parish there since the war was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "For three Sundays in a row, the pontiff has been absent from his Angelus appearances in St. Peter's Square. His audio message came a day after Ash Wednesday, marking the start of the Lenten season leading up to Easter.",
      "For two weeks, Cardinals have been leading nightly recitations of the Rosary to pray for the ailing pontiff. Vatican sources tell CBS News that it is premature to say when Francis might be discharged from the hospital.",
      "The Vatican announced weeks ago that Francis would not be celebrating this year's Easter Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica this year, due to his ongoing recovery.",

      "Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of \u2018My Mother and I,\u2019 discusses how the Duchess of Sussex isn't going to be welcomed back across the pond anytime soon after her royal exit.",
      "Meghan Markle's new Netflix lifestyle show, \"With Love, Meghan,\" has been widely panned by critics.",
      "The 43-year-old Duchess of Sussex's series, which premiered March 4, sits at a dismal 33% on Rotten Tomatoes' Tomatometer.",
      "In the show, Markle shared her favorite cooking recipes and hosting tips while joined by some of her famous friends, including Mindy Kaling, former \"Suits\" co-star Abigail Spencer, Argentine influencer Delfina Blaquier and celebrity chefs Roy Choi and Alice Waters.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, Kinsey Schofield, host of the \"To Di For Daily\" podcast, explained why she believes \"With Love, Meghan\" missed the mark.",
      "MEGHAN MARKLE CORRECTS MINDY KALING AFTER AWKWARD SLIP-UP IN NETFLIX SERIES: \u2018YOU KNOW I\u2019M SUSSEX NOW\u2019",
      "\"Meghan needs to elevate the people around her instead of hijacking all the oxygen in the room,\" Schofield said.",
      "Meghan Markle's new Netflix show, \"With Love, Meghan,\" has been poorly received by critics. (Netflix)",
      "\"She appears totally self-consumed and tone deaf,\" Schofield added. \"You're standing next to Mindy Kaling, and you're not asking her how she built her girl boss empire? Why?\"",
      "After rising to fame when she starred in the hit NBC sitcom \"The Office,\" Kaling, 45, founded her production company, Kaling International, in 2012. Through Kaling International, Kaling has created and produced a number of successful television series, including \"The Mindy Project,\" \"Never Have I Ever\" and \"The Sex Lives of College Girls.\"",
      "Kaling is the creator and showrunner of her company's most recent project, Netflix's TV show \"Running Point,\" which stars Kate Hudson. The sports comedy premiered on the streaming platform Feb. 27 and debuted at No. 3 on Netflix's Top 10 Shows in the U.S.",
      "The six-time Emmy Award winner joined Markle in the second episode of \"With Love, Meghan\" during which they teamed up to host a children's garden tea party. According to Markle, the two have been \"email pen pals\" since Kaling appeared on her \"Archetypes\" podcast in 2022.",
      "Shortly after the show's premiere, the episode went viral for a moment when Markle corrected Kaling when the comedian referred to the duchess by her maiden name.",
      "Royal expert Kinsey Schofield suggested Markle should \"elevate\" the guests on the show rather than \"hijacking all the oxygen in the room.\" (Netflix)",
      "\"It\u2019s so funny, too, that you keep saying Meghan Markle,\" Markle said. \"You know I\u2019m Sussex now.\"",
      "Schofield noted how the viral exchange highlighted points that other reviewers made in their criticism of \"With Love, Meghan.\" The show, which Markle chose to film at a rented estate in Montecito, California, instead of her own home nearby, has been critiqued for lacking authenticity.",
      "\"Meghan lacks humility or an ounce of authenticity.\" Schofield said. \"It\u2019s a blatantly obvious PR exercise that does not give us a glimpse of Meghan\u2019s real world. She\u2019s doing random arts and crafts in someone else's house with people she claims are her very best friends but doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re left-handed or allergic to peanut butter? Your \u2018girl\u2019 Mindy doesn\u2019t know your last name is Sussex?",
      "\"It\u2019s such a painful farce,\" Schofield added. \"Her 'hacks' are common knowledge, and her definition of 'elevating' equals wasting 60 pounds of fruit and tracing lines on your paper menu with a pencil so you can erase them later.\"",
      "Markle and Kaling had an awkward exchange on the show that later went viral. (Netflix)",
      "Royal photographer Helena Chard agreed that Markle's show would have had more resonance with audiences if she had used the opportunity to authentically connect with her guests and showcase her real personality.",
      "\"As far as I see, Meghan lacks charisma and connection with her guests and audience,\" Chard told Fox News Digital. \"Her guests, however, glorify Meghan, putting her on a pedestal. It would do Meghan\u2019s character wonders if she changed things up by focusing and lifting her guests for a change.\"",
      "Chard pointed out that audiences in the United Kingdom may not be familiar with some of the guests on \"With Love, Meghan\" and \"to find out more about them would add a special touch.\"",
      "The royal expert described Markle's cooking and hosting tips and tricks as \"unoriginal and basic.\"",
      "\"The production sadly feels bland, staged and stilted,\" Chard added. \"Netflix [has] shot a glossy production focusing on Meghan. The hope is the series will show Meghan in a new light, rehabilitate her image and change public perception.",
      "\"The truth is people want to see more raw fun moments, not staged aspirational content,\" she explained. \"A fun, authentic personality full of heart resonates far more with the public and would give Meghan far more kudos.\"",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" has been criticized for lacking authenticity. (Netflix)",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" was originally scheduled to be released in January, but its debut was delayed due to the Los Angeles fires. The lifestyle show is the latest project to originate from the multiyear deal Markle and husband Prince Harry made with Netflix in 2020. The streamer announced Friday that \"With Love, Meghan\" will premiere its second season this fall and that the episodes have already been shot.",
      "In December 2024, Netflix released Harry's five-part documentary project, \"Polo,\" which followed professional polo players as they compete in the U.S. Open Polo Championship during the 2024 season. Harry and Meghan made brief appearances in the docuseries when the duke competed in a charity polo match.",
      "\"Polo\" was also met with mostly negative reviews after its release. Royal expert Hilary Fordwich drew comparisons between \"Polo\" and \"With Love, Meghan,\" telling Fox News Digital the shows were poorly received for similar reasons.",
      "The show is the latest project from Markle and Harry's deal with Netflix. (Netflix)",
      "\"Most unfortunately, just like Harry\u2019s Netflix flop \u2018Polo\u2019, amongst the plethora of reasons why ratings are so low and critics have savaged [Markle]\u2019s is due to lack of authenticity, being a tone-deaf portrayal of privileged self-important people,\" Fordwich said.",
      "\"Neither Netflix show has resonated with audiences. Both have been universally derided,\" she added.",
      "Fordwich cited the shows' low ranking scores from users on IMDb, where \"Polo\" holds an audience score of three out of 10 and \"With Love, Meghan\" notched a score of 2.7 out of 10.",
      "\"Both sets of low ratings are devastating as Netflix doesn\u2019t invest to reap such lackluster ratings,\" Fordwich said.",
      "Fordwich referred to an Instagram post Markle shared to promote \"With Love, Meghan\" ahead of its release. On Tuesday, Markle uploaded a carousel of images taken during the show's production, writing \"Today is the day! A few BTS snaps + food pictures I took on set for \u2018With Love, Meghan.\u2019 Come join the party on @netflix!\"",
      "Markle celebrated as the show entered Netflix's Top 10 within 24 hours of its release. (Netflix)",
      "\"It\u2019s not exactly begging, but [Markle] has encouraged fans to \u2018Come join the party,\u2019 perhaps due to the ghastly ratings?\" Fordwich said.",
      "Despite the show's negative reviews, Markle celebrated its streaming success in a post she shared on her Instagram story Wednesday.",
      "\"For more recipes, fun, and reasons to \u2018Mmmm\u2019, check out the show \u2014 which in just 24 hours is already in the Top 10!\" the duchess wrote underneath a promo for \"With Love, Meghan.\"",
      "\"Thank you to all of you around the world who are tuning in!\"",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" held the No. 6 spot on Netflix's Top 10 Wednesday and climbed to No. 5 by Thursday. However, as of Friday, the show moved to No. 7 on the streaming platform's Top 10.",

      "As measles cases continue to emerge in several U.S. states, treatment and prevention is top of mind.",
      "As most infected individuals have been unvaccinated, school-aged children, U.S. health agencies have stressed the importance of receiving two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent the disease.",

      "WATCH FULL INTERVIEW WITH DR. MARC SIEGEL AND RFK JR. ON FOX NATION",
      "Kennedy noted that while there is no approved antiviral for measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement last week supporting the administration of vitamin A under physician supervision as supportive care.",
      "Previous research published in the International Journal of Epidemiology has shown that vitamin A, in conjunction with the measles vaccine, can be an effective intervention in preventing measles mortality in children.",
      "Kennedy reiterated the importance of maintaining good nutrition and consuming various vitamins \u2014 like A, B12, C, D and E \u2014 as the \"best defense against\" chronic and infectious illness.",
      "\"Vitamin A can be helpful as part of a broader treatment protocol, especially in areas where children are deficient.\"",
      "While studies have suggested that vitamin A can help fight a measles infection, Neil Maniar, PhD, MPH, professor of public health practice at Northeastern University in Boston, reiterated that it does not prevent the disease.",
      "\"The two-dose MMR vaccine is our safest and most effective tool to prevent this highly contagious illness,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "The CDC recommends daily doses of vitamin A at 50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months of age, 100,000 IU for infants 6 to 11 months of age, and 200,000 IU for children 12 months of age and older. (iStock)",
      "\"Vitamin A can be helpful as part of a broader treatment protocol, especially in areas where children are deficient.\"",

      "RFK RECOMMENDS MEASLES VACCINES FOR COMMUNITY IMMUNITY WHILE SUPPORTING PERSONAL CHOICE",
      "\"For children who are diagnosed with both measles and vitamin A deficiency, receiving age-appropriate doses of vitamin A may reduce the likelihood of progression to severe illness or death,\" he added.",
      "The expert warned that vitamin A can be harmful in high doses, so it\u2019s \"critical that vitamin A is not viewed as the primary course of treatment for all measles cases.\"",

      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "During an interview with Fox News Digital, Kuritzkes referenced research from the Harvard-Chan School of Public Health in 1993, which \"favored a benefit\" of vitamin A supplementation in the reduction of measles mortality for children in \"resource-limited settings\" or developing nations.",

      "\"Rather, children who have vitamin A deficiency, as occurs primarily in resource-limited settings like sub-Saharan Africa, have been shown to have more severe disease manifestations from measles and can benefit from vitamin A supplementation to correct their underlying deficiency,\" he echoed to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Vitamin A supplementation has not been shown to prevent measles infection and is in no way a substitute for vaccination, which has a proven benefit in preventing measles,\" one doctor noted. (iStock)",
      "\"Studies have not shown a clear, consistent benefit to vitamin A supplementation among patients in resource-rich settings like the United States who do not have underlying vitamin A deficiency.\"",
      "Although vitamin A is \"unlikely to harm the patient\" in appropriate doses, Khan shared that controlled studies \"do not support this practice.\"",

      "The CDC recommends vitamin A supplementation only under the guidance of a healthcare professional, which Kuritzkes said is \"critically important\" to ensure that the correct dose is administered.",

      "\"Thus, people should not be administering generic vitamin A supplements purchased at a pharmacy or health food store to their children.\"",

The defense team and the DOJ lobbed accusations back and forth over alleged withholding of evidence as they prepared for the Sept. 8, 2025, trial.",

However, the prosecution maintains that firearm testing is unusual, and it could destroy evidence.",

      "Here are 6 ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy:",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up-to-date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser \u2014 don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Additionally, your digital ID doesn't contain as much visible personal information as a physical ID card. Digital IDs stored in your Apple Wallet do not display personal information other than your full name.

They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",

However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs.

      "5. Enable two-factor authentication: This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts that will prevent a hacker from getting into your accounts.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: These services monitor your personal information and alert you to potential fraud. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources: Whatever you do, don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources whatsoever.",

I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems.

      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",

FrigidStealer spreads through compromised websites that display deceptive browser update prompts. When users click on these prompts, they unknowingly download a malicious DMG file. Once executed, the malware requests the user\u2019s system password to gain elevated privileges before stealing sensitive information, including browser cookies, password-related files, cryptocurrency data and Apple Notes.",
      "Proofpoint identified two new threat actors behind the operation: TA2726, which functions as a traffic distribution service provider, and TA2727, which delivers FrigidStealer to Mac users. The campaign also deploys malware on Windows and Android devices, signaling a multi-platform attack strategy. The cybersecurity firm assessed with high confidence that TA2726 distributes traffic for other malware campaigns as well. Some operations previously attributed to TA569 have now been reclassified under TA2726 and TA2727.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "As the digital landscape evolves, so do the nasty threats we face. FrigidStealer is just the latest reminder that no platform, not even macOS, is immune to the growing sophistication of cybercriminals. With infostealers like Lumma, StealC and Redline already compromising millions of devices and billions of credentials in 2024, the rise of AI-driven attacks and social engineering scams signals a challenging road ahead.",

Katrina Armstrong, issued a letter on Friday in response to the Trump administration cutting $400 million in federal grants to the school.

      "Bryan Kohberger's defense team is asking the judge overseeing his quadruple murder trial to block an eyewitness from testifying about the intruder she saw having \"bushy eyebrows\" on the night three of her housemates and another friend were killed in a 4 a.m. massacre.",
      "First, the defense argues that allowing the witness, identified in court filings as \"DM,\" would be unfair, too vague and unfairly prejudicial before the jury. Also in the motion, attorney Elisa Massoth denies that the defendant, Kohberger, has bushy eyebrows.",
      "She is also seeking an order barring any evidence related to \"bushy eyebrows\" in addition to keeping DM from using the phrase. In separate filings, the defense is also asking the court to limit the use of the words murder, psychopath and sociopath.",
      "The surviving housemate is the only known witness to have encountered the intruder and lived to tell her tale after she froze in shock, and he walked toward a back sliding door \u2013 and recently unsealed text messages so she tried in vain to reach her murdered friends minutes after the intruder left.",

      "Brian Kohberger pictured after his transfer to the Ada County jail in Boise, Idaho. (Ada County Sheriff\u2019s Office)",
      "The motion became public after Judge Steven Hippler told defense attorneys and prosecutors they were keeping too many court filings out of public view, filing them under seal without proper justification.",
      "Massoth wrote that DM was unable to describe the masked intruder to a sketch artist and did not know what color eyebrows the intruder had. The texts, at least the exceprts that have been made public, show she discussed the intruder's mask covering his mouth and forehead. They do not mention his eyebrows.",
      "\"Eyewitness identifications are inherently unreliable,\" said Edwina Elcox, a Boise-based defense attorney who formerly represented Lori Vallow. \"Especially this one \u2013 it's beyond vague.\"",

      "But what stands out to her in this case is the revelation in court filings that DM had a wall of photos and artwork, some of which she had drawn herself, depicting detailed faces and prominent eyebrows.",
      "Last month, defense attorneys tried to attack the housemate's credibility, arguing her story changed in the span of three interviews with investigators and that she admitted she had been drinking, felt tired and her memory was hazy.",
      "\"There is a beyond strong explanation, when somebody is so unsure about why they may have this distinctive impression of eyebrows \u2013 \u00a0because it's all over the room,\" Elcox told Fox News Digital. \"It's artwork that they're drawing.\"",
      "Read the motion",
      "The defense argued that this artwork could have influenced her memory.",
      "\"There is no reliability of the physical characteristics that D.M. has reported,\" Massoth wrote. \"Mr. Kohberger does not have bushy eyebrows, but the art work on D.M.\u2019s wall and that which she draws eyes with eyebrows could be described as bushy, full, or prominent.\"",

I can't imagine a more specific fact.\"",
      "The new filing also reveals DM had \"lucid dreams of being kidnapped or chased,\" she was a consumer of true-crime TV and podcasts.",

      "Brad Sigmon, 67, who admitted to the killings because his ex-girlfriend refused to get back to him, will be blindfolded and strapped to a chair at around 6 p.m. before three volunteers armed with rifles about 15 feet away will fire bullets into his heart.",
      "Each will be armed with .308-caliber, Winchester 110-grain TAP Urban ammunition often used by police marksmen. The bullet is designed to shatter on impact with something hard, like an inmate's chest bones, sending fragments meant to destroy the heart and cause death almost immediately.",

      "The execution will go ahead if South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson signed off on it. Sigmon\u2019s lawyers have asked McMaster to commute his death sentence to life in prison, arguing that he is a model prisoner and works every day to atone for the killings he committed after succumbing to severe mental illness. But no South Carolina governor has granted clemency in the 49 years since the death penalty resumed.",
      "Sigmon chose the firing squad method over the electric chair which would \"cook him alive,\" or a lethal injection, whose details are\u00a0kept secret\u00a0in South Carolina, his lawyers said.",
      "South Carolina keeping information secret about how it conducts lethal injections led him to decide on the firing squad, which he acknowledges will be a violent death, his lawyer said. On Thursday, Sigmon\u2019s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to delay his execution because the state doesn't release enough information about the lethal injection drug.",
      "Sigmon said he carried out the brutal slayings because he was angry that victims Gladys and David Larke had been evicted from a trailer they owned. They were in separate rooms of their Greenville County home and Sigmon went back and forth attacking them until they were dead, investigators said.",

If I couldn\u2019t have her, I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody else have her. And I knew it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t have her.\"",
      "He told jurors during his trial that he was obsessed with her. \"Did I love her? More than anything else in the world.\"",
      "Armstrong told USA Today this week that the killings ripped her family apart and that \"he should answer for what he's done.\"",
      "She said that her parents were simple country folk who had five children and were always looking out for everyone and that they've missed the births of some of their eight grandchildren and five great-grand children since they were murdered.",
      "\"They were the glue of the family,\" Armstrong said, adding, \"He took that away.\"",
      "Armstrong said she doesn't believe in the death penalty and won't attend the execution, although her son Ricky Sims will be there.",

      "The pause was caused in part by the state having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs after their supply expired because of pharmaceutical companies' concerns that they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to state officials. The state legislature then passed a shield law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers private.",

    "story": [
      "CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. \u2014\u00a0Sam Nordquist left home in Minnesota last fall and traveled 1,000 miles to be with a woman he\u2019d fallen in love with online.",
      "He ended up imprisoned in a cut-rate hotel in upstate New York, suffering unspeakable horrors before he was killed.",
      "A gang of seven people \u2014 including the woman for whom he\u2019d trekked across the country\u00a0\u2014 have been charged with murder, accused of torturing and humiliating the 24-year-old transgender Black man in the hotel room for weeks before eventually killing him. The only people who called police were Nordquist\u2019s mother and sister back home, who pleaded for authorities to check in on him when he stopped responding to their messages. But Nordquist\u2019s body had already been dumped, wrapped in plastic bags, in an empty field.",
      "Even though arrests have been made, first-degree murder charges have been filed and the victim laid to rest, this case remains an incomprehensible display of human malice. Online posts told a story of a happy couple, but Nordquist\u2019s friends and family were increasingly concerned when he didn\u2019t return their messages.",
      "His mother feared he was being controlled \u2014 and has accused authorities of ignoring warning signs and failing to protect her child. And LGBTQ activists have said the case is a dark reminder of the risks marginalized people face in America, particularly today.",
      "The seven suspects are all being held without bail. NBC News tried to reach their family and friends, but those who returned calls or answered doors declined to comment. The Ontario County Conflict Defender\u2019s Office, which is representing the defendants, declined to comment. None of the seven has yet entered a plea.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the answer why, because what human being could do what happened to Sam?\u201d Ontario County Assistant District Attorney Kelly Wolford said this week. \u201cWe\u2019ll never make sense of this case.\u201d",
      "\u2018She love-bombed him\u2019",
      "Sam Nordquist fell for a woman named Precious Arzuaga last August. They met online and ended up talking for hours on the phone, day and night, seven days a week, said his mother, Linda Nordquist. Sam seemed smitten, exhilarated for romance with a woman who flooded him with affection.",
      "\u201cSam was vulnerable. He looked like he was 15, young,\u201d Linda Nordquist told NBC News. \u201cShe love-bombed him.\u201d",
      "Arzuaga lived outside Canandaigua, in New York\u2019s Finger Lakes region. She was 38, with several children, some young, others adults \u2014 it\u2019s not clear how many she had. If Sam knew that, he didn\u2019t seem to mind. He began planning a trip to see her in mid-September and expected to stay a week.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to find love and he wanted to be loved. No one can blame him for that. Anyone would want that,\u201d a friend, Jaxon Seeger, recalled. \u201cHe was excited for the trip and the adventure.\u201d",
      "Seeger, who lives in Madison, Wisconsin, had befriended Sam after meeting him in an internet support group for transgender people years earlier. Seeger watched videos Sam posted on TikTok with Arzuaga and thought it all looked normal. Still, Seeger knew it was risky for a transgender man in a new place among unfamiliar people.",
      "At first, things appeared to be going well. Sam sent his mom photographs of the couple together, both smiling, she said. But on Oct. 12, the day he was expected to return home, he\u00a0did not show up. Linda said he did not answer texts and phone calls from the family.",
      "Sam had told Linda that he was staying in Room 22 at Patty\u2019s Lodge, a roadside hotel on the outskirts of Canandaigua, surrounded by farmland. The collection of single-story pale, brown buildings with mismatched curtains stands in contrast to the vibrantly colored Victorian homes that line the city\u2019s Main Street and the mansions, yacht clubs and lavish hotels that border nearby Canandaigua Lake, the city\u2019s glistening namesake.",
      "Patty\u2019s Lodge is not a tourist haunt. It is a destination of last resort. Some rooms are rented for weeks at a time by people on the verge of homelessness or facing other emergencies; in some instances their stays are paid for using vouchers provided by the Ontario County Department of Social Services. Others are registered sex offenders, according to records published by the Ontario County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "It is unclear how Sam and Arzuaga ended up at Patty\u2019s Lodge and if anyone else was staying with them.",
      "On Oct. 13, Linda said she contacted the New York State Police and requested a wellness check at Room 22. Not long after, she said, Sam and Arzuaga called and assured her that everything was fine. Sam told Linda that he wanted to stay indefinitely to pursue his new relationship and to help Arzuaga support her kids, she said.",
      "The state police reached Sam at Patty\u2019s Lodge that same day.",
      "\u201cAt that time, Sam told the trooper he was fine and did not need any medical or law enforcement help,\u201d State Police spokesperson Trooper Lynnea Crane said in an email.",
      "But based on the conversations Linda had with police after the wellness check, she believes law enforcement was misled and didn\u2019t do a thorough enough job looking for signs of distress. She says law enforcement downplayed their ongoing concerns.",
      "\u201cThey said that they talked to Sam and everything appeared to be fine, that everything was good. Well, that\u2019s because that Precious was right there,\u201d Linda said. \u201cI think Sam was scared and intimidated, and that they should have separated them and they didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Although the family was suspicious of their relationship, Sam and Arzuaga appeared online like a happy couple. Of the more than two dozen videos Sam posted on TikTok between September and November, most of the clips show the pair dancing together and embracing each other affectionately. Sam described Arzuaga as his \u201cride or die,\u201d \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d throughout several of the posts.",
      "Desiree Tucker, 32, used to make TikToks with Arzuaga, too, when the two dated on and off from 2022 to 2024, she said. But when the cameras were off, things weren\u2019t so great between them. If she declined to do the videos, she risked a beating from Arzuaga, Tucker said in an interview.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s like: \u2018Oh, you look so happy in your TikToks,\u2019\u201d Tucker said. \u201cYeah, I know I did. And I did exactly what she wanted me to do. Because I knew if I didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be good for me.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 18, Tucker\u2019s local police department in Toronto, Ohio, showed up at her house asking about Arzuaga on behalf of New York State Police, she said. She said she told them Arzuaga physically abused her throughout their relationship. She also said Arzuaga refused her access to her phone and social media, and wouldn\u2019t allow her to contact her family at times. Arzuaga is in jail and could not be reached for comment; Toronto police didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Sam\u2019s family had tried to stay in touch with him, but his responses to their calls and texts grew infrequent. When he did answer, they said, it was usually because they threatened to request more welfare checks to Room 22. He downplayed their concerns, which made Linda worry more.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t sound like himself. It\u2019s like he was being coached on what to say,\u201d she said. \u201cSam lived with me his whole, entire life. We were always together. So I know how Sam talks \u2014\u00a0and this was not Sam.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 4, she said, she got an email from the Ontario County Department of Social Services, which includes the town where Sam was living.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m working with your son Sam. He wanted me to reach you,\u201d the worker wrote, according to a screenshot of the exchange shared by Linda. \u201cIf you can please contact me as soon as you get this email.\u201d",
      "The social services agent later told her in a phone call that Arzuaga was controlling Sam\u2019s cellphone use, that he wanted to come home to Minnesota and that he was concocting an \u201cescape plan,\u201d Linda said. The agent added that Sam was supposed to return to the social services office on Dec. 19, but he never showed up, Linda said. The county social services department didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Sam\u2019s friend Seeger was also sending messages every few days and receiving sporadic responses.",
      "A day or two before New Year\u2019s, Seeger said, Sam texted. He said everything was going well, that he was staying at Patty\u2019s Lodge and that he planned to celebrate the holiday in New York.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Day, Linda spoke with Sam, wishing him a fresh start to 2025.",
      "\u201cHe kept the conversation short and said, \u2018I love you and I\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It was the last time she ever spoke to him."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Saturday unveiled a short-term funding bill that would avert a shutdown at the end of next week and keep the government running through the end of September.",
      "Johnson has said he will bring the funding bill to the floor for a vote early next week, likely Tuesday, before money runs out late Friday night. It's unclear it has the votes to pass either chamber, as it was not negotiated with Democrats, making it an important test for the new Republican trifecta on a must-pass bill that requires bipartisan backing to become law.",
      "President Donald Trump has backed Johnson's approach and said he'll sign the bill if it reaches his desk, which would avoid a shutdown less than two months into his term.",
      "\"All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly after the bill was released. \"I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country\u2019s \u201cfinancial house\u201d in order. Democrats will do anything they can to shut down our Government, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\"",
      "The continuing resolution, or CR, includes an increase in defense spending while reducing non-defense discretionary spending. It does not expand the budget for additional emergency funding, disaster designations or community project funding, also known as earmarks.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no Christmas tree effect here,\u201d a House Republican leadership staffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we need to fund the government and to allow that to happen.\u201d",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, slammed the legislation within moments of its release Saturday.",
      "\u201cI strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution, which is a power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cBy essentially closing the book on negotiations for full-year funding bills that help the middle class and protect our national security, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have handed their power to an unelected billionaire.\u201d",
      "Even prior to the bill's release, House Democratic leaders came out in opposition to Johnson's plan, warning that the emerging legislation could result in spending cuts to areas like health care, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits.",
      "The gulf between the two parties on the continuing resolution raises the chances of a shutdown. If House Democrats unify against the bill, it's unclear if Johnson and the Republicans would be able to muscle it through the chamber on a party-line vote, like they did with the budget resolution last month.",
      "With a wafer-thin 218-214 majority, just two Republican defections could derail the measure. And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a vocal Johnson critic, has already vowed to vote no.",
      "\"It's obviously a challenge for us,\" Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, told reporters this week after he hosted a meeting on funding with key House and Senate Republicans.",
      "If Johnson can push the stopgap bill through his chamber next week, all eyes would be on Senate Democrats. Republicans have a 53-47 advantage there, so Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., would need to secure seven Democratic votes to reach the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, torched the bill, calling it a \u201cslush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending\u2014and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike.\u201d",
      "Neither party is pushing for a shutdown, but they continue to differ on how to avoid one. For Republicans, it could distract and delay them from passing a reconciliation package needed to tackle Trump's agenda on border security, energy and tax cuts. And Democrats have demanded guardrails on the president's power over spending directed by Congress, which the GOP opposes.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have been blasting Trump, his billionaire adviser Musk and congressional Republicans for slashing federal spending and firing thousands of federal workers. And in a letter to colleagues Friday, Democratic leaders warned that a CR could impose more cuts that they called \"not acceptable.\"",
      "But a shutdown would furlough millions of remaining federal workers in every part of the country."

      "The woman, Lucy Grace Nelson, allegedly\u00a0returned to the dealership four more times in recent weeks to cause further damage. She hurled more molotov cocktails, attempted to set the dealership ablaze and spray painted the word \"nazi cars\" on the building, before ultimately being arrested last week, Loveland police said. Musk has been accused of supporting antisemitic claims and insulting victims of Nazism.",
      "About 2,000 miles east, more than a half-dozen Tesla charging stations were intentionally set on fire near Boston, police said Monday.",
      "And on the West Coast, in Tigard, Oregon, police said Thursday that at least seven shots were fired at a Tesla dealership there that morning, damaging three cars and shattering windows.",

      "He said his department has no indication that the vandalism at the Colorado dealership is connected to the acts of vandalism elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is absolutely not the way to make a statement,\u201d Doran said in an interview. \u201cPutting people\u2019s lives at risk is never the way to do this.\u201d",
      "In January, President Donald Trump tapped Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "DOGE \u2014 previously known as the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 has been slashing the federal workforce and government programs at an unprecedented pace in recent weeks. As civil servants have been abruptly laid off in masses, in-person GOP town halls have turned heated, with many constituents lashing out at lawmakers over the cuts.",
      "Musk\u2019s appointment to the agency and his designation as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201c \u2014 which circumvents him from undergoing more onerous vetting requirements typical of full-time government employees \u2014 has raised concerns over\u00a0potential conflicts of interest. Musk, the world's richest man, helms X, SpaceX, brain computer implant company Neuralink and AI company xAI, in addition to Tesla.",
      "The attacks at Tesla dealerships also coincide with a decline in sales for the electric carmaker. Recent data show increasing sales growth of electric-battery vehicles in Europe, but new Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe are down 45% year-on-year for January and down in China.",
      "Musk's foray into politics appears to have hit his personal fortune as well. From mid-December, the tech titan\u2019s net worth dropped more than $100 billion, or approximately 25%, fueled by a sell-off of Tesla shares. As of Saturday, Tesla shares are down more than 30% since the start of the year.",
      "Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia Business School who authored \"Tribal,\" book about cultural divides, said he predicts the cultural blowback will eventually force Musk to resign from DOGE if his businesses continue to suffer.",
      "\"It would be a tragedy for the world if Elon Musk\u2019s good work at Tesla and his good work at SpaceX, and his good work at his solar company got derailed by cultural blowback against his somewhat amateurish attempts to reform government,\" Morris said.",
      "The disruptions at Tesla facilities don't appear to be slowing down.",
      "On Friday, the same Colorado Tesla dealership was again set on fire, according to police. Police said in a statement that the new case does not appear to be related to Nelson, but suggested that she inspired a copycat bad actor. Nelson was charged with use of explosives or incendiary devices during a felony, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit a Class 3 felony, and is out of jail on a personal recognizance bond.",
      "And on Saturday in New York City, police arrested nine protesters who demonstrated inside a Tesla showroom, according to a spokesperson for the New York City Police Department."

    "story": [
      "After a long winter of short days, it\u2019s finally time to spring forward.",
      "Clocks across the U.S. will jump from 1:59 a.m. to 3 a.m. Sunday.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about daylight saving time and why we change the clocks twice a year in the U.S.",
      "How long will daylight saving time last?",
      "Daylight saving time will start Sunday and last until Nov. 2. Standard time will have been in effect from Nov. 3, 2024, until Sunday.",
      "The springtime clock change differs from the fall. Unlike the fall, when we gain an extra hour and the clocks fall back, we lose an hour in the spring.",
      "But that turns into longer days and brighter evenings as the spring and summer months begin. It will remain in effect until we turn the clocks back to standard time, which comes back into effect on Nov. 2 as we ready for winter and usher in an era of shorter days.",
      "Why do we change the clocks?",
      "The U.S. has been observing daylight saving time since 1918, with the passage of the Standard Time Act, according to the\u00a0U.S. Astronomical Applications Department. It was an effort to extend summertime daylight hours by pushing off sunset an hour.",
      "Daylight saving time wasn\u2019t totally accepted at first \u2014\u00a0it was quickly repealed in 1919, making the changing of clocks a local matter. The practice was officially reinstated during the early days of World War II and was observed from 1942-45, according to the department.",
      "Daylight saving time varied by state until 1966 with the passage of the Uniform Time Act, which standardized dates of daylight saving time, but allowed for states and localities to opt out of the practice if they did not want to participate.",
      "Since that act passed, the standardized dates have been changed throughout the years, according to the department.",
      "But the dates have remained the same since 2007. Since then, daylight saving time has started on the second Sunday in March and ended on the first Sunday in November.",
      "Are there any states that don\u2019t observe the time change?",
      "Yes. Residents in Hawaii and most of Arizona won\u2019t lose an hour of sleep Sunday night. The two states do not observe daylight saving time and do not change the clocks twice a year, according to the Astronomical Applications Department.",
      "Is anyone trying to change the practice?",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, which would make daylight saving time permanent year-round and usher out the era of changing clocks, in March 2022. Under the bill, Hawaii and most of Arizona would continue to observe year-round standard time.",
      "But the bill stalled in the House of Representatives, so the U.S. will continue to flip the clocks twice a year until new legislation is passed in the House and Senate and then signed by the sitting president.",
      "President Donald Trump addressed the practice this week when asked by a reporter when he is going to \u201cget rid of\u201d daylight saving time.",
      "\u201cI assume people would like to have more light late, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don\u2019t want to take their kids to school in the dark,\u201d he said, calling the issue \u201c50-50.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut a lot of people like it one way, a lot of people like it the other way. It\u2019s very even,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd usually, I find when that\u2019s the case, what else do we have to do?\u201d",
      "Shortly after winning the election last year, Trump said he and Republicans would try to \u201celiminate\u201d daylight saving time, calling it inconvenient and costly. It was unclear at the time whether he was referring to eliminating daylight saving time or making it permanent.",
      "Almost all U.S. states have considered legislation to avoid changing the clocks, staying on either standard or daylight saving time year-round.",
      "In the last six years, 20 states have passed bills or resolutions to codify year-round daylight saving time, according to the\u00a0National Conference of State Legislatures. But since federal law does not currently allow year-round daylight saving time, those states are in a holding pattern until Congress passes the bill to make the change.",
      "Is the U.S. the only country that changes the clocks?",
      "No, many other countries observe some version of \u201csummer time,\u201d whether that\u2019s daylight saving time or their own version. Not all do so on the same schedule as the U.S., though.",
      "In the Southern Hemisphere, for example, the seasons are swapped, so the start and end date of \u201csummer time\u201d are reversed from ours, according to the Astronomical Applications Department.",
      "What do health experts say?",
      "Some studies suggest that using daylight saving time year-round could reduce the\u00a0number of traffic accidents\u00a0and the\u00a0amount of crime, but a number of experts are against longer days year-round.",
      "According to some sleep experts, the sun should reach the highest point in the sky at noon, or solar time, which occurs during standard time.",
      "A study from\u00a0June 2022\u00a0found that people whose clock times weren\u2019t closely aligned with the sun had 22% higher road fatality rates than those living within 30 minutes of solar time.",
      "CORRECTION (March 8, 2025, 3:26 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how often the clocks change. It is twice a year, not every six months."

      "Questions about tech investor Elon Musk's extraordinary influence in President Donald Trump's White House found answers that doubled as punchlines on \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "The show, headed for the season's finish line after celebrations and wall-to-wall performances over a weekend of 50th anniversary programming last month, tapped into the cynical mojo that helped it launch three generations ago by reflecting a sense of chaos in Trump's second-term administration.",
      "With James Austin Johnson returning as a free-range Trump and Mike Myers reprising his role as Musk hovering near the president like a wisecracking helicopter parent, the show followed the money.",
      "The cold open found the two in the Oval Office with Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez's Secretary of State Marco Rubio as Trump attempted to fix Rubio's relationship with Musk as the two have reportedly clashed over Musk's firing employees without giving consideration to whether letting them go would improve or harm his agency.",
      "Johnson's Trump said he couldn't tolerate the infighting, especially as he returned to the White House for what \"otherwise has been a smooth\" start to his term.",
      "\"I need you to be my good 'Little Marco,'\" Trump said, employing a nickname the president used for Rubio when the two battled for the Republican nomination for president in 2016.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez's Rubio seemed insulted, saying that if Trump thinks he's just going to stand there and let the president call him that, \"You're right.\"",
      "Following a collision between a passenger jet and military helicopter that killed 67 on Jan. 30 and the crash the next day of an air ambulance jet that killed six, Trump suggested Myers' Musk is the aviation expert the country needs.",
      "\"He runs SpaceX, which is doing incredible things in terms of explosions,\" Trump said in an apparent reference to the recent explosion of a SpaceX rocket.",
      "And, speaking of Rubio's leadership, Trump said, \"He's the GOAT. He's the scapegoat, but it's still a type of goat.\"",
      "But when Rubio told Trump he was close to concluding an agreement that would include U.S. control of the Panama Canal, a move the president desired in real life, SNL's Trump said, \"I don't want it anymore,\" instead coveting Thailand because of its appearance on \"White Lotus.\"",
      "The president was focused on getting Musk and Rubio to \"work things out,\" noting, \"Everyone that has ever worked for me has left on good terms.\"",
      "As Trump hosted the domestic peace summit, Musk began a dialogue in his mind, saying, \"People really hate me\" before placing a pinky finger to a corner of his mouth in the style of the villain in Myers' \"Austin Powers\" movie franchise, Dr. Evil.",
      "\"My personal net worth has dropped by $100 billion dollars,\" he said of Musk's sacrifice to be at Trump's side.",

      "The possibility of a link between vaccines and autism has been repeatedly debunked by hundreds of scientific studies. But Kennedy made a profile for himself as an anti-vaccine crusader, criticizing the Covid-19 vaccine and claiming childhood immunizations are linked to autism. He also founded Children\u2019s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group.",

      "Speaking to Congress Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cAs an example, not long ago, and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers, 1 in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it\u2019s 1 in 36. There\u2019s something wrong.

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 The search for President Donald Trump\u2019s post-administration presidential library site is intensifying in South Florida, with Trump\u2019s son Eric and a top Trump administration adviser, Steve Witkoff, getting involved in recent weeks.",
      "Trump\u2019s team has had site selectors scoping out potential South Florida locations for months, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is meeting with Trump in Palm Beach County this weekend to discuss places to build a potential Trump library, five sources tell NBC News.",
      "Though no final decision has been made, the current top targets are Florida Atlantic University, located in Palm Beach County, and Florida International University, located in Miami-Dade County. Palm Beach County is Trump\u2019s official residence, and the location there is in close proximity to Mar-a-Lago. Miami-Dade County is home to Trump\u2019s Doral golf resort, another one of his major properties.",
      "There are also sites not connected to a university under consideration, sources tell NBC News. But FAU and FIU are lobbying heavily to win the site, and they have started to offer enticements, including potentially donating land to build the presidential library.",
      "Trump\u2019s team has said it would like a new hotel associated with the presidential library, two sources tell NBC News, which is a part of the active negotiations.",
      "The presidents of Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University are both well-connected former Republican elected officials, and both have been heavily engaged in the process. Florida Atlantic University is led by Adam Hasner, a former high-ranking member of the state House, and Florida International University\u2019s president is Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, who was DeSantis\u2019 lieutenant governor until he appointed her to the FIU post last month.",
      "Neither Hasner or Nu\u00f1ez returned requests seeking comment. A DeSantis spokesperson also did not return a request seeking comment.",
      "The White House did not return a request seeking comment, but a Trump administration official confirmed that South Florida has become the focus of the presidential search.",
      "Eric Trump joined Witkoff and Nu\u00f1ez on a tour of FIU\u2019s potential sites over the past few weeks, a process that included Florida House Speaker Danny Perez, a Miami-Dade County Republican who has spoken directly to Witkoff and is among the leaders trying to get the library in Miami.",
      "\u201cEric Trump was here. He took a tour of FIU, so they have been at least looking,\u201d said one person familiar with the tour.",
      "Eric Trump has also toured FAU-aligned sites.",
      "\u201cThere has been a strong push to put the library at FAU, even offering land for construction of the library,\u201d said a person familiar with those negotiations. \u201cThere seems to be a lot of interest in doing that because it\u2019s in the president\u2019s home county.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are evaluating all options right now, but it appears the governor and the state university system are clamoring for the chance to get the president\u2019s library,\u201d that person added.",
      "Republicans in the state have been making efforts to ensure that Florida becomes the home of the presidential library. Trump was a New York resident until 2019, when he officially made Florida his primary residence.",
      "Beyond direct talks with DeSantis, the GOP-dominated Florida Legislature is moving quickly to pass a bill that would allow Republicans in Tallahassee to be in charge of decisions about presidential libraries, removing the ability of local authorities to oversee the construction of any presidential library.",
      "The change would box out Democratic-leaning local officials in South Florida from the decision-making and approval processes around a proposed Trump presidential library. Trump carried Miami-Dade County in 2024, but Palm Beach County was one of just six Florida counties won by former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential contest.",
      "\u201cAfter the flap over the size of Trump\u2019s flag, I don\u2019t want my president getting in trouble for being too patriotic ever again,\u201d said Orlando-area Republican state Sen. Jason Brodeur, who is sponsoring the legislation in his chamber.",
      "It\u2019s a reference to a 2006 legal fight between Trump and town of Palm Beach officials over an 80-foot flagpole flying an American flag over a Trump golf course, which local officials said exceeded the maximum size allowed by town ordinances. Trump and the town later settled, allowing a 70-foot flagpole in a different location.",
      "Republican state Rep. Alex Andrade, another sponsor of the bill, said he would be in favor of a nonuniversity site for Trump\u2019s library to avoid a turf war between FAU and FIU.",
      "\u201cPutting it at either university is going to result in whining and protesting,\u201d he said. \u201cWith such an important proposition that will inevitably benefit the immediate surrounding area, it\u2019s embarrassing that it will be met with whining and protesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither institution would be lucky to have it,\u201d he added.",
      "Another person familiar with the negotiations confirmed FAU and FIU are top targets, but the subject of talks this weekend between Trump and DeSantis do include other sites.",
      "\u201cThey are currently looking at sites in South Florida,\u201d the person said. \u201cBoth FAU and FIU want it, but my understanding is they are looking at nonuniversity sites.\u201d"

      "The Health and Human Services separation offer comes as Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency work to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce through widespread layoffs, the dismantling of entire agencies and substantial cuts to federal programs and grants.",
      "The move comes after President Donald Trump clarified in a Cabinet meeting this week that agency heads \u2014 not Musk \u2014 are in charge of staffing decisions.",
      "Trump, however, warned his Cabinet secretaries that if they don\u2019t sufficiently cut staffing in their departments, Musk would intervene.",
      "\u201cIf they can cut, it\u2019s better. If they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting,\u201d Trump said Thursday.",
      "The Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment Authority, also known as the buyout authority, allows agencies that are downsizing or restructuring to offer employees lump-sum payments of up to $25,000 as an incentive to voluntarily separate.",
      "The Trump administration in January similarly offered roughly 2 million federal workers voluntary buyouts, an offer the White House later said roughly 75,000 people accepted."

    "story": [
      "An unusually high number of disoriented marine mammals, sickened by a toxic algae bloom, is being found along Southern California\u2019s coast, prompting concerns 2025 could be the deadliest year yet.",
      "As an algae bloom, formed off the shores of California, including Malibu and Dockweiler Beach, is occurring for the fourth year in a row, a neurological toxin called domoic acid from the algae has already sickened dozens of sea lions and elephant seals this year alone, causing them to strand with seizures or lethargy, according to the Marine Mammal Care Center, a nonprofit rescue organization.",
      "While algae blooms are natural phenomena, the last four years have been more intense and widespread due to warmer water temperature, the rescue group said.",
      "What\u2019s more concerning this year compared to 2023 is the algae bloom is starting early in February.",
      "In 2023, the Marine Mammal Care Center had 70 sea lions in its care by July. In early March of 2025, the center is already nearly half full.",
      "\u201cWe have room for about 120 animals, and we\u2019re already at 50 plus,\u201d said John Warner, CEO of the Marine Mammal Care Center. \u201cThis can add up to a real capacity issue quickly, where we run out of space, and that\u2019s what happened in 2023.\u201d",
      "The animal rescue organization has been taking in up to eight sea lions or marine mammals a day in recent weeks, Warner said.",
      "Marine biology experts also fear the algae blooms will impact seal mammal conservation. As the Channel Islands are the breeding ground for nearly 85% of all California sea lions, many females won\u2019t be able to carry the full term of their pregnancy.",
      "\u201cTheir bodies are just so wrecked that they will have miscarriages or aborted fetuses,\u201d Warner explains, saying most of the female sea lions rescued this year were pregnant. \u201c We\u2019re not sure what the long-term effects of this seizure activity and neurological toxin is, but we\u2019re seeing fewer births this year on the Channel Islands.\u201d",
      "There is a lack of scientific data that explains what may be intensifying algae blooms, but experts fear ash from the Los Angeles wildfires, or even fire retardant used to put out the fires, may have something to do with it.",
      "\u201cThe fire, both the brush and organic material will definitely also contribute to that,\u201d Warner explained. \u201cThe fire retardant is a thing that we really need to understand more about in terms of what it may or may not be doing in this particular damage.\u201d",
      "As more people will head to the beach in the coming spring and summer, the mammal center is renewing a warning against interacting with stranded animals on the beach.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an animal that has a neurological toxin and having a seizure, you\u2019re dooming the animal by going up to it, taking a selfie, petting it or putting your child on it,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThe springtime especially is when these animals are breeding. Literally, it\u2019s life and death when you interfere and stress them out.\u201d",
      "When spotting a stranded animal, people are encouraged to report it to the Marine Mammal Care center at 1-800-39-WHALE."

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 18:42:58 GMT",
    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Saturday unveiled a stopgap funding bill that would avert a shutdown at the end of next week and keep the government running through the end of September.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Saturday unveiled a short-term funding bill that would avert a shutdown at the end of next week and keep the government running through the end of September.",
      "Johnson has said he will bring the funding bill to the floor for a vote early next week, likely Tuesday, before money runs out late Friday night. It's unclear it has the votes to pass either chamber, as it was not negotiated with Democrats, making it an important test for the new Republican trifecta on a must-pass bill that requires bipartisan backing to become law.",
      "President Donald Trump has backed Johnson's approach and said he'll sign the bill if it reaches his desk, which would avoid a shutdown less than two months into his term.",
      "\"All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly after the bill was released. \"I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country\u2019s \u201cfinancial house\u201d in order. Democrats will do anything they can to shut down our Government, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\"",
      "The continuing resolution, or CR, includes an increase in defense spending while reducing non-defense discretionary spending. It does not expand the budget for additional emergency funding, disaster designations or community project funding, also known as earmarks.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no Christmas tree effect here,\u201d a House Republican leadership staffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we need to fund the government and to allow that to happen.\u201d",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, slammed the legislation within moments of its release Saturday.",
      "\u201cI strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution, which is a power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cBy essentially closing the book on negotiations for full-year funding bills that help the middle class and protect our national security, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have handed their power to an unelected billionaire.\u201d",
      "Even prior to the bill's release, House Democratic leaders came out in opposition to Johnson's plan, warning that the emerging legislation could result in spending cuts to areas like health care, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits.",
      "The gulf between the two parties on the continuing resolution raises the chances of a shutdown. If House Democrats unify against the bill, it's unclear if Johnson and the Republicans would be able to muscle it through the chamber on a party-line vote, like they did with the budget resolution last month.",
      "With a wafer-thin 218-214 majority, just two Republican defections could derail the measure. And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a vocal Johnson critic, has already vowed to vote no.",
      "\"It's obviously a challenge for us,\" Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, told reporters this week after he hosted a meeting on funding with key House and Senate Republicans.",
      "If Johnson can push the stopgap bill through his chamber next week, all eyes would be on Senate Democrats. Republicans have a 53-47 advantage there, so Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., would need to secure seven Democratic votes to reach the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, torched the bill, calling it a \u201cslush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending\u2014and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike.\u201d",
      "Neither party is pushing for a shutdown, but they continue to differ on how to avoid one. For Republicans, it could distract and delay them from passing a reconciliation package needed to tackle Trump's agenda on border security, energy and tax cuts. And Democrats have demanded guardrails on the president's power over spending directed by Congress, which the GOP opposes.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have been blasting Trump, his billionaire adviser Musk and congressional Republicans for slashing federal spending and firing thousands of federal workers. And in a letter to colleagues Friday, Democratic leaders warned that a CR could impose more cuts that they called \"not acceptable.\"",
      "But a shutdown would furlough millions of remaining federal workers in every part of the country."

    "story": [
      "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Xavier Worthy was released Saturday after a district attorney in Texas declined to pursue charges against the Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver following an arrest in which he had been accused of felony domestic violence.",
      "Williamson County District Attorney Shawn Dick told the Austin American-Statesman his office had spoken with witnesses and was not accepting the case at this time. He also said Worthy and his lawyers were fully cooperating with the investigation.",
      "Records showed that Worthy had been arrested Friday by deputies and held in the county jail on a charge of assault on a family or household member in which their breath was impeded, or choking in common terms. The online court listing for the case was updated to \u201cdismissed/declined\u201d later Saturday.",
      "Williamson County includes parts of Austin, where Worthy played college football at the University of Texas.",
      "In a statement, Worthy\u2019s attorneys, Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett, said their client was innocent of the charge against him. They said the allegation was made by a female who had been living in Worthy\u2019s home, and that she had been asked to leave the home multiple times over the last two weeks \u201cupon discovery of her infidelity.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe has refused to vacate the residence and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against Mr. Worthy,\u201d the lawyers\u2019 statement said. \u201cThe complainant further destroyed a room in the residence, scratched Mr. Worthy\u2019s face and ripped out parts of his hair, which there is photographic evidence of. Worthy told law enforcement at the time of the incident he did not want to press charges against the complainant.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs told The Associated Press on Saturday that they were aware of the situation and still gathering information.",
      "Under Texas law, impeding breathing means \u201cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the person\u2019s throat or neck or by blocking the person\u2019s nose or mouth.\u201d",
      "Worthy was chosen by the Chiefs with the 28th overall pick in last year\u2019s draft after setting the record for the fastest 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He got off to a quick start by scoring a pair of touchdowns in his NFL debut, and after a midseason lull, he became the Chiefs\u2019 go-to wide receiver as they chased an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title.",
      "Worthy finished with 59 catches for 638 yards and six TDs while running 20 times for 104 yards and three more scores.",
      "He was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in a 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl, too. Worthy caught all eight of his targets for 157 yards and a pair of touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans.",
      "The Chiefs came to rely on Worthy in part because of a season-ending injury to wide receiver Rashee Rice, who was coming off a brilliant rookie season of his own. Rice caught 24 passes for 288 yards and two TDs in four games before getting hurt.",
      "Rice and another driver, Theodore Knox, were involved in a high-speed car crash in March 2024 that triggered a chain reaction on a highway in Dallas, close to where he had played college football at SMU. Rice is currently facing at least two civil lawsuits along with numerous criminal charges for his role in the wreck.",
      "Rice\u00a0turned himself in following the crash, and his attorney, Texas Sen. Royce West, said that the wide receiver admitted that he was driving the Lamborghini involved. Rice also posted on social media that he took responsibility for his role in the crash."

      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 8 stars Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton have had an unusual journey during their time on the Netflix dating show.",
      "Back in the pods, the couple bonded before realizing a glaring difference between them. Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, explained to Ben that she grew up in a conservative household but was no longer religious and she shared that her sister, Lisa, was gay. Sara also expressed her opinions on the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, noting that she felt more engaged in social issues during that time given that George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Ben, a 28-year-old developer, said that he went to church often and that faith played a big role in his life. But he said he had \u201cno discomfort around that community at all,\u201d when referring to the LGBTQ+ community and that he was \u201cignorant\u201d toward politics and the BLM movement.",
      "Despite not being on the same page, both thought that their values aligned and they decided to get engaged. When they left the pods, they continued to have lengthy conversations where they discussed conflicting views about religion. In Episode 10, Sara also learned that Ben\u2019s ex released a TikTok video in which she labeled some of the Season 8 cast as \u201cs----- men,\u201d appearing to refer to him.",
      "Again, they moved past their problems and proceeded with the experiment, seemingly developing stronger feelings along the way. Episode 12 ended on a cliffhanger as fans waited to see if the couple would say \u201cI do.\u201d",

      "Did Sara and Ben get married?",
      "Episode 13, the season finale, began with the conclusion of Sara and Ben\u2019s wedding. Although both gushed about their connection in the scenes leading up to their decision at the altar, Sara announced she did not want to get married.",
      "\u201cBen, I love you so much,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always wanted a partner to be on the same wavelength. So today, I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want that to be misunderstood. I still love you and everything about you is amazing. I care about you so much.\u201d",
      "Ben tried to remain optimistic. He told Sara he still loved her and would like to date \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d",
      "She politely shut him down. \u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that.\u201d",
      "Sara then walked out of the ceremony and sat in a car to process the situation with her mom, Kathy, and sister, Lisa.",
      "She assured her family she was fine and mentioned her pod conversation with Ben about BLM as one of the reasons she couldn\u2019t marry him. She said she often wondered if their relationship was just \u201csurface, fun, carefree love\u201d and worried that there was \u201cno curiosity coming from his side.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Ben remained at the ceremony with his friends. Together, they prayed for him and Sara. Ben said he wanted to unpack everything with Sara, but the couple did not communicate the rest of the episode.",
      "Instead, Sara further explained her decision to the cameras. She said the two were \u201cnot a good fit\u201d and that she could not continue the \u201ccycle\u201d of them trying to sort through their different values.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ben said that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Sara\u2019s choice while she offered more insight into their relationship",
      "She said that she had to \u201cconstantly give him the benefit of the doubt\u201d when they disagreed.",
      "Sara added, \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential.\u201d Even though they didn\u2019t get married, she said she still believed love is blind and that she was proud of herself.",

      "Fans will find out if Sara and Ben reconciled after their abrupt breakup at the reunion, which arrives March 9 at 9 p.m. ET/ 6 p.m. PT on Netflix."

She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",

      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appeared to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "But by the finale, her tune had changed. Sara decided not to marry Ben \u2014 who seemed shocked and, in his words, \"devastated\" by her decision. Sara cited their differing values and political beliefs as one of her reasons.",
      "Ben wanted to continue dating but Sara seemed to balk. \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential,\" she said.",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",
      "Read the rest of our interview with Alex here.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye.",

      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller's relationship appeared to be smooth sailing from the moment they connected in the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating pods.",
      "The connection was instantaneous once the duo met and soon realized they attended the same high school. Despite finding themselves in a bit of a love triangle with fellow show contestant Brittany Dodson, Buckley and Miller got engaged sight unseen in the pods.",
      "The newly engaged couple quickly put their relationship to the test in the real world and sought to answer the question: Is love really blind?",
      "As the couple heads to the altar during the final installment of shows from this season, let's take a look back at their \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d journey.",
      "What happened between Virginia and Devin in the pods?",
      "Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had chemistry with Virginia, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, early on in the dating experiment. The pair quickly discovered that they\u2019d attended the same high school, albeit a few years apart. Luckily, the age difference didn't seem to phase the pair.",
      "Simultaneously, Devin was talking with Brittany Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, and they started to form a connection. Soon enough, Devin and Brittany realized they weren't the best fit for each other and went their separate ways on amicable terms. This left Devin free to pursue his connection with Virginia.",
      "At the same time, Devin was a bit worried that Virginia was too \u201cclosed off\u201d and slow to open up. She began to express herself more freely and noted that she's at first very \u201cshy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to keep choosing the wrong guy,\u201d she said, adding that she hasn't had many good examples of healthy relationships in her life.",
      "Virginia called Devin \u201cquite refreshing\u201d and said she'd never dated a \u201cnice guy\u201d before. In a confessional interview, Devin called Virginia a \u201ckind, loving, genuine person.\u201d",

      "The couple got to know each other more once they returned home from the group vacation and soon moved into an apartment together.",
      "While talking about financial assets, Virginia said she'd like to get a prenuptial agreement and Devin said he'd \u201cnever really thought about that.\u201d",
      "The topic of a prenup came up yet again when Virginia met Devin\u2019s family. They seemed taken aback by the idea and worried that Virginia might already have one foot out the door. Still, Virginia politely stuck to her belief that a prenup is simply \u201cthe modern way of doing things.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Devin agreed to sign the prenup, noting that it was pretty straightforward.",
      "The couple differed on their political views",
      "Politics were somewhat of a point of contention for Devin and Virginia. In Episode 10, they had a serious conversation about their political views after Virginia encouraged Devin to open up about serious topics that could impact their marriage.",

      "Virginia was open to differing political opinions, but noted that it would be \u201ckind of alarming\u201d if Devin was \u201cway on the other side of the spectrum\u201d on political issues that matter to her.",

      "\u201cI love you so much, but I'm just not ready,\u201d she declared, much to the surprise of her father, who expressed shock at his daughter's revelation.",

She explained that she felt the need to \u201cprotect\u201d Devin throughout their relationship, despite his hesitation to talk about certain topics like politics.",
      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn't get to. We just didn't get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn't get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Additionally, Virginia revealed that Devin got a check for a wedding present, but failed to tell her about the gift. Instead, found out from his mother.",
      "\u201cI was just waiting to see if he would bring it up but he didn't. It made me not so trusting of him,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cIf my truth in that moment was to not get married, then that was my truth in that moment. I don't regret my decision,\u201d she said.",
      "In his own confessional interview, Devin said he felt \u201ckind of lost\u201d and was struggling to understand Virginia's decision.",
      "\u201cEven though I didn\u2019t get married today,\u00a0I still do believe that love is blind, because I felt that love for Virginia regardless of everything that happened,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0The Haydee Guesthouse, with its worn-out carpets and grandmotherly Victorian fa\u00e7ade, makes for an unlikely base for Russian-backed high-stakes espionage.",
      "But for years, the guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a run-down resort town on Britain\u2019s east coast, played host to a freelance spy ring orchestrating cross-continental honeytraps, kidnappings and murder plots\u00a0targeting high-profile dissidents and sensitive military sites.",
      "The details, which seem pulled straight from a spy novel, unfolded in British courts last week after three Bulgarians \u2014 members of a Russian ring operating from their base in the United Kingdom \u2014 were found guilty of conspiracy to spy.",
      "Gabriela Gaberova, 30, a beautician tapped to carry out honeytraps; Katrin Ivanova, 33, a lab assistant who was also found guilty of \u201cpossessing identity documents with improper intention\u201d; and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, a painter-decorator and Gaberova\u2019s former partner, made up the ragtag group of amateur operatives who managed to carry out espionage operations for the Kremlin on what prosecutors described as \u201can industrial scale.\u201d",
      "Their handler, a fellow Bulgarian named Biser Dzhambazov, called himself \u201cMad Max\u201d and doubled as a medical courier as well as a knot in the spy ring\u2019s tangled romantic subplot.",
      "Dzhambazov lived with Ivanova before ending their long-term relationship after developing feelings for Gaberova. When police raided the beautician\u2019s northwest London flat in February 2023, they found Dzhambazov and Gaberova in bed together.",
      "Their ringleader was a fifth Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, part spy, part IT specialist, who adopted the name \u201cJackie Chan\u201d in messages to his sidekick, Dzhambazov.",
      "Roussev and Dzhambazov both pleaded guilty to espionage charges following their arrest in 2023.\u00a0A sixth Bulgarian, a mixed martial arts fighter code-named \u201cThe Destroyer,\u201d real name Ivan Stoyanov, also admitted to spying for Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, Roussev\u2019s \u201cminions\u201d \u2014 whom he named after the yellow characters from the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d animated series \u2014 denied the charges.",
      "Instead of being part of the cartoon villain Gru\u2019s scheme, these defendants were real-life operatives working for the Russian intelligence service, also named GRU.",
      "From 2020 to 2023, the gang carried out a series of chaotic and often disorganized covert missions, one of which targeted Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist renowned for exposing Russian involvement in\u00a0the poisoning of MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal with the Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury, England, in March 2018.",
      "The group tracked his movements across Austria, Montenegro and Spain, even considering a honeytrap, with Gaberova potentially involved in the scheme.",
      "In 2022, they surveilled Roman Dobrokhotov, a journalist critical of Russia, with discussions of a possible kidnapping. Telegram messages show the group followed him from Budapest to Berlin before losing him at passport control.",
      "In another bizarre plot, the group planned to spray the Kazakh Embassy in London with what Britain\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service described as \u201clarge quantities of fake pig\u2019s blood.\u201d They also schemed to create a false opposition group to stage a protest outside the embassy and feed the sham information about the fake group to Kazakh intelligence in order to boost Russia\u2019s image.",
      "The group also tracked Kirill Kachur, a former Russian official, in Montenegro, planning a kidnapping. They surveilled a U.S. military base in Stuttgart, Germany, focusing on Ukrainian forces. Additionally, they conducted covert operations against former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliyev, attempting to access his residence and gather intelligence.",
      "Investigators uncovered a trove of over 200,000 messages between the operatives, as well as spy equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars, including cameras hidden in pens and ties, and videos showing the group surveilling specific sites of interest.",
      "In addition to espionage, the group was implicated in broader Russian efforts to influence foreign political climates and destabilize rival nations.",
      "The three defendants will be held in custody until sentencing in May.",
      "Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Scotland Yard\u2019s SO15, which deals with state threats, said it was one of the U.K.\u2019s largest espionage investigations of the last 15 years.",
      "Prosecutors said\u00a0the group was directed by alleged Russian agent\u00a0Jan Marsalek, an Austrian national\u00a0who had contact with Russian intelligence agencies.",
      "The shadowy former chief operating officer of Wirecard, who is wanted in Germany and subject to an Interpol red notice,\u00a0had fled to\u00a0Russia, where he allegedly ran the Bulgarian network.",
      "Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnapping and murder of both Grozev and Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until falling out with the Kremlin.",
      "Gaberova, Ivanchev and Ivanova claimed they didn\u2019t know whom they were working for, or that they were lied to by their superiors.",
      "\u201cThis prolonged activity also undermined the security and safety of the UK,\u201d the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement, \u201cand there can be no doubt that each of the defendants knew exactly who they were spying for.\u201d",
      "Russia has been linked to numerous covert operations in the U.K. in recent years as part of its broader efforts to undermine Western security and influence global politics.",
      "In 2022, a 55-page\u00a0report from the Intelligence and Security Committee\u00a0of Parliament said the the country is a target of Russian disinformation, and described Russian influence in Britain as \u201cthe new normal.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "VANNES, France \u2014 For more than three decades, St\u00e9phanie kept a dark secret: The \u201cadored\u201d doctor who had been like a second father had repeatedly raped her when she was a child.",
      "Now 46, she is one of three victims who shared their stories about her alleged abuser, Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a once highly respected surgeon who is now standing trial in what is considered France\u2019s largest ever pedophilia case, charged with raping or sexually abusing 299 people, all of them former patients and most of them children under the age of 15.",
      "\u201cHe took me to dance class, to flute competitions,\u201d St\u00e9phanie said in one of a series of interviews last month. \u201cHe raped me in the car.\u201d",
      "\u201cI never spoke up when I was a child,\u201d she said, adding that she hoped sharing her experience would help other victims of abuse to find \u201cthe strength to break free and speak out.\u201d",
      "The closest she came to telling her family about her abuse was in January 2017, after her sister Christine died in a car crash at age 56. But she stayed silent for the same reason she always had \u2014 to protect her mother.",
      "Instead, she said, she wrote a long letter detailing how Le Scouarnec, once a close family friend, had repeatedly raped her, and slipped it into Christine\u2019s coffin.",
      "Now an office manager with a 14-year-old son, St\u00e9phanie said she will\u00a0testify against Le Scouarnec, who is currently serving a 15-year sentence for the abuse of four other children and whose current trial opened late last month in the picturesque town of Vannes.",
      "NBC News does not name victims of sexual abuse unless they are willing to be publicly identified. Stephanie and one of the other interviewees agreed to the use of their first names.",
      "Le Scouarnec began abusing her in 1985 when she was just 6, St\u00e9phanie said, adding that it began after she started staying at his family home near Loches, a quaint medieval town around 200 miles east of Vannes.",
      "Le Scouarnec invited St\u00e9phanie to stay at his family home after her father died of a heart attack at age 52. It looked like he was helping out her mother, now 89, who had four older daughters and worked with him as a medical assistant at a private clinic.",
      "Living in the same home as Le Scouarnec, his then-wife Marie-France Lhermitte, now 71, and their three sons, all of whom are younger than St\u00e9phanie, she said the abuse started immediately.",
      "Lhermitte testified that she knew \u201cnothing\u201d of her husband\u2019s 30-year history of abusing children, including members of their family, until his arrest in 2017. Her sons, ages 44, 42 and 38, told the court they did not suspect anything at the time.",
      "St\u00e9phanie said some of her memories, like times and dates of the abuse, are patchy. But like many of his victims, she was able to fill in the blanks because Le Scouarnec carefully chronicled his abuse in digital diaries he kept on hard drives, which were seized by police when they raided his home in May 2017, according to testimony in court. Some of the diary entries have been projected onto a screen in the courtroom.",
      "Dating back to the mid-1980s they show that the majority of his victims \u2014 256 \u2014 were under age 15 at the time they were assaulted. The average age of the alleged victims in the current trial \u2014 158 male and 141 female \u2014 is 11. Most were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery.",
      "Each time she visited Le Scouarnec\u2019s home, St\u00e9phanie said she knew what was going to happen, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel I can refuse.\u201d Although she resisted a few times, she said he told her, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything bad.\u201d",
      "Other victims have also recounted hearing those words.",
      "For years, \u201cthere was a lot of suffering, shame,\u201d she said, adding that the abuse stopped when she was around 12, after she changed schools and declined to sleep at his house. \u201cI got older,\u201d she said. \u201cI am out of the Le Scouarnec prison.\u201d",
      "But St\u00e9phanie said she didn\u2019t have the courage to tell anyone. She credited several years of therapy she sought as an adult with helping her to rebuild her confidence. \u201cBeing freed from this secret buried for so many years was the beginning of my reconstruction,\u201d she said.",
      "While her mother was unaware of the abuse, one of Le Scouarnec\u2019s nieces, Alexandra, 47, said she did speak up, but he was protected by \u201cthe silence of incest.\u201d",
      "Now a nurse, Alexandra said she thought she was her uncle\u2019s first victim, adding that he started abusing her around 1982, when she was 5. Le Scouarnec, she said, would prey on her during piano lessons and sleepovers at his house, often when other family members were present in the home.",
      "Some of the assaults took place in the bathroom, leaving her scared to go, she said, adding that she was also left terrified of medical exams. One one occasion, she said, she screamed \u201cto death like a hysteric\u201d and had to be held down as a doctor approached her.",
      "Alexandra said she was 20 when she told her mother about the abuse after hearing that Le Scouarnec had locked himself and a little girl in a bathroom two years earlier.",
      "But although her mom confronted her sister, Lhermitte, Alexandra said she balked at confronting Le Scouarnec himself.",
      "\u201cThis person was so highly regarded in our family that she [felt she] didn\u2019t have the right to go up to him and say, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d she added.",
      "Calling Alexandra \u201cdevious,\u201d Lhermitte denied in court that she knew about the abuse until her husband\u2019s arrest. Le Scouarnec\u2019s diaries, however, refer to the \u201ccataclysm\u201d that resulted in 1996 when \u201cshe\u201d learned \u201cI\u2019m a pedophile.\u201d Investigators said the \u201cshe\u201d he was referring to was Lhermitte.",
      "Alexandra\u2019s cousin, 34, whom NBC News has agreed not to name, said she feared the \u201ctsunami\u201d she would trigger if she told police about the things her uncle began doing to her at age 3.",
      "\u201cWe come from a family that doesn\u2019t make waves,\u201d she said, adding that eventually she told her mother and older sister in October 2000, when she was 10.",
      "In emotional court testimony late last month, the cousin\u2019s mother, Annie, 72, said she confronted her brother, who immediately confessed. Asked by Presiding Judge Aude Buresi why she didn\u2019t go to the police, she said she thought her daughter \u201cwas the only victim and it would never happen again.\u201d But in 2017, she said she learned from police that her older daughter, now 39, had also been abused.",
      "St\u00e9phanie and Alexandra, who are due to testify Monday, have disputed Lhermitte\u2019s claim that she was unaware of the abuse, as had Alexandra\u2019s cousin.",
      "Alexandra called her account \u201ca pack of lies.\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s brother Patrick Le Scouarnec, 70, told the court by video link last week that Lhermitte knew about her husband\u2019s actions during the same period. \u201cThere\u2019s one person who could have had my brother arrested and that\u2019s his wife, Marie-France,\u201d he said.",
      "In France, defendants may respond to witnesses if the judge allows it, and Le Scouarnec admitted that he carried out \u201chideous\u201d crimes. After Annie\u2019s testimony, he told the court that he could not \u201cmake up for the harm I have done to my niece.\u201d",
      "For the first time he also admitted to abusing his granddaughter and that he used his \u201cstatus as a doctor\u201d to assault kids. His \u201cpedophile activity had no impact on my professional activity,\u201d he told the court in a subsequent declaration.",
      "His lawyer, Maxime Tessier, has said he has not admitted to all of the facts of the case.",
      "If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the\u00a0 15 years he is already serving\u00a0 for the rape\u00a0of two of his nieces, a young patient and a 6-year-old neighbor, whose parents reported the attack to police in 2017.",
      "He was also convicted in 2005 of possessing thousands of images depicting child abuse that he downloaded from an internet site monitored by the FBI. He was given a four-month suspended sentence but was nonetheless allowed to carry on working at\u00a0 numerous public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France.",
      "When reports \u201cexploded\u201d in the press in the summer of 2019 that Le Scouarnec may have sexually abused scores of children, St\u00e9phanie said she decided tell her mother that the respected doctor she was flattered to call a friend had raped her too.",
      "\u201cI protected my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought that a little girl who just lost her daddy would accuse a surgeon of raping her.\u201d",
      "Her mother \u201cbelieved me straight away,\u201d she said, adding that her mom felt enormously guilty and told her \u201cshe\u2019d blame herself for the rest of her life.\u201d",
      "The crimes against St\u00e9phanie and Alexandra\u00a0occurred too long ago to be prosecuted under French law. Calling for more support for victims of sexual abuse, both said they hoped France would extend the statute of limitations and toughen penalties for pedophiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real public health issue\u201d that \u201csociety as a whole\u201d must confront, St\u00e9phanie said.",
      "The women said they were inspired by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who emerged as an icon of strength in France after she allowed her mass rape trial to be opened to the public last year.",
      "\u201cI had to fight to be the person I am today,\u201d St\u00e9phanie said. \u201cWe need to help victims rebuild their lives.\u201d",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org. States often have child abuse hotlines, but if you suspect a child\u2019s life is in imminent danger, call 911.",
      "If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, call the\u00a0National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline\u00a0at\u00a01-800-656-4673. The hotline, run by the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN), can put you in contact with your local rape crisis center.

      "Syrian security forces and affiliated gunmen killed more than 340 civilians over the last two days, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based war monitoring group said Saturday.",
      "The SOHR compared the bloodshed to operations carried out under Assad\u2019s brutal regime and framed the killings as a collective act of revenge, adding that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus, an Assad stronghold. NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "In addition, SOHR said that some 50 government troops and 45 Assad loyalists have been killed in the fighting.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed the bodies of dozens of men piled on a blood-soaked street in the small town of Latakia, another Assad stronghold on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast.",
      "Women gathered around the bloodied corpses, wailing and clutching the dead. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",

      "Just over two weeks ago, it was his turn. Early on Feb. 18, Hathleen, 25, was still asleep at his family home in the village of Umm Al-Kheir on the outskirts of Masafer Yatta in the Israeli-occupied West Bank when his mother raced into the room, terrified. Israeli soldiers and excavators were outside, she yelled.",
      "Less than half an hour later, they were standing outside their home, watching in horror as an excavator tore through the building, crushing its walls to rubble and snapping its metal roof in half.",
      "Asked to comment on the incident on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces were unable to provide a response as of Friday afternoon local time.",
      "Masafer Yatta\u2019s landscape of rolling hills and small hamlets gained renewed international attention when \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary by Basel Adra, a Palestinian activist, and Yuval Abraham, an Israeli investigative journalist, won an Oscar on Sunday.",
      "The film highlighted the violence and abuses committed by Israeli forces and settlers against Palestinians in Masafer Yatta \u2014 but Hathleen said he feared it could \u201copen the gates of hell\u201d for those who lived there, worried that Israeli settlers and forces might increase their attacks in angry retaliation for the film.",
      "Hathleen said he believed it was important to highlight the reality Palestinians face in the occupied West Bank, but in the weeks since the documentary was announced as an Academy Award nominee, he said there had been fresh violence in the area, with Amnesty International warning last week that another village nearby was under \u201cimminent threat of forcible transfer.\u201d",
      "Hathleen, a physical therapist and activist, now sleeps in a large tent outside his brother\u2019s house with other relatives. They feared rebuilding their home only to have it torn down again by Israeli forces, while the threat of a violent settler attack hangs over him and his family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard, but what should we do?\u201d he said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cThis is what they want\u00a0\u2014 to kick us out of our land.\u201d",
      "Like Hathleen, Mohammad Hureini, the son of prominent activist Hafez Hureini, who has made headlines for his fight to remain in At-Tuwani in Masafer Yatta, said he was glad the documentary was bringing \u201cgood attention to the situation.\u201d But, Hureini, 20, an activist and university student studying English literature, added:  \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to stop what Israel is committing.\u201d",
      "Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers and forces has soared since the start of the war in Gaza. According to OCHA, the United Nations\u2019 humanitarian aid agency, at least 895 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between Oct. 7, 2023, and March 4 of this year. So far this year, 89 Palestinians in the territory have been killed, with 17 of them children under the age of 19.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since the\u00a01967 Six Day War, with Israeli settlers building and expanding Jewish settlements there that have been condemned as illegal under international humanitarian law and counter to U.N. Security Council resolutions, a charge Israel rejects.",
      "Masafar Yatta has been a focus of Israeli demolitions since the 1980s, after the Israeli military declared the area a restricted military zone, dubbing it \u201cFiring Zone 918.\u201d A decadeslong legal battle saw the displacement and return of Palestinian families to the area, but that ended in May 2022, when Israel\u2019s High Court of Justice authorized the state to demolish villages in the area and expel its residents.",
      "OCHA has called forced evictions resulting from demolitions a  \u201cgross violation of human rights,\u201d while human rights organizations including Israel-based Peace Now and B\u2019Tselem have condemned Israel\u2019s mounting destruction of Palestinian homes in the area.",
      "\u201cThe Israeli government concocts one excuse after the other to expel Palestinians from their land,\u201d Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch, told NBC News over WhatsApp on Thursday.",
      "Accepting the award for best documentary at the Oscars, Adra, who co-directed \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d called on the international community to \u201ctake serious actions to stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to have members of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza killed if hostages are not immediately released.",
      "\"'Shalom Hamas' means Hello and Goodbye \u2014 You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cI have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance,\u201d he added. \u201cAlso, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\u201d",
      "The White House said in a statement that Trump met Wednesday with eight hostages released from Gaza: Iair\u00a0Horn, Omer\u00a0Shem Tov, Eli\u00a0Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama\u00a0Levy, Doron\u00a0Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The administration is engaging in direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Wednesday.",
      "Trump believes the dialogue is part of\u00a0a \"good-faith effort to do what\u2019s right for the American people,\" Leavitt said at a White House news briefing.",
      "\"There are American lives at stake,\" she added, saying Israel had been consulted.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem responded to Trump's comments, telling Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu Agency \"These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation not to implement its terms.\"",
      "\"There is an agreement that was signed and Washington was a mediator in it, which includes the release of all prisoners in 3 stages,\" Qassem added, \"and Hamas has implemented what it was required to do in the first stage, while Israel is evading the second stage.\"",
      "The six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended Saturday with no extension of peace negotiations in sight. It is the first time the United States has held direct talks with the group, which it has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Axios first reported the talks between the United States and Hamas.",
      "Asked whether the scope of the talks included Trump's proposal to take over Gaza, Leavitt said she would not go into details and referred questions to the State Department.",
      "Initially, the idea for a second phase of a ceasefire included Hamas\u2019 releasing more hostages in return for Israel's withdrawing from the Palestinian territory, with the aim of ending the war.",
      "But with no talks continuing, Israel reinstated a halt in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza after the initial phase of the ceasefire ended. Hamas then accused Israel of violating their agreement by \u201cevading the commitment to end the war and withdraw completely from Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israel recently approved a plan from the\u00a0U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0that would have continued the first stage of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover instead of proceeding to the second phase of peace talks.",
      "Witkoff's plan called for the release of half of the\u00a0remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, on the first day and the remaining hostages once a permanent ceasefire deal is reached, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "But Hamas rejected the proposal, saying it didn't honor the original, multiphased ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these positions by the United States strengthened the position of the Zionist right within the government and pushed for taking punitive steps, including closing the crossings in this manner and using the starvation policy against the people of the Gaza Strip,\" the group\u2019s spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said in a statement Sunday.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Sunday that Israel has \"negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "Hughes added that the United States will support Israel's decision on next steps \"given Hamas has indicated it\u2019s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.\"",
      "On Monday, Netanyahu warned Hamas in remarks before the Knesset, Israel's legislature, that if the group didn't release more hostages, \"there will be consequences beyond your imagination. We are preparing for the next stages of the campaign \u2014 not everything is visible, and that\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "The Biden administration announced initial ceasefire in January just days before Trump's inauguration. It required a pause of Israel's military operations in Gaza and the release of both living and dead hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "State media on Saturday released photos showing what it called \u201ca nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine,\u201d as it reported leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s visits to major shipyards where warships are built.",
      "The Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, didn\u2019t provide details on the submarine, but said Kim was briefed on its construction.",
      "The naval vessel appears to be a 6,000-ton-class or 7,000-ton-class one which can carry about 10 missiles, said Moon Keun-sik, a South Korean submarine expert who teaches at Seoul\u2019s Hanyang University. He said the use of the term \u201cthe strategic guided missiles\u201d meant it would carry nuclear-capable weapons.",
      "\u201cIt would be absolutely threatening to us and the U.S.,\u201d Moon said.",
      "A nuclear-powered submarine was among a long wishlist of sophisticated weaponry that Kim vowed to introduce during a major political conference in 2021 to cope with what he called escalating U.S.-led military threats. Other weapons were\u00a0solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles,\u00a0hypersonic weapons, spy satellites and\u00a0multi-warhead missiles.\u00a0North Korea has since performed a run of testing activities to acquire them.",
      "North Korea obtaining a greater ability to fire missiles from underwater is a worrying development because it\u2019s difficult for its rivals to detect such launches in advance.",
      "Questions about how North Korea, a heavily sanctioned and impoverished country, could get resources and technology to build nuclear-powered submarines have surfaced.",

      "He also said North Korea could launch the submarine in one or two years to test its capability before its actual deployment.",
      "North Korea has an estimated 70-90 diesel-powered submarines in one of the world\u2019s largest fleets. However, they are mostly aging ones capable of launching only torpedoes and mines, not missiles.",
      "In 2023, North Korea said it had launched what it called its first\u00a0\u201ctactical nuclear attack submarine,\u201d\u00a0but foreign experts doubted the North\u2019s announcement and speculated it was likely a diesel-powered submarine disclosed in 2019. Moon said there has been no confirmation that it has been deployed.",
      "North Korea has conducted a slew of\u00a0underwater-launched ballistic missile tests\u00a0since 2016, but all launches were made from the same 2,000-ton-class submarine which has a single launch tube. Many experts call it a test platform, rather than an operational submarine in active service.",

      "Russian strikes on Ukraine have killed at least 20 people, officials said Saturday, as heavy aerial attacks continued into the second night following a U.S. decision to\u00a0stop sharing satellite images\u00a0with Ukraine.",
      "The decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of\u00a0a tempestuous White House visit\u00a0last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Without U.S. satellite imagery, Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike inside Russia and defend itself from bombardment is\u00a0significantly diminished.",
      "At least 11 people were killed in multiple strikes on a town in Ukraine\u2019s embattled Donetsk region late Friday, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The attack damaged eight apartment blocks in the town of Dobropillya, which is close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances. Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said a Russian drone damaged a Ukrainian fire truck while rescuers fought to extinguish the burning buildings.",
      "Another six people were killed in the front-line towns of Pokrovsk, Kostyantynivka, Myrnograd and Ivanopillya, Filashkin said, while emergency services reported that three others died when a Russian drone hit a civilian workshop in the northeastern Kharkiv region.",
      "Filashkin declared Saturday a day of mourning in the region and warned that more victims could still be found in the rubble.",
      "Zelenskyy said at least five children were among the injured in Dobropillya. \u201cLast night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers. It is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort.\u201d",
      "The wave of attacks took place just 24 hours after Russia hit Ukrainian energy facilities with dozens of missiles and drones, hobbling its ability to deliver heat and light to its citizens and to power weapons factories vital to its defenses.",
      "The barrage came after the U.S.\u00a0suspended military aid and intelligence\u00a0to Ukraine to pressure it into accepting a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration.",
      "When asked Friday by a reporter during an Oval Office exchange if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, President Donald Trump responded: \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what anybody else would.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy did not reference the intelligence-sharing deal, but did seem to appeal to other statements Trump made Friday related to financial sanctions against Moscow. Writing on social media, the U.S. president\u00a0proposed imposing large-scale\u00a0banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and final peace settlement was reached.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the prospect of additional sanctions on Moscow, saying, \u201cEverything that helps Putin finance the war must be broken.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The same day Geslain Luma, a 29-year-old Haitian immigrant, learned he was granted temporary protected status to remain in the United States was the same day President Donald Trump announced plans to cut the program short.",
      "Figuring out his future with \u201cthe end of TPS gives me a headache,\u201d Luma said.",
      "For more than 15 years, TPS has allowed thousands of Haitians to work legally in the U.S. and avoid deportation while their homeland grapples with political instability, gang violence and economic hardship.",
      "Since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021, armed gangs have gained control over much of Port-au-Prince, creating a power vacuum that has made governing a challenge and fueled further violence, homelessness and starvation. More than 5,600 people were killed and 1,400 were kidnapped amid gang conflicts last year, according to the United Nations. The violence has rendered 1 million people homeless in Haiti, forcing many into makeshift shelters and exacerbating the country\u2019s economic challenges.",
      "But with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end TPS by August 2025, an estimated 500,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. face an uncertain future, forced to decide whether to stay and fight for legal status or prepare for a return to a country in crisis.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment.",
      "In and around New York City, where at least 160,000 Haitian people live, Brooklyn\u2019s Haitian community has formed deep roots while also sharing fears of deportation. Evangelical Crusade Christian Church in the Flatbush neighborhood has served as a sanctuary for Haitian immigrants for at least five decades, providing a range of services, including food pantries, wellness events and legal assistance.",
      "\u201cThe community is worried,\u201d said the Rev. Samuel Nicolas, the church\u2019s senior pastor. \u201cFor over 15 years, these individuals have built their lives here, believing TPS would eventually lead to permanent residency. Now, they are watching that hope slip away.\u201d",
      "Many fled the country after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, killing more than 200,000 people and leaving an estimated 1.3 million people homeless. In the aftermath, people arrived in the U.S. and gained TPS protection, seeking stability that allowed them to rebuild their lives. But the program was never meant to be a permanent solution.",
      "Abigail Desravines, a 35-year-old Haitian immigrant, came to the U.S. following the earthquake.",
      "\u201cThe conditions were getting worse and worse,\u201d Desravines recalled. Family members in the U.S. \u201cwere calling, asking what we were going to do. We told them we wanted to come here for school because I could not stay in Haiti for school. I lost classmates. There was a lot of loss.\u201d",
      "Desravines said TPS allowed her and her sister to build a life in the U.S., and she eventually earned a green card. Despite the protection it offered, Desravines said living under TPS still involved hurdles and instability.",
      "\u201cPeople think TPS is a free pass, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Desravines said. \u201cYou have to keep renewing, pay fees and live with the fear that it could end at any time. It\u2019s not an easy path.\u201d",
      "On top of paying fees, some colleges require TPS holders to pay tuition \u201cout of pocket like international students,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we lived in the U.S. for years, some colleges did not allow us in-state tuition.\u201d",
      "Desravines\u2019 parents remained in Haiti while she and her sister lived with extended family and continued their education. While adjusting to life in the U.S., the sisters quietly shouldered the burdens of work, studies and immigration uncertainties, without adding further stress to their parents as they dealt with the earthquake\u2019s aftermath.",
      "\u201cMy parents had their own struggles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come to the U.S., and we did not want our parents to worry. But it affected us emotionally, and it did affect our grades.\u201d",
      "The end of the program will create a disruption, as many TPS holders have jobs, attend school and are parts of their communities.",
      "For those now facing the threat of deportation, the prospect of returning to Haiti is daunting. The country remains plagued by instability, and Nicolas said he believes sending people back under these conditions is inhumane.",
      "\u201cHaiti is not in a place where people with TPS or those under humanitarian programs can return,\u201d he said. \u201cHaiti is being overrun by armed groups and the infrastructure is barely functioning.\u201d",
      "Luma, the new TPS recipient, said he has also applied for asylum and holds a work permit, which is valid until 2029. However, his legal status is not guaranteed \u2014 in 2027, a judge will decide his asylum claim.",
      "\u201cWhen you appear before a judge, you never know what decision they will make, so TPS would have been an extra layer of security in a difficult situation,\u201d he said. Luma said he was concerned for friends and relatives who rely solely on TPS.",
      "\u201cA person with only TPS works, buys a car, buys a house, and now all their documents will expire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no choice but to self-deport because there\u2019s no way to live without legal documents.\u201d",
      "Many immigrants send money for food, education and health care to their families in Haiti, Nicolas said. \u201cIf they are deported, that financial support will disappear, worsening Haiti\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\u201d",
      "Nicolas said the deportations will also have a social and economic impact in the States.",
      "\u201cHaitians are part of the fabric of New York,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fill our churches, they work in jobs others won\u2019t take, they contribute to our economy. If TPS ends, it won\u2019t just be a Haitian problem, it will be a New York problem and a national problem.\u201d",
      "Immigrant advocacy groups are calling for legislative action to protect TPS holders, pushing for a pathway to residency for those who have lived in the U.S. for years. A group of organizations filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to end TPS for Haitians early. Nicolas said he hopes Congress steps in to provide relief, or that Trump has a change of heart.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that our president will have a compassionate heart and recognize that Haiti is not a place these people can return to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere would they go? What infrastructure is in place for them? If we call ourselves a nation built on Christian values, then we must act with compassion.\u201d"

      "Donald Tusk added that Poland would also drastically expand its arsenal, saying the country \u201cmust pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons.\"",
      "Tusk unveiled the plans in a speech to the Polish Parliament on the same day that President Donald Trump, after weeks of weakening U.S. support for Ukraine and traditional European allies, threatened to impose expanded \u201clarge scale\u201d sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it reaches a peace agreement with Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats,\" Tusk said.",
      "Many of Poland's leaders were shocked when Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago. Once behind the so-called Iron Curtain under Communism and controlled by the Soviet Union, Poland is a longtime enemy of Russia.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the need to have an army of half-a-million in Poland, including the reservists,\u201d he said.",
