      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Clowns complete with red noses and tutus delivered the joy of Carnival to sick children in a Rio de Janeiro hospital on Tuesday, bringing the ebullient festivities normally found on the streets straight to the young patients and their caregivers.",
      "Street parties, known as blocos, are a fixture of Rio\u2019s Carnival celebrations. They\u2019re raucous, rambunctious romps with thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of partygoers.",
      "The vibrant chaos of Carnival street parties was, of course, unsuitable for sick children, so members of the Clown Circle project brought a gentler celebration to the State Servants Hospital in downtown Rio.",
      "Musicians, clowns and even a standard-bearer danced their way through the corridors decorated with streamers and masks, inviting children, parents, nurses and doctors into a merry dance and moment of celebration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really good feeling, because staying in a hospital with a child is tiring,\u201d said Moniky Fernanda de Nazare\u0301 Moreira, as she balanced her one-year-old son on her hip. \u201cWe need this to cheer the child up \u2013 and he loves a bit of a mess, so he had a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "While the trumpet, drum and banjo players played classic Carnival tunes, the clowns sought to create an individual interaction with each child, paying them a kind of attention that for once wasn\u2019t medical.",
      "\u201cIt really helps children improve,\u201d said Ioma Rodrigues Klemz, a doctor on the ward. \u201cYou see children who are sometimes very withdrawn in bed who start to communicate more, sing, dance,\u201d she added.",
      "The saying goes that laughter is the best medicine, and clown projects in hospitals even bring joy to hospitals in war-torn places such as Ukraine.",
      "The Clown Circle project in Rio offers weekly activities, creating themed performances around calendar events like Carnival.",
      "In Brazil, Carnival officially ended with Ash Wednesday last week, but such technicalities didn\u2019t stop the cheerful group. However, they adapt to the hospital environment, adjusting aspects like volume, explained Julia Schaeffer, a program coordinator.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about; bringing the street party into the hospital for those who can\u2019t be out,\" Schaeffer said. \u201cWe bring it here with an extra dose of care.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case.",
      "Just how the reprise of the disgraced movie mogul's prosecution plays out should come into focus on Wednesday, when a judge is set to issue rulings on a variety of issues, including the scope of accuser testimony and potential expert witnesses.",
      "Weinstein, 72, is expected to be in court when Judge Curtis Farber rules.",
      "His retrial is scheduled to start April 15 in state court in Manhattan \u2014 nearly a year after New York\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction on rape and sexual assault charges.",
      "At his last court appearance, in January, Weinstein implored Farber to start the retrial sooner. He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to prosecutors just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case.",
      "Prosecutors said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after the state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out his conviction last April.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "Last month, Weinstein added Jennifer Bonjean, a lawyer who has represented Bill Cosby and R. Kelly, to a legal team that includes defense attorneys Arthur Aidala, Diana Fabi Samson and former judge Barry Kamins.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "A proposed 100,000-seater arena would surpass Wembley as the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Under the plans, the 20-time English champion said it would build next to its iconic Old Trafford ground, likely meaning it would not need to relocate during the construction process.",
      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",
      "United did not say how much the stadium would cost or reveal a timeline for its completion, but architect Norman Foster said building work would take five years.",

      "The possibility of redeveloping Old Trafford, one of the most iconic stadiums in soccer, was considered but an entirely new construction was the preferred option.",
      "\u201cToday marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world\u2019s greatest football stadium,\u201d Ratcliffe said.",
      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",
      "Wembley is currently the biggest stadium in the U.K., with a capacity of 90,000, and is home to England\u2019s national soccer team.",

      "\u201cOur long-term objective as a club is to have the world\u2019s best football team playing in the world\u2019s best stadium,\" United chief executive Omar Berrada said.",
      "Managerial great Alex Ferguson said the club \"must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\"",
      "The announcement came days after thousands of United fans marched in protest against the club's ownership in the face of cost cuts, ticket price rises and ongoing failure on the field.",
      "United is majority owned by the American Glazer family, which also owns the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Upon investing, Ratcliffe vowed to return the once-dominant club back to the summit of European soccer after more than a decade since it last won the Premier League.",
      "But his first year in charge of soccer operations has been turbulent. United endured its worst-ever Premier League season last year and is on course to set a new low this term, with the team currently languishing in the bottom half of the standings.",

      "Overseas, \u201cMickey 17\u201d has already made $34.2 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.3 million. But profitability for the film is a long way off: It cost a reported $118 million to produce, which does not account for millions spent on marketing and promotion.",

But despite all of that, and reviews that were mostly positive (79% on RottenTomatoes), audiences did not treat it as an event movie, and it may ultimately struggle to break even.",
      "Originally set for release in March 2024, Bong Joon Ho\u2019s follow-up to the Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d faced several delays, which he has attributed to extenuating circumstances around the Hollywood strikes.

      "The company said this week that the AI-assisted dubbing \u2013 which refers to the practice of replacing an original audio track with a translated language \u2013 will be offered for licensed titles that previously lacked dubbing, such as the 2003 animated film \u201cEl Cid: La Leyenda.\u201d",
      "The Seattle-based company said its AI-aided dubbing service will be in English and Latin American Spanish. Initially, it will be offered for 12 licensed titles.",
      "Amazon says the program will take a hybrid approach, allowing \u201clocal processionals to collaborate with AI to ensure quality control.\u201d",
      "Other tech companies have also introduced AI-powered dubbing into their platforms. Last year, YouTube released a feature that allows content creators to translate their videos into multiple languages. Meta, meanwhile, said in September that it was testing an AI tool that will automatically translate voices in Reels."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even pinpoint a single emotion because I feel that it changes like every five minutes,\u201d she told The Associated Press, still buzzing a day after her debut. \u201cI woke up and I still sort of felt in the world of Oz.\u201d",
      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",
      "Kebede had already gone through an emotional wringer by the time the curtain finally came down. She sings the Act 1 showstopper \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d shooting into the air and the power of the moment ripped through her.",
      "\u201cWhen the lights went off at the end of the song, I started sobbing. Not like just a gentle tear. Viscerally, I had to release,\u201d she says.",
      "\"I really felt like I was flying, is the simplest way to put it. I felt like I\u2019m doing it myself, though my own power \u2014 my vocal power, my emotional power, the power of all of my African ancestors.\"",

      "\u201cEveryone deserves a chance to fly,\u201d says Kebede. \u201cI'm projecting this message that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you deserve liberation and you deserve empowerment in the way that the character feels in that moment. It just feels like I\u2019m taking the entire audience in my arms.\u201d",

Over Christmas, it took in a staggering $5 million over nine performances, marking the highest weekly gross in history for any Broadway show.",

      "Others who have played the role over the years include Shoshana Bean, Stephanie J. Block, Jessica Vosk, Eden Espinosa, Ana Gasteyer and, of course, Idina Menzel, who won a Tony Award in the role in 2004.",
      "Kebede graduated from Occidental College in 2016 with a double major of diplomacy & world affairs and politics, intending on a career in law or public policy. By her senior year, she had an itch she needed to scratch.",
      "\u201cI just had this creative craving in terms of storytelling in the theatrical way that I was missing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I sat my mother down and I was like, \u2018Look, I think I need just a couple years to explore this creative endeavor.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cThe rigorous nature of touring, I think, prepared me immensely for this,\u201d she says. \u201cI do feel very equipped \u2014 physically, vocally, emotionally. I feel like I know how to take care of my body and my mind, how I need to cool down emotionally after such an intense experience for three hours.\u201d",
      "On debut night, Kebede tried to keep a set of mental screenshots, a reel of faces and feelings. As she turned to get backstage, she was feeling the love.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother and my father passed when I was in high school and I just took a moment to connect with my angels,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was, oh God, it was electric.\u201d",
      "Family came backstage after the show for photos and a tour, she was toasted at a nearby bar by friends, she finally ate something and then got home to try to sleep.",
      "\u201cMy battery was dead. I mean, I couldn\u2019t even move. I couldn\u2019t move my face. I was just drinking my tea, playing calming jazz. I had to just turn it off,\u201d she says.",

      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",
      "Closing out the Other Stage on the festival's Sunday night will be English electronic group The Prodigy, most famous for the pumping 1996 track \u201cFirestarter.\" The performance will be particularly poignant as it will mark the band's first at the festival since the death of frontman Keith Flint in 2019.",
      "Other acts include Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut, and the recently reformed U.S. pop group Scissor Sisters.",
      "There are no scheduled performers on the festivals first two days, Wednesday and Thursday, though many ad hoc events take place as attendees arrive and pitch up their tents.",
      "A lot of interest will focus on Manchester-formed The 1975, which is fronted by Matty Healy. The band has headlined various festivals in the United Kingdom \u2014 but not Glastonbury \u2014 and elsewhere, with controversial stage antics.",
      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",
      "While the price may be fixed, the mid-summer weather isn't. As always, the hopes of everyone going are the same: Please, no mudbath!"

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

      "Utah's governor intends to sign legislation making the state the first to ban fluoride in public water systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Government researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.",
      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "Dr. Marty Makary will answer questions from a Senate panel about his plans to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is set to answer Senate questions Thursday about his plans for the agency, which may soon be at the center of an administration plan to scrutinize vaccines, antidepressants and ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",
      "Among other issues facing the agency:",
      "\u2014 Pressure from anti-abortion groups to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone",
      "\u2014 Efforts to keep up with a wave of artificial intelligence-based medical systems",
      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",
      "In government ethics forms, Makary recently said he has cut financial ties with several companies that could be impacted by his work at FDA, including telehealth and drug companies that sell compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs.",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",
      "",
      "The AAP Red Book  --  an encyclopedia of pediatric infectious diseases  --  noted that U.S. experts concur with WHO recommendations on giving vitamin A to all children with measles, and recommends giving it once a day for 2 days at the following doses:",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "",
      "\"Again, if a child has measles, that vitamin A should be prescribed under the supervision of the physician to make sure that it is dosed appropriately,\" Hayes said.",
      "",
      "Still, both Hayes and Tan emphasized that vaccination is the only way to stop more measles outbreaks like the current one in west Texas, where 159 cases have been identified since late January, with 22 hospitalizations and one death  --  the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015.",
      "",
      "Tan said that the \"number of unvaccinated individuals is growing, and that basically increases the risk for spread of measles, because measles is one of the most contagious viruses.\"",
      "",
      "\"If we cannot get our vaccination rates up to where they were, we're going to continue to see these outbreaks,\" she added, and that could mean more deaths, as it's estimated that one to three children in 1,000 with measles will die.",

      "Measles can also cause complications after the initial illness has passed, including subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  --  a rare, though fatal, neurologic disease  --  and immunodeficiency, Hayes said.",
      "",
      "\"I always find measles extremely concerning because it is so contagious,\" Hayes said. There are \"so many individuals in this country who are not immune,\" such as infants under 1 year of age, who cannot be vaccinated yet, and individuals who are immunocompromised, she added. And there is a \"risk for very severe disease as well as complications  --  both acute complications as well as long-term complications  --  with this virus.\""

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case",
      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

It's not just about scientists losing their jobs or damaging the local economy their work indirectly supports \u2014 scientists around the country say it's about patient health.",
      "\u201cDiscoveries are going to be delayed, if they ever happen,\u201d said Dr. Kimryn Rathmell, former director of the National Cancer Institute.",
      "It\u2019s hard for patients to comprehend how they could lose an undiscovered cure.",
      "Yet \u201call the people out there who have, you know, sick parents, sick children, this is going to impact,\u201d said neuroscientist Richard Huganir of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The administration\u2019s unprecedented moves are upending the research engine that has made the U.S. \u201cthe envy of the world in terms of scientific innovation,\u201d said Georgetown University health policy expert Lawrence Gostin.",
      "Among the biggest blows, if it survives a court challenge: Massive cuts in funding from the National Institutes of Health that would cost jobs in every state, according to an analysis by The Associated Press with assistance from the nonprofit United for Medical Research.",
      "That\u2019s on top of mass firings of government workers, NIH delays in issuing grants and uncertainty about how many already funded studies are being canceled under the president's anti-diversity executive orders.",
      "Earlier this week, lawmakers pressured Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the nominee to become NIH director, about the turmoil. Bhattacharya said if confirmed, he'd look into it to ensure scientists employed by and funded by the agency \u201chave resources to do the lifesaving work they do.\u201d",
      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",
      "After years studying the SynGap1 gene, \u201cwe have what we think is a really great therapeutic\u201d almost ready to be tested in severely affected children. Huganir has applied for two new NIH grants key for moving toward those trials.",

      "NIH reviews of new grant applications have been delayed despite court rulings to end a government spending freeze, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly they can get back on track.",
      "\u201cEveryone I know is basically freaking out because we suddenly don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to keep our labs open,\u201d said neuroscientist Rebecca Shansky at Boston\u2019s Northeastern University, who\u2019s awaiting word on grants for her study of how the brain processes pain and trauma.",

Some already have, even though studying different populations is fundamental to medicine.",
      "\u201cThose studies are very much threatened right now. People don\u2019t know what the rules are,\u201d said well-known Hopkins specialist Dr. Otis Brawley. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to kill people is what it amounts to, because we\u2019re not studying how to get appropriate care to all people.\u201d",

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "Jackie Chen was part of a group of social workers who often carried a loudspeaker seeking to mediate between police and protesters during the social unrest. She was freed at her first trial in September 2020, but the secretary of justice appealed and a court ordered a retrial by another judge.",
      "In the retrial, the prosecution accused Chen, who used a loudspeaker to ask police officers to calm down and not to use their guns to fire non-lethal bullets, of participating in a riot during a protest in August 2019. Chen pleaded not guilty.",
      "Judge May Chung wrote in her verdict that Chen had continuously shouted unfounded accusations against the police and suggested the officers' actions involved the use of excessive force or were too rapid. Chen had used her social worker role, claiming to be \u201csafeguarding justice,\" to back the protesters, the judge said.",

      "\u201cThrough the aforementioned means to gather together with other rioters, (she) thereby encouraged other rioters to commit acts that disturb social peace,\u201d she wrote.",

Last year, the government introduced amendments to the law that would allow the removal of a social worker's name from the register if he or she has been convicted of an offense that is punishable with imprisonment and may bring the profession into disrepute.",
      "Chen's case drew attention because of her mild role in the 2019 movement, which was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "The 2019 protests were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland for trial. The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.",
      "In response, Beijing imposed a national security law to quell the unrest. Under the law, many of the city's leading activists were prosecuted or convicted. Hong Kong government insists the law has restored the city's stability."

      "LONDON -- British officials were concerned about possible environmental damage Tuesday and looking for answers a day after a cargo ship carrying a toxic chemical hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England, setting both vessels ablaze.",
      "Jet fuel from a ruptured tank poured into the North Sea after the Portugal-registered container ship Solong broadsided the U.S-flagged tanker MV Stena Immaculate on Monday. The collision sparked explosions and fires that burned for 24 hours. Footage filmed from a helicopter on Tuesday morning showed the fire appeared to be out on the tanker, which had a large gash on its port side.",
      "British government minister Matthew Pennycook said it was a \u201cfast-moving and dynamic situation.\u201d",
      "He said air quality readings were normal and the coast guards \u201care well-equipped to contain and disperse any oil spills,\u201d with equipment including booms deployed from vessels to stop oil spreading, and aircraft that can spray dispersants on a spill.",
      "The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea.",
      "All but one of the 37 crew members from the two vessels were brought ashore in the port of Grimsby, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of London, with one hospitalized. One crew member was missing, and the coast guards suspended the search late Monday.",
      "U.K. Marine accident investigators have begun gathering evidence of what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored some 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the English coast.",
      "The investigation will be led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.",
      "The 183 meter (596 foot) Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government\u2019s Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. Its operator, U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, said it was carrying 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel in 16 tanks, at least one of which was ruptured.",
      "The company said it was unclear how much fuel had leaked into the sea.",
      "The Solong\u2019s cargo included sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water, according to industry publication Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence. It was unclear if there had been a leak.",
      "Greenpeace U.K. said it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage from the collision, which took place near busy fishing grounds and major seabird colonies.",
      "Environmentalists said oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.",
      "Tom Webb, senior lecturer in marine ecology and conservation at the University of Sheffield, said wildlife along that stretch of coast \u201cis of immense biological, cultural and economic importance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition to the wealth of marine life that is present all year round, this time of the year is crucial for many migratory species,\" he said.",
      "Alex Lukyanov, who models oil spills at the University of Reading, said the environmental impact would depend on multiple factors, including \u201cthe size of the spill, weather conditions, sea currents, water waves, wind patterns and the type of oil involved.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis particular incident is troubling because it appears to involve persistent oil, which breaks up slowly in water,\u201d he said. \u201cThe environmental toll could be severe.\u201d"

      "Kanja said the well-being of the officers was Kenya's priority and that they are \u201cwell-trained for the mission.\u201d",

      "Six weeks after Rwanda-backed rebels captured the eastern Congolese cities of Goma and Bukavu, the region is facing a setback in its fight against the mpox outbreak",
      "MITI MURHESA, Congo -- Hospitals across eastern Congo that were once at the forefront of the country\u2019s response to the mpox outbreak are facing a setback in detecting the disease and offering treatment following the advance of Rwanda-backed rebels in the region.",
      "Eastern Congo had been the epicenter of an mpox outbreak, spurred by a new form of the virus that quickly spread to African neighbors and led the World Health Organization to declare it a global health emergency.",
      "But as the M23 rebel group moved into the region's largest city of Goma on Jan. 26, in a major escalation of their yearslong fight against government forces, the conflict has hindered efforts to contain the virus and treat patients.",
      "The rebels' capture of Goma and nearby Bukavu triggered the flight of hundreds of patients from treatment centers, drugs and vaccine doses are in short supply in the absence of a humanitarian corridor to allow access for more aid, several hospitals have been destroyed while the collection and testing of medical samples have been slow, doctors and patients told The Associated Press during a recent visit to one of the mpox hot spots.",
      "\u201cThe situation has been very difficult. Insecurity has disrupted everything,\u201d said Dr. Serge Munyahu Cikuru, medical officer in charge of the Miti Murhesa health zone in South Kivu province\u2019s Kabare territory, which the M23 also controls.",
      "The country, meanwhile, continues to battle other diseases in the east, including cholera and measles, in addition to mysterious outbreaks that recently started in the northwestern region.",
      "Congo saw a 31% weekly increase in mpox cases last week, bringing the total to 16,255, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "However, that is only one side of the story: Only seven out of the 26 provinces reported cases last week, the public health agency said at its last briefing, partly blaming the security crisis.",
      "Although Congo has seen a surge in the current vaccination phase as compared to the previous one, much of that success is in other regions while eastern Congo remains cut off.",
      "The Miti Murhesa treatment center is fast running out of supplies.",
      "Mubake Buroko Patrick, an mpox patient at the facility, said it was difficult to get drugs in the weeks following the fighting.",
      "\u201cThe war has complicated our access to medicines,\u201d he said. \"I\u2019m feeling a little better, but the treatment needs to be improved.\u201d",
      "Africa CDC\u2019s mpox incident manager Dr. Ngashi Ngongo told reporters last week that authorities have started negotiations for a humanitarian corridor, which would require the suspension of hostilities to allow for humanitarian access in conflict zones.",
      "More than 600 mpox patients fled different hospitals in eastern Congo as the fighting escalated, the Africa CDC said.",
      "Many of the fleeing patients were in the Miti Murhesa health zone, one of the hardest hit in the mpox outbreak. At least 4,700 cases were reported there as of the end of 2024, according to the zone's chief medical officer Dr. Cikuru.",
      "Only two of the four treatment centers in the zone are currently functional while others are among numerous health facilities affected by the fighting between government forces and M23, he said.",
      "As M23 seized Goma and Bukavu, their fighters were expanding their presence in the region, including in other parts of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces where they had been present for years.",
      "Many patients in Miti Murhe have had to \u201cchoose between staying under fire or fleeing\u201d the rebels, Dr. Cikuru said.",
      "Tracing patients to prevent spread of mpox has become more difficult and health workers are running out of options on how to make the best of remaining medical supplies, he said.",
      "\u201cOur fear is an increase in the number of cases due to the current situation,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cPatient care in the treatment centers continues, but the shortage of medicines is a major concern.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "China, Iran and Russia have conducted joint naval drills in the Middle East",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- China, Iran and Russia conducted joint naval drills Tuesday in the Middle East, offering a show of force in a region still uneasy over Tehran's rapidly expanding nuclear program and as Yemen's Houthi rebels threaten new attacks on ships.",
      "The joint drills, called the Maritime Security Belt 2025, took place in the Gulf of Oman near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all crude oil traded worldwide passes. The area around the strait in the past has seen Iran seize commercial ships and launch suspected attacks in the time since President Donald Trump first unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The drill marked the fifth year the three countries took part in the drills.",
      "This year\u2019s drill likely sparked a warning late Monday from the British military\u2019s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which said there was GPS interference in the strait, with disruptions lasting for several hours and forcing crews to rely on backup navigation methods.",
      "\u201cThis was likely GPS jamming to reduce the targeting capability of drones and missiles,\u201d wrote Shaun Robertson, an intelligence analyst at the EOS Risk Group. \u201cHowever, electronic navigation system interference has been reported in this region previously during periods of increased tension and military exercises.\u201d",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry identified the vessels it sent to the drill as the corvettes Rezky and the Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov, as well as the tanker Pechenega. China's Defense Ministry said it sent the guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu. Neither offered a count of the personnel involved.",
      "Neither China nor Russia actively patrol the wider Middle East, whose waterways remain crucial for global energy supplies. Instead they broadly cede that to Western nations largely led by the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Observers for the drill included Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 with the Americans likely keeping watch as well.",
      "However, both China and Russia have deep interests in Iran. For China, it has continued to purchase Iranian crude oil despite facing Western sanctions, likely at a discount compared to global prices. Beijing also remains one of the top markets for Iranian imports.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has relied on Iran for the supply of bomb-carrying drones it uses in its war on Ukraine.",
      "The drills marked a major moment for Iran's state-run television network. It's aired segments showing live-fire during a night drill and sailors manning deck guns on a vessel. The exercises come after an Iranian monthslong drill that followed a direct Israeli attack on the country, targeting its air defenses and sites associated with its ballistic missile program.",
      "While Tehran sought to downplay the assault, it shook the wider populace and came as a campaign of Israeli assassinations and attacks have decimated Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d \u2014 a series of militant groups allied with the Islamic Republic. Syrian President Bashar Assad was also overthrown in December, further weakening Iran's grip on the wider region.",
      "All the while, Iran has increasingly stockpiled more uranium enriched at near weapons-grade levels, something only done by atomic-armed nations. Tehran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb.",
      "Iran's nuclear program has drawn warnings from both Israel and the U.S. that it won't allow Tehran to obtain a bomb, signalling military action against the program could happen. But just last week, Trump sent a letter to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, seeking a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Iran says it hasn't received any letter, but still issued a flurry of pronouncements over it.",
      "As a shaky ceasefire holds in Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yemen's Houthi rebels have threatened to resume their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connect the two waterways.",
      "The rebels' secretive leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid didn't resume to Gaza. That deadline came and went Tuesday. Though no attacks were reported, that again put shippers on edge. The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels in their campaign that has also killed four sailors.",

      "The students first blocked the TV building in central Belgrade, Serbia's capital, late on Monday and several hundred gathered again early on Tuesday, after announcing that their blockade will last for at least 22 hours.",
      "University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people. The protests have rocked populist rule of President Aleksandar Vucic and his firm grip on power.",
      "During the late Monday blockade, riot police briefly intervened with batons against the crowd, which tried to block one of the entrances to the TV building with metal security fences. At least one plain clothes policemen was injured in skirmishes.",
      "The students blame the public TV for bias reporting and siding with Vucic and the government during the demonstrations. The Serbian president was the guest of the main TV news bulletin on Monday evening, but its yet unclear what exactly triggered the evening protest.",
      "During the interview, Vucic insulted the student-led protests, warning that security forces will use force against participants of the big rally planned for Saturday. He pledged never to step down because of the massive nationwide demonstrations.",
      "\u201cYou will have to kill me if you want to replace me,\u201d he said,",
      "The TV reporter who interviewed Vucic called the protesting students \u201ca mob,\" which the president appeared to approve of. The station, RTS, issued a statement, denouncing the blockade.",
      "\u201cForcibly preventing RTS employees from coming to their workplaces represents a dangerous step into open conflicts with unpredictable consequences,\u201d it said.",
      "Some of the TV station's employees apparently managed to enter the building through a side entrance that's not publicly known, allowing the program to continue uninterrupted.",
      "Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell down because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. The students have insisted on full accountability in the tragedy, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions.",
      "Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia, which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.",
      "The next big rally is planned on Saturday in Belgrade and Vucic has alleged the protesters \u201cwill try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end.\u201d Many demonstrators \"will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts,\u201d he added.",
      "All student-led protests in the past months have mostly been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.",
      "Vucic and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for over a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union entry for Serbia.",
      "Authorities have indicted 16 people over the canopy collapse, but many doubt that the actual culprits will face justice."

      "This past weekend\u2019s sectarian violence was possibly among the bloodiest 72 hours in the modern history of Syria after 14 years of civil war \u2014 and it threatens to open an endless cycle of vengeance",
      "BEIRUT -- The Haydar family huddled in their apartment while gunmen stalked their hometown of Baniyas, hunting for members of Syria\u2019s minority Alawite sect like them. After 24 terrifying hours, a friend helped Samir Haydar, his wife and two sons escape \u2014 just in time.",
      "Minutes later, the gunmen, who were Sunni Muslim, broke into his building and killed the Alawites still there, Haydar said. Down the street, gunmen took Haydar\u2019s two older brothers and a nephew out of their homes and killed them, too.",
      "\u201cIf I had stayed five minutes longer, I with my entire family would have been killed,\u201d Haydar, 67, said.",
      "This past weekend\u2019s sectarian violence was possibly among the bloodiest 72 hours in the modern history of a country torn by 14 years of civil war \u2014 and it threatens to open an endless cycle of vengeance. From early Friday to Sunday night, attackers rampaged through coastal provinces heavily populated by Alawites, as well as the nearby provinces of Hama and Homs, killing people, sometimes entire families, on streets, in homes, on rooftops.",
      "Of the nearly 1,000 civilians killed, nearly 200 were in Baniyas, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor. The toll could not be independently confirmed.",
      "Among the attackers, witnesses say, were hardline Sunni Islamists, including Syria-based jihadi foreign fighters, who came from nearby provinces. Some had been allied to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the disbanded insurgent group that in December led the overthrow of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad and whose members dominate the interim government now running the country.",
      "But many were local Sunnis, unleashing hatreds pent-up over past atrocities blamed on Alawites loyal to Assad.",
      "Survivors say some of the attackers in Baniyas were Syrians from surrounding villages seeking vengeance over a 2013 massacre in the nearby town of Beyda, where paramilitaries killed several hundred Sunnis. It was one of several mass killings under then-President Assad, whose attempts to crush protests helped foment an armed insurgency.",
      "Assad, who is Alawite, filled his security agencies and paramilitaries with members of the sect. Some Sunnis blame the entire community for Assad\u2019s brutal crackdowns, though Alawites say they also suffered under his rule.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of injustices. Many were waiting for the chance to let it out,\u201d Haydar said from his hiding place after fleeing home. \u201cInstead of the pain teaching them mercy and making them against killings, they translated it into more killings.\u201d",
      "Government reinforcements \u2014 which residents said did not intervene during the height of the killings \u2014 were eventually sent to restore order, and calm appeared to hold by late Monday. The government declared an independent committee appointed by the president will investigate the attacks. But the bloodshed has deeply tainted attempts by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa to convince Syria\u2019s minorities that he wants to include them as equals.",
      "The bloodshed began after reports Thursday night of seemingly coordinated attacks by Assad loyalists on government security forces near the city of Latakia and elsewhere along the coast.",
      "The Associated Press spoke to nine residents from villages and towns hit by the violence. Some refused to give their names out of fear for their security.",
      "Haydar said that around daybreak Friday, hordes of armed Sunnis descended on Baniyas and surrounding villages in vans and pickup trucks, and waving guns. Another resident said she heard the gunmen shouting, \u201cGod is great,\u201d and threatening and cursing the Alawite residents.",
      "Images and videos soon surfaced online, mostly posted by the perpetrators. Some show fighters in military fatigues pushing residents out of homes into the streets, beating some with rifles and forcing them to bark like dogs, in humiliation. Some show fighters firing on civilians. The hundreds of videos posted could not be immediately verified.",
      "Looting and theft were rampant. Haydar said armed men went into the building of one of his elder brothers, 74-year-old Rafik, stole his valuables and left.",
      "Hiding in his home, Haydar said he saw fighters shoot a neighbor at the entrance of a nearby building. One fighter turned the body over to ensure he was dead.",
      "Around noon Friday, Haydar got a call from the wife of his other brother, Iskander. She screamed that fighters had stormed their building and taken away Iskander and their son, Mourad.",
      "Later, Mourad told his mother what happened. The fighters dragged them to the roof and made him, his father and five other men lie down. Then they sprayed them with bullets. Miraculously, Mourad was uninjured. His father and the rest of the men were killed.",
      "Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of the same neighborhood, said five of his neighbors were shot in the street, including two doctors and their two children. The gunmen prevented anyone from coming to remove their bodies for hours. Acting fast, Sheha secured a van. He, his wife, three children and other families squeezed in and fled.",
      "That night, the village where they took refuge also came under attack. Sheha said he and hundreds of others fled again, sleeping for two nights outside among olive and pine trees.",
      "By Saturday afternoon, Sheha said he knew of at least 20 people killed, including three cousins and two of their children with special needs, gunned down in their food stall.",
      "When fighters entered his nephew\u2019s house, they asked if his wife was Sunni, because she wore a headscarf. They checked her ID and let her go. His sister, living in a building with many Christians, said the gunmen spared them and her husband, in his 80s.",
      "Haydar and his family escaped with help from a Sunni friend who negotiated for hours with the gunmen, explaining that Haydar had once been imprisoned by Assad\u2019s security forces.",
      "The friend, declining to give his name for fear of retribution, said that at one point, the gunmen shoved and hit him, criticizing him for harboring Alawites.",
      "During the weekend\u2019s violence, the friend sheltered 15 Alawites in his home, he said by phone from Baniyas.",
      "In Tuwaym, an Alawite village in the Sunni-majority Hama province in central Syria, a resident said gunmen summoned the men, beat them with rifles and shot some. By the time they left, they had killed 25 members of her family, including her father and nine children between the ages of four and 15.",
      "\u201cI carried the children with my own hands. Some had their bones coming out of the gaping wounds,\u201d she said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear for her safety.",
      "In Baniyas and elsewhere, bodies were left lying in streets, cars and apartment buildings, civil rescue teams said. Sheha and other residents began documenting those killed. Lists of names and recorded testimonies of terrified residents surfaced online. Haydar buried his brothers Sunday.",
      "Sheha was part of a group of Alawite civilians that sought to build bridges with the new government.",
      "He said the Alawites can\u2019t be blamed for the crimes of Assad\u2019s forces. Most Alawites were impoverished under Assad, abused by his top aides and forced to show loyalty and serve in the army, he said.",
      "Instead of seeing inclusion and transitional justice, the community is targeted in revenge, he said. In a national dialogue convened this month by al-Sharaa, only a few Alawites were included in the 600-member conference, he said.",
      "\u201cRecovery from this won\u2019t be easy,\u201d he said.",

      "Hungary\u2019s government is limiting the profit margin for grocers on a number of basic food items in response to growing inflation hitting consumers in the Central European country",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary's government will limit the profit margin for grocers on a number of basic food items, the prime minister said on Tuesday, a response to growing inflation hitting consumers in the Central European country.",
      "Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said in a video on social media that commercial grocers must limit their markup to no more than 10% of wholesale price on 30 different food items, a policy that would be in effect from mid-March until the end of May, but could be extended.",
      "He said that the government would monitor grocers' compliance with the policy, but didn't specify which foods would be included in the requirement.",
      "\"In order to curb excessive and unjustified price increases, we have been negotiating with representatives of commercial chains in recent days,\" Orb\u00e1n said. \u201cUnfortunately, the vendors' offers fell far short of our expectations.\u201d",
      "Inflation data released Tuesday by Hungary's statistical office showed an annual inflation rate of 5.6% for February, while food prices were up 7.1% on the year. By contrast, average inflation in the 20-member eurozone was 2.4% in February, according to the European Union's statistical office Eurostat.",
      "Hungary, which isn\u2019t a member of the eurozone, uses the forint as its national currency.",
      "The data came as an \u201cunpleasant inflation surprise\" for Hungary, which \u201cindicates increasing price pressure in the Hungarian economy with regard to more permanent inflationary trends,\u201d Orsolya Nyeste, a macroeconomic analyst with Erste Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday.",
      "Hungary has frequently led the EU in inflation in recent years as a cost of living crisis has gripped the country. The populist government has pointed to external factors such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia to explain the yearslong inflation spiral, though prices in other regional countries like Poland, Romania and Slovakia haven't risen nearly as steeply.",
      "Extreme jumps in food prices \u2014 peaking at more than 45% at the beginning of 2023 \u2014 have spurred previous government interventions in Hungary that included price caps on a number of food items as well as fuel at filling stations. But some critics and economists argued that sellers simply raised prices on other products to make up for shortfalls caused by the price controls.",
      "The inflation numbers present a challenge for Orb\u00e1n as Hungary's economy continues to struggle before a national election in 2026. The EU's longest-serving leader, in power since 2010, faces a challenge from a new party that has placed the stagnating economy and cost of living issues at the center of its political platform.",
      "Compounding Hungary's difficulties, the EU has withheld billions in funding from Budapest because of concerns over judicial independence and rule-of-law standards."

      "In northeast Syria, revelers took to the streets after the announcement of a breakthrough deal between the central government in Damascus and local Kurdish-led authorities",
      "QAMISHLI, Syria -- In the city of Qamishli in northeast Syria, revelers took to the streets after the announcement of a breakthrough deal between the central government in Damascus and local Kurdish-led authorities, dancing and chanting \u201cOne, one, one \u2014 the Syrian people are one,\u201d as cars drove by honking in celebration.",
      "The scenes of elation following Monday night's declaration came in sharp contrast to the grim scenes in coastal communities wracked by days of clashes that broke out last week between government forces and armed groups affiliated with deposed President Bashar Assad.",
      "Monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed in revenge attacks, primarily targeting members of the Alawite religious minority to which Assad belongs.",
      "Some families took refuge in a Russian air base in the coastal province of Latakia as thousands more fled to neighboring Lebanon, mostly through irregular border crossings in the country's north. The U.N. refugee agency reported at least 7,616 people had fled to northern Lebanon where humanitarian organizations were handing out food and blankets.",
      "Lebanon is hosting more than 755,000 registered Syrian refugees, with hundreds of thousands more believed to be unregistered. Since the fall of Assad, the flow had begun to reverse, with the U.N. reporting that nearly 260,000 Syrian refugees have returned home since November, about half of them coming from Lebanon.",
      "But the outbreak of violence last week has threatened to reverse that flow.",
      "While a tense calm prevailed over most of the Syrian coast Tuesday, families were still wading across a river marking the border between Syria and northern Lebanon's Akkar province, some carrying children on their backs.",
      "Radwan Alo fled his home in the countryside outside Qardaha, the hometown of the Assad family, and crossed the river into Lebanon. Alo said his twin uncles were killed by armed men, who he believes aimed at \u201ca complete extermination of the Alawite sect.\u201d He has been unable to reach his wife and children who stayed behind to find out if they are safe.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office has documented the killing of 111 civilians so far, saying in a statement Tuesday, \u201cthe process of verification is ongoing, and the actual number of people killed is believed to be significantly higher.\u201d The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, has reported nearly 1,000 civilians killed. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the figure.",
      "Syrian authorities have formed a committee tasked with investigating the attacks on civilians and in recent days announced a series of arrests of people who allegedly took part in the massacres.",
      "At a press conference Tuesday, Yasser Al-Farhan, spokesman for the committee, promised that \u201cno one is above the law\u201d and said that the panel will present its findings to the president's office and the judiciary. He said the committee will set up a witness protection program for those who come forward to report crimes.",
      "Meanwhile, Kurds in northeast Syria were hopeful that the agreement announced Monday, which includes a ceasefire and the merging of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces into the Syrian army, would end years of fighting between Kurdish forces and Turkish-backed groups in northern Syria and allow displaced people to return home.",
      "While the details of its implementation remain to be worked out, the deal signaled a step toward stabilizing Syria and consolidating control of the country under a single central authority in Damascus.",
      "Malak Ibrahim, a Kurdish man who was displaced to Qamishli from the town of Afrin eight years earlier when Turkish-backed forces seized control of his area, said he is now hopeful that \u201cthe injustice will end, so we all can go back to our homes.\u201d The agreement inked Monday promises to protect the rights of the Kurds.",
      "Arab residents of the area also said they hope the deal will bring an end to years of conflict.",
      "\u201cWe want to end the bloodshed,\" said Majdal Hamza, an Arab from Qamishli countryside: \"We are all brothers in one country.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014-",

      "Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been arrested by police at Manila\u2019s international airport on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's international airport Tuesday on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.",
      "Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the massive killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement.",
      "The Manila office of the International Police received an official copy of the arrest warrant from the global court and the notice for an arrest warrant was served to the former president, the government said.",
      "It was not immediately clear where Duterte was taken by the police. The government said the 79-year-old former leader was in good health and was examined by government doctors.",
      "\u201cHe's now in the custody of authorities,\u201d the government said.",
      "The ICC began investigating drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court\u2019s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration\u2019s objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.",

      "Last week a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, was shot at. Earlier in the week, after the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir, government troops surrounded Machar\u2019s home in Juba and several of his allies were arrested.

      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the 5-year civil war that followed.",
      "With the support of regional leaders and the international community, Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in 2018 and Machar returned to Juba as South Sudan's first vice president.",
      "But the political rivalry between South Sudan's top two leaders \u2014 with Kiir suspicious of his deputy\u2019s ambitions and Machar calling Kiir a dictator \u2014 remains an obstacle to lasting peace. Both men have been accused of violating multiple ceasefires.",
      "Kiir and Machar are under pressure from the U.S. and others to more quickly implement the 2018 peace deal and prepare for elections.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine has key questions it wants answered as army chiefs from over 30 countries arrive Tuesday in Paris for talks on creating an international force to deter future Russian aggression once a ceasefire is established. They include troop size, location and, crucially, military options in the event of a transgression.",
      "The Paris meeting is the most significant culmination so far of French and British efforts to rally nations under a so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to safeguard Ukraine by establishing a reassurance and deterrence force to dissuade Russia from invading again.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, who is to attend the meeting, said it would be held in \u201cclose coordination\u201d with the NATO alliance.",
      "The talks will include nearly all 32 NATO countries \u2014 notably without the United States \u2014 as well as Commonwealth nations and Asian powers Japan and South Korea, said a French military official. Participants will be invited to spell out what their militaries might be able and willing to contribute, be that troops, weapons or other assistance.",
      "French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said \u201cthis meeting is important because it lays the ground for these security guarantees\u201d and how \u201cEuropean armed forces can gain credit and credibility for diplomatic talks which will, unquestionably, extend over the long term.\u201d",
      "Some Ukrainian officials are wary of any deal without clearly identified security guarantees. For them, a key question is how such a coalition will respond if Russia violates any future ceasefire agreement. What kind of military response would follow a large-scale offensive by Russia and how quickly will that response materialize?",
      "Western and Ukrainian officials said that, while there is plenty of thinking and resolve, there is no definitive plan for military options yet. First, they must assess what willing countries might be able to offer. The Associated Press spoke to Western and Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, as well as French officials in Paris and British officials in London. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to speak openly about sensitive matters.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the proposal but expressed skepticism, telling The AP in an interview in February that foreign troops alone would not be a sufficient guarantee of security for his country, and that such a plan should be backed up by weapons from the U.S. and Europe, and support for Kyiv to develop its own defense industry.",
      "\u201cDiplomats are discussing, military officials are discussing, but we still don\u2019t have real proposals,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian official about the plan. The talks \u201care not in the first stage, we did a lot in the first stage, but we still don\u2019t have a real solid approach.\u201d",
      "As President Donald Trump has appeared to nix the idea of U.S. security guarantees and other U.S. officials said this will fall on Europe to enforce, the French-British plan looks to create a force equipped with enough military might to dissuade Russia from attacking Ukraine again. \u201cThat is the crux of it,\u201d said a Western official in Kyiv.",
      "The force being envisaged by France and Britain would aim to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any ceasefire, a French military official told AP. It could include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine\u2019s defense in the event of a Russian attack that shatters any truce, the official said.",
      "The Western official in Kyiv, offering another idea on the table, said they could incorporate direct and immediate strikes on Russian assets in the event of a violation.",
      "Details of the contours of the proposal have emerged piecemeal in recent weeks as technical discussions have been ongoing between Western diplomatic and military officials in Ukraine and other European capitals.",
      "Political leaders have convened key summits in the past two months to establish common ground. It was discussed at a summit of more than a dozen mostly European leaders in London on March 2, and at a virtual planning meeting on March 5 called by the U.K. and attended by officials from about 20 countries.",
      "France and Britain are now casting the net even wider in their search for nations willing to back the blueprint and provide the force with teeth. The Paris talks on Tuesday will include not just NATO and European Union nations but also Asian and Oceania countries. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea will dial into the discussions remotely, the French military official said. Turkey, which has the largest army in NATO and a robust defense industry and shared stakes in the Black Sea, will attend. NATO nation Canada will also be represented.",
      "The United States \u2014 NATO\u2019s most militarily powerful member \u2014 was not invited because European nations want to show that they are able to shoulder a large part of the job of safeguarding Ukraine once a truce is in effect, the French military official said.",
      "Last month, some Western officials described a small Europe-dominated \u201creassurance force\u201d of less than 30,000 troops, rather than an ambitious army of peacekeepers posted along the 600-mile (1,000 kilometer) front line.",
      "But other officials have said the numbers were under discussion. According to one version of the proposal, troops would be posted away from the front line at key infrastructure sites such as nuclear power plants and backed by Western air and sea power. The front line would largely be monitored remotely, with drones and other technology. Air power, including U.S. air power based outside Ukraine, perhaps in Poland or Romania, would be in reserve to deter breaches and reopen Ukrainian airspace to commercial flights.",
      "Allied navies could also play a role in the Black Sea clearing mines and patrolling to keep international waters safe.",
      "The idea is to \u201caggregate\u201d the capabilities those countries are ready to provide in order to be able to offer security guarantees to make sure the peace deal is \u201crobust and verifiable,\u201d with the aim to get some U.S. backstop, another French official said.",
      "\u201cTo get signals on the U.S. backstop, the \u2018able and willing\u2019 European countries must be able to aggregate their capabilities and demands,\u201d he said.",
      "Some Western officials cautioned that there will be several stages to a peace plan and a broader range of countries could join the coalition later on. The first step could be a one-month freeze, as proposed by Zelenskyy and European leaders, as a confidence building measure.",
      "The Ukrainian officials said they were optimistic about the coalition of the willing, conceding they have few other options with NATO off the table.",
      "\u201cI fully believe it\u2019s very possible,\u201d said one senior Ukrainian official. \u201cTrump is comfortable with the idea, the idea is very positive for us, and if Europe wants to be a real player, they should do this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they lose this opportunity, we will be in a very difficult situation,\u201d he added.",

      "Newspaper Aargauer Zeitung on Friday reported that Marc Jaisli \u2014 a member of the local council in Buchs, a town west of Zurich \u2014 ordered the water pistols in August through ultra low-cost online retailer Temu for his godchildren as a gift.",
      "Prosecutors ordered him to pay a fine totaling 6,500 francs ($7,390) for a violation of weapons law, arguing that it applied even though the pistols were imitations \u201cbecause they could be confused for real firearms due to their appearance\u201d \u2014 despite the pink color.",
      "Aargauer Zeitung reported that Jaisli said he had not been aware of the violation, but accepted the penalty and paid the fine."

      "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- High-stakes talks between senior delegations from Ukraine and the United States on how to end Kyiv\u2019s three-year war with Moscow opened in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, hours after Russian air defenses shot down 337 Ukrainian drones over 10 regions in Russia.",
      "Two people were killed and 18 were injured in the massive drone attack, including three children, officials said. No large-scale damage was reported.",
      "In the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, journalists briefly entered a room where senior Ukrainian delegation met with America\u2019s top diplomat for talks on ending Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio smiled for the cameras, while Ukrainian officials sat without expression at a table across from them as the meeting got underway at a luxury hotel. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian or U.S. officials on the drone attack.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister was on hand for the talks as American, Saudi and Ukrainian flags stood in the background. Officials answered no shouted questions.",
      "The talks reflect a new diplomatic push after an unprecedented argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Feb. 28 visit to the White House. Ukrainian officials told The Associated Press on Monday that they will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea, which would bring safer shipping, as well long-range missile strikes that have hit civilians in Ukraine, and the release of prisoners.",
      "The Kremlin has not publicly offered any concessions. Russia has said it\u2019s ready to cease hostilities on condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian.",
      "Russian forces have held the battlefield momentum for more than a year and are pushing at selected points along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region.",
      "Most of the Ukrainian drones fired overnight \u2014 126 of them \u2014 were shot down over the Kursk region across the border from Ukraine, parts of which Kyiv\u2019s forces control, and 91 were shot down over the Moscow region, according to a statement by Russia's Defense Ministry.",
      "Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said over 70 drones targeted the Russian capital and were shot down as they were flying toward it \u2014 the biggest single attack on Moscow so far in the war.",
      "Other attacked regions listed in the statement included Belgorod, Bryansk and Voronezh on the border with Ukraine and those deeper inside Russia, such as Kaluga, Lipetsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Oryol and Ryazan.",
      "The governor of the Moscow region surrounding the capital, Andrei Vorobyov, said the attack damaged several residential buildings and a number of cars.",
      "Another person was wounded on a highway in the Lipetsk region, Gov. Igor Artamonov said.",
      "Sobyanin said the roof of a building in Moscow also sustained damage, which he described as \u201cinsignificant.\u201d Footage of the building, published by RIA Novosti, showed a charred spot on the facade of a multi-story residential building near the roof, with bits of the building's lining stripped off.",
      "Flights were temporarily restricted in and out of six airports, including Domodedovo, Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky just outside Moscow, and airports in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions.",
      "Train traffic through the Domodedovo railway station in the Moscow region has also been briefly halted, local officials reported.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do,\u201d Rubio told reporters accompanying him. \u201cI think we want to listen to see how far they\u2019re willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.\u201d",
      "Rubio said the rare earths and critical minerals deal could be signed during the meeting but stressed it was not a precondition for the United States to move ahead with discussions with either Ukraine or the Russians.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis has written and spoken at length about sickness, aging and death",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis has written and spoken at length about sickness, aging and death, and personally directed that his doctors provide the fairly detailed daily updates that have punctuated his own battle with pneumonia.",
      "On Monday, they reported good news: Francis was no longer in imminent danger of death but needed to remain hospitalized for several more days to receive treatment.",
      "The 88-year-old pope is merely responding to the sometimes morbid interest in the health of popes over centuries, and is making his own the somewhat-mixed legacy of St. John Paul II. The Polish pope suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease, and his decline was on public view for years. But the Vatican never admitted he had the disease until after he was dead.",
      "Francis\u2019 candor with his own fragility is very much in keeping with a decision he made early on in his papacy to be up front about his health: He granted an unprecedented tell-all interview to an Argentine doctor who published a book in 2021 detailing Francis\u2019 physical and mental health history. And last week, Francis recorded an audio message from the hospital that laid bare the weakness of his voice, and the labored, breathless effort it took for him to utter just a few words.",
      "Here are a few of Francis\u2019 past musings on sickness, ageing and death and how they might affect the future of his pontificate.",
      "Francis has long complained about the way society treats old people, saying they are part of today\u2019s consumerist \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d when they are deemed no longer productive. For that reason especially, he insisted that Pope Benedict XVI continue to be part of the life of the church during his 10-year retirement.",
      "Francis\u2019 views on ageing have been consistent, even as he himself has aged and become dependent on a wheelchair and walker to get around.",
      "In the 2010 book \u201cOn Heaven and Earth,\u201d written alongside his friend the Argentine Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Francis denounced the cruelty that confronts elderly people. He shamed families who shut their grandparents away in nursing homes and neglect to visit them.",
      "\u201cThe elderly are sources of the transmission of history, the people who give us memories, they are the memory of the people, of a nation, of the family and of the culture, religion,\u201d said Francis, who at the time was the archbishop of Buenos Aires.",
      "In the same book, then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio recalled that his grandmother Rosa, who helped raise him, had the words of an adage framed on her bedside table that stayed with him all his life: \u201cSee that God sees you, see that he is watching you, see that you will die and you don\u2019t know when.\u201d",
      "He referred to the saying again in 2018 in a speech to priests, and that his grandmother had instructed him to recite it every day \u201c\u2018so you will remember that life has an end.\u2019\"",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t understand much at the time, but that verse, since I was three years old, has stuck with me,\u201d he told the priests. \u201cAnd it helped me. The thing was kind of bleak, but it helped me.\u201d",
      "The Argentine journalist and physician, Dr. Nelson Castro, revealed in his 2021 book \u201cThe Health of Popes,\u201d that Francis had reached out to him within a few months of his 2013 election with a suggestion that he write a book about the history of the health of the popes, including his own.",
      "Castro was granted access to the Vatican Secret Archives to research the lives and deaths of past popes and had a sit-down interview with Francis on Feb. 19, 2019, during which the reigning pope spoke at length and in detail about his various ailments over the years: The respiratory infection that resulted in the removal of the upper lobe of his right lung, the gangrenous gallbladder he had removed when he was provincial superior of the Jesuits, the compressed vertebrae, flat feet and fatty liver he has lived with.",
      "The most noteworthy revelation was that Francis said he saw a psychiatrist weekly during six months of Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship. He had sought out help to manage his anxiety when he was trying to hide people from the military and ferry them out of Argentina.",
      "\u201cIn those six months she helped me with respect to how to manage the fears of that time,\u201d he told Castro. \u201cIf you can imagine what it was like to transport someone hidden in the car \u2014 covered by a blanket \u2014 and pass through military controls. \u2026 It created an enormous tension in me.\u201d",
      "He said the therapy also helped him to maintain a sense of equilibrium in making decisions of all kinds, and that in general he believes all priests must understand human psychology.",
      "\u201cWe should offer a mate to our neuroses,\u201d he said, referring to the South American tea. \u201cThey are our companions for life.\u201d",
      "As early as 2014 Francis was already assuming his papacy would be short-lived and that his own death was not far off.",
      "\u201cI realize that this is not going to last long, two or three years, and then \u2026 off to the house of the Father,\u201d he told reporters in 2014 while traveling home from one of his early foreign trips, to South Korea.",
      "He told Castro later that he thought about death \u2014 a lot \u2014 but that it didn\u2019t scare him \u201cone bit.\u201d",
      "Francis made plans, too: He decided his tomb will be in St. Mary Major basilica, not in the Vatican, so he can be near his favorite icon of the Madonna, the Salus Populi Romani (\"Salvation of the People of Rome\"), which is located there.",
      "More recently, he has taken to speaking about upcoming events that he is pretty sure he won\u2019t be around for, and indicating who might.",
      "In 2023, speaking to reporters about the Vatican\u2019s warming relations with Vietnam, Francis concurred that the country warranted a papal visit.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t go, surely John XXIV will,\u201d he said chuckling, referring to a future pope who might be named for the progressive, Vatican II-era pontiff, John XXIII.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.",
      "A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.",
      "Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.",
      "\u201cIt has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.",
      "\u201cMalcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, who left a savage legacy over his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, was arrested on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity for the thousands killed in a war he waged against drugs in a political career spanning decades. His detention capped an international investigation into killings, which unfolded for more than a dozen years..",
      "Duterte again came under the spotlight during a weekend trip to Hong Kong when the trip sparked speculation that he may have gone into exile while on a trip to Hong Kong to evade a looming international arrest warrant. He had appeared as the main speaker on Sunday at a gathering of thousands of cheering and flag-waving Filipino expatriates, who jammed Southorn Stadium in downtown Wan Chai district.",
      "Now 79 and in poor health, Duterte campaigned for his political party\u2019s senatorial candidates ahead of the May 12 mid-term elections in the Philippines. He said he was aware the International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for his arrest over his campaign against illegal drugs that left thousands of suspects dead.",
      "He again tried to justify the brutal crackdown and the crowd cheered him on. Police arrested him as he got off the plane at Manilla International Airport based on an ICC warrant.",
      "Here\u2019s more about Duterte, his ICC case and what lies ahead for one of Asia\u2019s most unorthodox leaders in his time:",
      "Duterte, a former prosecutor, congressman and longtime mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao, built a political name with his expletive-laced outbursts against the elites, the dominant Roman Catholic church and the West. He was also seen as pro-poor and a populist, but he is perhaps best remembered for his brutal approach to criminality, particularly illegal drugs.",
      "Under his police-enforced crackdown in Davao at the start of the millennium, an estimated 1,000 mostly poor suspects were gunned down extrajudicially. One police officer involved in the Davao killings who later defected from Duterte told The Associated Press that up to 10,000 suspects were killed by his and other police and civilian hit squads under Duterte.",
      "The death toll in the crackdown was alarmingly high for years, gaining Duterte nicknames like \u201cthe Punisher\u201d and \u201cDuterte Harry,\u201d after the Western movie police character with little regard for the law.",
      "Human rights activists said people were afraid to testify against Duterte in court.",
      "In 2016, Duterte won the presidency on an audacious but failed promise to eradicate illegal drugs and corruption within three to six months, in a country long weary of crime and corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cAll of you who are into drugs, you sons of bitches, I will really kill you,\u201d Duterte told a huge crowd in a 2016 campaign stop in Manila. \u201cI have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.\u201d",
      "The United States, the European Union and other Western governments raised alarms over the anti-drugs campaign, prompting Duterte in 2016 to tell then-President Barack Obama \u201cyou can go to hell\u201d as he threatened to \u201cbreak up with America.\u201d",
      "The ICC launched an investigation into drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability over the killings.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court\u2019s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in July 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration\u2019s objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.",
      "China, which controls Hong Kong, and the Philippines do not currently belong to the ICC, but both are members of Interpol. The global court may issue a warrant for Duterte\u2019s arrest through Interpol.",
      "A prominent Philippine politician closely involved in the ICC cases against Duterte told the AP over the weekend the global court had issued a warrant for Duterte's arrest through Interpol. The politician spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive issue publicly.",
      "Neither the ICC nor Interpol have yet confirmed the issuance of an arrest warrant.",
      "In his rambling speech on Sunday before mostly Filipino workers in Hong Kong, Duterte again justified his deadly anti-drugs campaign, saying it safeguarded Filipino people.",
      "Duterte has denied authorizing extrajudicial killings, but he openly and repeatedly threatened to kill suspected drug dealers when he was in office.",
      "\u201cWhat was my sin?\u201d Duterte asked in Hong Kong. \u201cI did everything in my time so Filipinos can have a little peace and tranquility.\u201d",
      "He said he was prepared to go to jail but told the crowd in jest to make donations for the construction of a monument of him \u2014 which he suggested with a gesture of his hand should show him holding a gun.",
      "Duterte had said he retired from politics after his stormy presidential term ended in 2022. But in another turnaround from his earlier remarks, he registered to run for mayor of Davao with one of his sons running with him for vice mayor in elections in May.",
      "In Davao, additional police forces were deployed at the international airport and extra checkpoints were set up in what authorities said were meant to be prepared for any contingency ahead of the mid-term elections. The forces in Davao and elsewhere could step in if Duterte\u2019s arrest were to ignite unrest, which the Marcos administration said it could deftly handle."

The move drew intense international criticism as even before the war the over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza relied on international aid, something that's only intensified after a grinding Israeli military offensive destroyed the enclave.",

      "The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation."

      "The entities include West Indies Oil Company Ltd., an Antigua-based petroleum storage and distribution company of which the government is a majority shareholder, and Fancy Bridge Ltd., a Hong Kong-based investment firm that owns shares in the oil company, as does Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., known as PDVSA.",
      "Alfa Nero was anchored off Antigua when the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.",

Days before the report was published, the prime minister had said his administration was considering using the money to build a resort.",

      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",

      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate its businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled Japan for Lebanon.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Nishida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",

      "The economy has already shown some signs of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking.",

      "Musk has long wanted Starlink to enter the world\u2019s most populous market, but its entry into India has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Airtel \u2014 India\u2019s second largest telecom operator \u2014 said in a statement that its deal with Starlink depends on whether the subsidiary of U.S. aerospace company SpaceX can receive government approval to begin operating in India.",
      "At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet and cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband, including to areas where internet previously has been completely unavailable.",
      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink had yet to comply with security norms, and that a license for satellite communications services would be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "The announcement about the Airtel partnership comes weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Musk in Washington where they discussed issues including space, mobility, technology and innovation.",
      "The deal will \u201cexplore how Starlink can complement and expand Airtel\u2019s offerings, and how Airtel\u2019s expertise in the Indian market complements SpaceX\u2019s direct offerings to consumers and businesses,\u201d the company's statement said.",
      "As part of the agreement, the two companies will explore offering Starlink equipment at Airtel\u2019s vast retail store network, Starlink services through Airtel to business customers, and using each other\u2019s network infrastructure to enhance coverage across India.",
      "The statement did not provide further details."

      "BEIJING -- China wrapped up its biggest political event of the year on Tuesday leaving one question unanswered: How far will it go to try to revive economic growth in 2025?",
      "A recurring theme throughout the weeklong meeting of the nearly 3,000-member National People\u2019s Congress was the need to boost investment and consumer spending.",
      "How much will be done to translate words into action will only become clear in the months ahead as the ruling Communist Party juggles priorities. What is clear is that a burgeoning trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain.",
      "The meeting ended in the absence of top political leader Zhao Leji, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Congress. Zhao, who was supposed to host the closing session, had a respiratory tract infection, said Vice Chairman Li Hongzhong, who chaired the meeting in his place.",
      "The rubber-stamp parliament voted overwhelmingly to approve an annual government work report, with 2,882 votes for, one vote against and one abstention. Similar near-unanimous votes were recorded to pass the budget and an amendment to a law on deputies to the Congress, among other items.",
      "At stake is the health of the world's second largest economy, a major exporter of products to countries around the world and an important market for foreign companies from Apple to Volkswagen. A prolonged property crisis has sapped consumer and business confidence, depriving the economy of its past vitality. Now, a tariff war unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump is compounding those problems.",
      "The Congress opened with the announcement of an economic growth target of \"about 5%\u201d for this year, a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve with the measures detailed during this year's Congress.",
      "They include borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade-in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt.",
      "\u201cIt is unclear how much of a jolt this budget will provide to underlying domestic demand and reflation efforts, despite the sizeable rise in the deficit,\u201d Jeremy Zook, the lead China analyst for Fitch Ratings, said in a report.",
      "The ambitious 5% growth target signaled to analysts that more stimulus may be coming. Last year, the government surprised stock markets with various moves beginning in September to push growth up to 5%, also the target in 2024.",
      "Finance Minister Lan Fo\u2019an told journalists covering the Congress that the government had sufficient tools in reserve to deal with external or domestic uncertainties.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping seems bent on reinvigorating private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country's state-dominated economy. Years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors.",
      "The Congress reviewed comments on a proposed law meant to improve the environment for private enterprises by regulating aspects of market access, financing, competition and property rights protection, among others. The legislation was not put to a vote.",
      "Xi aims to send a \u201cmessage to entrepreneurs, but also to local governments and regulators, that the private sector\u2019s important and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said ahead of the congress.",
      "Private companies will also gain access to a higher share of loans than before, and financing for private businesses raised through bond issuance will be expanded, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said in the work report.",
      "Much rides on how far Trump pursues his trade wars with China and other countries.",
      "China has diversified its export markets in recent years, but the U.S. remains a vital trading partner. The greater fear is not the tariffs themselves but the health of the U.S. economy and demand for Chinese products, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief Asia-Pacific economist for Natixis investment bank.",
      "Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January. China has shown no sign of backing down.",
      "\u201cIf the American side goes further down this wrong path, we will fight to the end,\u201d Commerce Minister Wang Wentao told journalists during the Congress.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the law of the jungle would reign if all countries adopted a \u201cmy country first\u201d approach.",

      "The government said in its annual report that it would address what it considers unproductive \u201crat-race\u201d competition, invoking a term that was a buzzword in China five years ago among stressed-out younger workers.",
      "The government is applying the term \u201cneijuan\u201d \u2014 more commonly translated as \u201cinvolution\u201d \u2014 to companies and local governments rather than workers. A proliferation of green energy firms, for example, has led to gluts in solar panels and other equipment and fierce price wars that ultimately harm the industry.",
      "\u201cTheir strategies are similar, which leads to extremely cruel competition,\u201d Chinese tech leader Lei Jun, the CEO of Xiaomi and a delegate to the Congress, told state media.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum are unjustified, but his government will not retaliate with its own tariffs",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum were unjustified, but his government would not retaliate with its own tariffs.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.",
      "A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.",
      "Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.",
      "\u201cIt has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.",
      "\u201cMalcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

    "story": [
      "A U.S. corruption case involving Indian energy tycoon Gautam Adani has exposed vulnerabilities in India's solar sector that are hindering its capacity to switch to clean energy and help limit climate change",
      "BENGALURU, India -- President Donald Trump's decision to freeze a law banning business bribes overseas could offer Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, one of Asia's richest people, a reprieve from American corruption allegations linked to a major solar project in India.",
      "U.S. prosecutors allege that one of Adani's companies duped investors by hiding that its project was backed by a $265 million bribery scheme. The case now may be reviewed, and enforcement of any potential decision against it is uncertain. Whatever its fate, the case has highlighted vulnerabilities in India\u2019s solar sector that are hindering its capacity to switch to clean energy, help limit climate change and cut heavy pollution in many of its cities.",
      "The Adani Group, whose business interests span much of the economy from ports and airports to energy and media, has denied the U.S. allegations. It declined requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump suspended the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, raising expectations among some in India that the allegations against Adani might be put on ice. Shares in Adani\u2019s companies surged but then fell just days later when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sought help from Indian authorities in serving its complaint against Adani.",
      "The allegations have had wider repercussions outside India. Adani Green Energy has withdrawn its wind energy projects from Sri Lanka after the island nation sought to renegotiate prices. Kenya canceled energy and airport expansion deals with the company, while investor TotalEnergies, a French oil giant, has paused new investments.",
      "Adani Green Energy, or AGEL, is India\u2019s largest renewable energy company. It is building one of the world\u2019s largest clean power projects in salt deserts bordering Pakistan in the Western Indian state of Gujarat. Once completed, they would produce 30 gigawatts of clean power, enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.",
      "AGEL has projects in 12 Indian states, with 11.6 gigawatts of clean power capacity. It aims to generate 50 gigawatts of renewable power by 2030, a tenth of India\u2019s clean energy goal for the same time period.",
      "In November, Adani said his company would invest $35 billion over five years in large-scale solar, wind, and hybrid power plants across India. It is also one of the country's few large-scale producers of solar and wind power components. But the industry itself is struggling.",
      "India's state-owned electricity companies are chronically short on cash. By 2022-23 their losses totaled $7.8 billion \u2014 2.4% of India\u2019s GDP, according to government data. Operations are plagued by bad planning, fears of public anger over higher electricity rates and large electricity losses during transmission.",
      "\u201cWaiving the costs upfront makes it cheap for those building power plants, but ultimately the system has to bear that cost,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi.",
      "Accommodating inevitable fluctuations in solar and wind power is also costly, said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. That means keeping expensive coal power on standby.",
      "Renewable energy is cheaper than coal in India, but utilities still view clean power as just a \u201cstatutory obligation,\u201d said Alexander Hogeveen Rutter, an energy analyst in Bengaluru.",
      "To troubleshoot state utilities' financial woes, the federal government agency established the Solar Energy Corporation of India, or SECI, to help manage risks.",
      "SECI awarded a contract of 12 gigawatts of solar energy to the Adani Group and another New York Stock Exchange-listed company, Azure Power, at a specific price. The U.S. indictment alleges that state utilities balked at buying power at that rate and that the bribery was aimed at getting them to sign on.",
      "Azure Power said in a statement in November that it was cooperating with American agencies and that it had ceased to employ the people mentioned in the indictment. SECI didn't respond to queries from The Associated Press.",
      "SECI doesn\u2019t buy clean power but facilitates sales to Indian states. That cuts risks of power developers going unpaid but it has raised administrative costs, Rutter said. \"This whole scheme, which was supposed to drive down costs is actually driving up costs,\u201d he said.",
      "India restricts imports of cheap Chinese solar modules and is subsidizing local manufacturers. That helped raise domestic production by six-fold in 2021-2023, according to the Press Trust of India, though Indian-made solar components are more expensive than Chinese one.",
      "But India lags behind countries like Brazil and Australia in rooftop solar, having installed only 11 gigawatts so far -\u2013 far less than the 40 gigawatts it aimed to have by 2022. Policies favoring large installations have constrained growth of solar, which mainly comes from football-field-sized farms, Rutter said.",
      "Many large renewable energy companies, like Adani's, manufacture parts like solar panels and cells to help reduce their own costs and remain profitable while selling power at lower prices acceptable to the state-owned utilities, Garg said. But this limits competition since small companies \u2014 considered vital for India's clean energy ambitions \u2014 can't match the prices set by corporate giants that make the equipment used to generate solar power.",
      "The U.S. indictment has exposed weaknesses spots in India\u2019s regulatory framework, which is prone to \u201ccrony relationships\u201d between companies and the government, said Joe Athialy, executive director of the New Delhi-based Centre for Financial Accountability.",
      "Most government bids are conducted transparently, with some even driving down prices to unviable levels, said Vinay Rustagi, an independent energy consultant. But occasional \u201cone-off tenders\u201d are poorly publicized or slip under the radar, limiting competition.",
      "The fraud allegations against Adani reflect \"an extreme example of trying to combine solar project development with solar manufacturing,\u201d he said.",
      "Slower progress for India's transition away from fossil fuels matters. It's the most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people in 2023, and its electricity demand is projected to grow by at least 6% annually for the next few years, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "India's solar capacity has been growing rapidly with record-high solar power installations reported in 2024. But while solar makes up 16% of India's total generating capacity, it accounts for only 4% of the electricity used, according to government data compiled by IEEFA. The global average was over 5% in 2023, according to the London-based think tank Ember.",
      "By late 2024, SECI still didn\u2019t have buyers for 9 gigawatts or more than a third of the 24.5 gigawatts of solar power capacity it can offer.",
      "As is true in many places, insufficient storage capacity means solar projects struggle to find buyers since the utilities prefer to purchase stable, ready-to-use power. This is why only 16% of last year\u2019s new solar projects had found buyers by November, compared to 44% the year before, according to a report by the financial services firm JM Financial Institutional Securities.",
      "\u201cIndia\u2019s solar story, while still growing, is slowing down,\u201d said Chandra.",

      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor sentenced Smith to two consecutive 12 \u00bd-year terms, far above federal sentencing guidelines that recommended 3 \u00bd to 4 \u00bc years per count.",
      "Prosecutor David Hagler said the higher sentence was justified because Smith\u2019s actions met the definition of terrorism by \u201cattempting to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Douglas Passon argued against the longer sentence, describing Smith as a \u201chyper-aware individual wanting to create awareness about climate change\u201d who intentionally avoided harming anyone.",
      "In the South Dakota incident, prosecutors said the damage inflicted by Smith caused a shutdown of a pump station on the Keystone XL Pipeline, which led to a leak that damaged neighboring land. Damages to transformers and other infrastructure at a North Dakota power substation caused outages to 243 customers.",
      "Smith told the court his actions were driven by frustration after years of trying to raise awareness of climate change through lawful means. He said he chose remote locations to avoid harming people, and he argued for a lesser sentence, citing his autism and Crohn\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cThis is tantamount to a life sentence, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d Smith said. He expressed doubt he would receive adequate medical care while incarcerated.",

You committed two separate attacks on critical infrastructure 10 months apart and traveled a great distance to do so.\u201d",
      "Passon told The Associated Press on Tuesday that they will appeal. He said the sentence was unjust given Smith's medical and mental conditions and disproportionate compared with similar crimes."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump, who's buying a Tesla to show loyalty to company CEO Elon Musk, has had plenty to say about electric vehicles over the years. Most of it is not good.",
      "Of course, Trump was once a sharp critic of Musk, too, which is especially notable given how tight the pair are now.",
      "A look at some of Trump's comments on EVs \u2014 and Musk:",
      "Trump marked Christmas 2023 with a social media post lumping \u201cAll Electric Car Lunacy\u201d in with a number of political enemies that he said \u201care looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL.\u201d",
      "A few weeks earlier, during a rally in Ankeny, Iowa, Trump said of EVs: \u201cThey don\u2019t go far. They cost a fortune.\u201d He also suggested that the U.S. military was looking at making \u201cArmy tanks all electric\u201d and scoffing, \u201cyou\u2019re in the middle of the desert and you say, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re running low on electric. Do they have a charger around anywhere?\u2019\u201d",
      "In November 2023, at a Claremont, New Hampshire, rally, Trump similarly picked up on distance being an electric vehicle issue: \u201cYou can\u2019t get out of New Hampshire in an electric car.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere are you going? \u2018I\u2019m going to Massachusetts.\u2019 Well, you better get yourself a gas turbine because this car is not going to get you there,\" he said. \u201cWell, you could, if you stop about four times.\u201d",
      "That followed his joke during an event in Clive, Iowa, the previous month: \"Electric cars are good if you have a towing company.\"",
      "Electric vehicles were an especially attractive Trump target during the six-week United Auto Workers strike in September 2023. That's when he told a rally in Clinton Township, Michigan, \u201cYou go all electric so you can drive for 15 minutes before you have to get a charge.\u201d",
      "Trump, a Republican, also posted on his social media site that then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, sold autoworkers \"down the river with his ridiculous all Electric Car Hoax.\" He suggested that promoting electric vehicles \u201cwas the idea of the Radical Left Fascists, Marxists, & Communists\" and that \"Within 3 years, all of these cars will be made in China.\u201d",
      "As on many top issues, Trump has been inconsistent on electric vehicles. During his first term, in September 2020, Trump cheered an all-electric Lordstown Motors Endurance truck at an event outside the White House, calling it an \u201cincredible vehicle.\u201d",
      "After Musk endorsed the former president's bid to return to the White House, Trump began suggesting that electric vehicles could work for some buyers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly,\" Trump said during an August rally in Atlanta.",
      "In a subsequent conversation on X, the social media platform Musk also owns, Trump called Tesla a \u201cgreat product\u201d while noting, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean everybody should have an electric car.\u201d",
      "During his inaugural address, Trump promised, \u201cWe will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry,\" but he also said that Americans will \"be able to buy the car of your choice.\u201d While there was no Biden mandate to force the purchase of EVs, his policies were aimed at encouraging Americans to buy them and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars.",
      "Just like he had a change of heart about EVs, Trump has changed his tune about Musk, who's now one of his advisers. When the pair got into an online feud in 2022, Trump ridiculed Musk for seeking support during his first term.",
      "\u201cWhen Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it\u2019s electric cars that don\u2019t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he\u2019d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, \u2018drop to your knees and beg,\u2019 and he would have done it,\u201d Trump wrote then."

Thousands of jobs are due to be lost at the country\u2019s biggest steelworks, at Port Talbot in Wales, as owner Tata Steel tries to make the unprofitable plant leaner and greener.",

      "U.S. inflation may have cooled a bit last month but it could be a short reprieve as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are widely expected to keep prices elevated in the coming months",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation may have cooled a bit last month but it could be a short reprieve as President Donald Trump's tariffs are widely expected to keep prices elevated in the coming months.",
      "On Wednesday, the Labor Department is expected to report that in February the consumer price index rose 2.9% from a year ago, according to economists surveyed by FactSet. That would be down slightly from 3% in January and the first drop in five months. It fell to a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September.",
      "Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, are also expected to slip to 3.2%, down from 3.3% in January. Economists watch core prices closely because they often provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "Yet both measures have largely become stuck at the levels reached last summer, when a retreat in inflation largely stalled after dropping steeply its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Stubborn inflation would create political problems for Trump, who promised as a candidate to \u201cknock the hell out of inflation.\"",
      "And with Trump imposing \u2014 or threatening to impose \u2014 a wide range of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, China, Europe and India, most economists forecast price growth will likely remain elevated this year.",
      "\u201cThere's no real progress toward that 2% goal,\u201d Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas, a financial services firm, said. \u201cI suspect that you're going to start seeing inflation numbers go the other way.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's update is unlikely to move the inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve much closer toward cutting their key interest rate, which they reduced three times last year amid signs that inflation was fading. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in January that rate cuts were on hold and another reduction is highly unlikely at the Fed's meeting next week.",
      "On a monthly basis, both headline and core prices are projected to have risen 0.3% in February from the previous month. That would be an improvement from January, when overall inflation spiked 0.5%, but increases at that pace are still too large to get inflation on a yearly basis back to the Fed's 2% target.",
      "The biggest wild card for the Fed \u2014 and the economy as a whole \u2014 are the tariffs and Trump's threats to impose more. Since his inauguration in January, Trump has imposed 20% taxes on all imports from China, and 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico, though most of those tariffs have been suspended for a month.",
      "On Wednesday, the administration increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, promising that the taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when Trump's seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown.",
      "The European Union responded in kind almost immediately announcing retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products.",
      "Trump has promised reciprocal duties on countries that tariff exports from the United States, including Europe, India, and South Korea on April 2.",
      "The duties have roiled financial markets and could sharply slow the economy, with some analysts raising the odds of a recession.",
      "Economists at the Yale Budget Lab calculate that the reciprocal tariffs, by themselves, could boost the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest level since 1937, and cost the average household as much as $3,400.",
      "Aside from the tariffs, prices some things, such as eggs, are expected to have gotten even more expensive last month, pushing inflation higher. Avian flu has forced farmers to slaughter more than 160 million birds, including 30 million in January. Average egg prices hit $4.95 a dozen nationwide in February, a record high. The price had consistently been below $2 a dozen for decades before the disease struck.",
      "Economists will also closely watch the prices of new and used cars, auto insurance, airline tickets, and rents, among other items, to get a broader sense of where inflation may be headed. Gas prices are expected to have fallen last month.",
      "Tariffs, according to economics textbooks, are generally expected to result in just a one-time increase in prices, but not necessarily ongoing inflation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made that case in remarks at the Economic Club of New York last week, while acknowledging that prices might be higher.",
      "\u201cWe could get a one-time price adjustment,\" he said. \u201cAccess to cheap goods is not the essence of the American Dream.\u201d",
      "But Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted on Friday that in some cases tariffs could worsen inflation \u2014 for example, if they were enacted as a \u201cseries\u201d of price hikes that caused consumers to expect inflation to move higher.",
      "\u201cWhat really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\u201d Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations for rising prices have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Even the perception that prices will rise can ignite inflation if if households and businesses alter their behavior ahead of time to offset those price increases. Some companies may begin to charge customers if they expect their own costs to increase, for example.",

    "story": [
      "A more than 40-mile long conveyor belt filled with sand stretches from the oil fields of West Texas to New Mexico, all for the purpose of one mission: oil production",
      "KERMIT, Texas -- It's longer than the width of Rhode Island, snakes across the oil fields of the southwest U.S. and crawls at 10 mph \u2013 too slow for a truck and too long for a train.",
      "It's a new sight: the longest conveyer belt in America.",
      "Atlas Energy Solutions, a Texas-based oil field company, has installed a 42-mile long (67 kilometers) conveyer belt to transport millions of tons of sand for hydraulic fracturing. The belt the company named \u201cThe Dune Express\u201d runs from tiny Kermit, Texas, and across state borders into Lea County, New Mexico. Tall and lanky with lids that resemble solar modules, the steel structure could almost be mistaken for a roller coaster.",
      "In the remote West Texas, there are few people to marvel at the unusual machine in Kermit, a city with a population of less than 6,000, where the sand is typically hauled by tractor-trailers. During fracking, liquid is pumped into the ground at a high pressure to create holes, or fractures, that release oil. The sand helps keep the holes open as water, oil and gas flow through it.",
      "But moving the sand by truck is usually a long and potentially dangerous process, according to CEO John Turner. He said massive trucks moving sand and other industrial goods are a common site in the oil-rich Permian Basin and pose a danger to other drivers.",
      "\u201cPretty early on, the delivery of sand via truck was not only inefficient, it was dangerous,\u201d he said.",
      "The conveyor belt, with a freight capacity of 13 tons (11.79 metric tonnes), was designed to bypass and trudge alongside traffic.",
      "Innovation isn't new to the oil and gas industry, nor is the idea to use a conveyor belt to move materials around. Another conveyer belt believed to be the world\u2019s longest conveyor \u2014 at 61 miles (98.17 kilometers) long \u2014 carries phosphorous from a mine in Western Sahara on the northwest coast of Africa, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "When moving sand by truck became a nuisance, an unprecedented and risky investment opportunity arose: constructing a $400 million machine to streamline the production of hydraulic fracturing. The company went public in March 2023, in part, to help pay for the conveyor belt and completed its first delivery in January, Turner said.",
      "The sand sits in a tray-shaped pan with a lid that can be taken off at any point, but most of the it gets offloaded into silos near the Texas and New Mexico border. Along its miles-long journey, the sand is sold and sent to fracking companies who move it by truck for the remainder of the trip.",
      "Keeping the rollers on the belt aligned and making sure it runs smoothly are the biggest maintenance obstacles, according to Turner. The rollers are equipped with chips that signal when its about to fail and need to be replaced. This helps prevent wear and tear and keep the machine running consistently, Turner said.",
      "The belt cuts through a large oil patch where environmentalists have long raised concerns about the industry disturbing local habitats, including those of the sagebrush lizard, which was listed as an endangered species last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "\u201cIn addition to that, we know that the sand will expedite further drilling nearby,\u201d said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. \u201cWe could see more drilling than we otherwise would, which means more air pollution, more spills than we otherwise would.\u201d",
      "The Dune Express currently runs for about 12 to 14 hours a day at roughly half capacity but the company expects to it to be rolling along at all hours later this year.",
      "In New Mexico, Lea County Commissioner Brad Weber said he hopes the belt alleviates traffic on a parallel highway where car crashes are frequent.",
      "\u201cI believe it\u2019s going to make a very positive impact here,\u201d he said.",

      "The Cabinet Office said Tuesday that Japan\u2019s real gross domestic product, which measures the sum value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, also was lower due to higher private inventories than earlier reported.",
      "It was the third straight quarter of expansion, and the government maintains that the economy is moderately recovering. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, seasonally adjusted real GDP grew 0.6%, revised from 0.7%. Private demand shrank 0.3%, worse than the 0.1% given earlier. Exports grew 1.0%, instead of the earlier 1.1%.",
      "Unlike the U.S. and some other nations, Japan has been dogged by deflation, and these lower prices stifle growth. But recent wage growth has kept deflationary trends in check.",
      "The slower growth than expected complicates policymaking for the Bank of Japan, which has been expected to raise interest rates. Annual negotiations between labor and management are resulting in bigger wage increases and the central bank has said it will raise its benchmark rate if the economy holds up and prices continue to rise at the projected steady rate of 2%.",

      "The Associated Press has obtained a document showing that the Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing",
      "The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The action is part of a slew of cuts and funding freezes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, largely at the direction of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, that have rattled the affordable-housing industry.",
      "Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it's a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation's housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans.",
      "The program has already awarded the money to projects that would upgrade at least 25,000 affordable units across the country, and details of how it will be wound down remain unclear.",
      "A spokesperson for HUD did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But an internal document reviewed by the AP said that the program is being \u201cterminated\u201d at the direction of DOGE. Two HUD workers, who have knowledge of the program and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, confirmed the directive to shutter it.",
      "On it's face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing.",
      "But the money plays a much larger role in preserving affordable units.",
      "Projects that use the funds are required to keep their buildings affordable for up to 25 years. The money is also leveraged to pull in other investments for major repairs and renovations needed to keep the buildings livable.",
      "It's like building a Jenga tower, where one of the program's grants or loans \u2014 which range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 is a bottom block and each new block is another investment, experts said.",
      "This money \u201cwas essential in order for the project to come together,\u201d said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. \u201cProjects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.\u201d",
      "The news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options \u2014 most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year.",
      "The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it's first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments.",
      "The potential loss \u201cseriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\u201d said Greg Franks, president of the property\u2019s management company, adding that the work is \"needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are depending on that $10 million,\u201d he said.",
      "So, too, are Hase and Starr, a retired couple in their 70s who have lived there for 16 years.",
      "They fill their balcony with geraniums and petunias, count the eagles at a nearby park and live off of meager Social Security incomes. They learned about the potential funding loss in a letter from the apartment's management company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kinda terrifying, it\u2019s almost like getting news from a doctor that something's going to take your life in six months or a year,\u201d Hase told the AP in a phone call.",
      "\u201cWe're from an era where the wages weren't there, so our Social Security ...\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cSucks,\u201d pitched in Starr.",

      "\u201cAnd we're the lucky ones because we've got two social securities coming in,\" she said.",
      "But being lucky ones still doesn't count for much in today's rental market. \u201cPrices keep going up, I've looked, and there's no way,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between living and not being able to live,\" he said.",
      "HUD's lack of communication about the program's future sent organizations in search of contingency plans, though roughly two dozen projects will still get funding, one HUD employee told the AP. The rest are in limbo.",
      "\u201cIf these funds aren\u2019t reinstated, we will certainly seek other funding to fill that gap. The reality is that will take time and will inevitably make the project more expensive,\u201d Travis Phillips of the Housing Development Center said of funding for Smith Tower.",

    "story": [
      "To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats",
      "NEW YORK -- To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats. But to some of her colleagues, she is giving a voice to those who feel they can't speak out.",
      "Ortiz is an administrative judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- the federal agency in charge of enforcing U.S. workplace anti-discrimination laws that has undergone tumultuous change since President Donald Trump took office. Like millions of other federal employees, Ortiz opened an ominous email on Jan. 28 titled \u201cFork in the Road\" giving them the option to resign from their positions as part of the government\u2019s cost-cutting measures directed by Trump and carried out by DOGE under Musk, an unelected official.",
      "Her alarm grew when her supervisor directed administrative judges in her New York district office to pause all their current LGBTQ+ cases and send them to Washington for further review in order to comply with Trump's executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Ortiz decried management\u2019s lack of action in response to the directive, which she said was antithetical to the EEOC\u2019s mission, and called upon some 185 colleagues in an email to \u201cresist\u201d complying with \u201cillegal mandates.\u201d But that email was \u201cmysteriously\u201d deleted, she said.",
      "The next day, after yet another frustrating \u201cFork in the Road\u201d update, Ortiz decided to go big, emailing the EEOC's acting chair Andrea Lucas directly and copying more than 1,000 colleagues with the subject line, \u201cA Spoon is Better than a Fork.\" In it, Ortiz questioned Lucas's fitness to serve as acting chair, \u201cmuch less hold a license to practice law.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know I take a great personal risk in sending out this message. But, at the end of the day, my actions align with what the EEOC was charged with doing under the law,\u201d Ortiz wrote. \u201cI will not compromise my ethics and my duty to uphold the law. I will not cower to bullying and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz is just one person, but her email represents a larger pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping changes to federal agencies amid an environment of confusion, anger and chaos. It is also Ortiz\u2019s way of taking a stand against the leadership of a civil rights agency that last month moved to dismiss seven of its own cases representing transgender workers, marking a major departure from its prior interpretation of the law.",
      "Right after sending her mass email, Ortiz said she received a few supportive responses from colleagues -- and one calling her unprofessional. Within an hour, though, the message disappeared and she lost her ability to send any further emails.",
      "But it still made it onto the internet. The email was recirculated on Bluesky and it received more than 10,000 \u201cupvotes\u201d on Reddit after someone posted it with the comment, \u201cWow I wish I had that courage.\u201d",
      "\u201cAN AMERICAN HERO,\u201d one Reddit user deemed Ortiz, a sentiment that was seconded by more than 2,000 upvoters. \u201cWho is this freedom fighter bringing on the fire?\" wrote another.",
      "The EEOC did not feel the same way. The agency revoked her email privileges for about a week and issued her a written reprimand for \u201cdiscourteous conduct.\u201d",
      "Contacted by The AP, a spokesperson for the EEOC said: \u201cWe will refrain from commenting on internal communications and personnel matters. However, we would note that the agency has a long-standing policy prohibiting unauthorized all-employee emails, and all employees were reminded of that policy recently.\u201d",
      "A month later, Ortiz has no regrets.",
      "\u201cIt was not really planned out, it was just from the heart,\u201d the 53-year-old told The Associated Press in an interview, adding that partisan politics have nothing to do with her objections and that the public deserves the EEOC's protection, including transgender workers. \u201cThis is how I feel and I\u2019m not pulling any punches. And I will stand by what I wrote every day of the week, all day on Sunday.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she never intended for her email to go beyond the EEOC, describing it as a \u201clove letter\u201d to her colleagues. But, she added, \u201cI hope that it lights a fire under people.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she has received \u201ca ton\u201d of support privately in the month since sending her email, including a thank-you letter from a California retiree telling her to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d Open support among her EEOC colleagues beyond Reddit and Bluesky, however, has proven more elusive.",
      "\u201cI think people are just really scared,\u201d she said.",
      "William Resh, a University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy professor who studies how administrative structure and political environments affect civil servants, weighed in on why federal workers may choose to say nothing even if they feel their mission is being undermined.",
      "\u201cWe can talk pie in the sky, mission orientation and all these other things. But at the end of the day, people have a paycheck to bring home, and food to put on a table and a rent to pay,\u201d Resh said.",
      "The more immediate danger, he said, is the threat to one's livelihood, or inviting a manager's ire.",
      "\u201cAnd so then that\u2019s where you get this kind of muted response on behalf of federal employees, that you don\u2019t see a lot of people speaking out within these positions because they don\u2019t want to lose their job,\u201d Resh said. \u201cWho would?\u201d",
      "Richard LeClear, a U.S. Air Force veteran and EEOC staffer who is retiring early at 64 to avoid serving under the Trump administration, said Ortiz\u2019s email was \u201cspot on,\u201d but added that other colleagues who agreed with her may fear speaking out themselves.",
      "\u201cRetaliation is a very real thing,\u201d LeClear said.",
      "Ortiz, who has been a federal employee for 14 years and at the EEOC for six, said she isn\u2019t naive about the potential fallout. She has hired attorneys, and maintains that her actions are protected whistleblower activity. As of Friday, she still had a job but she is not a lifetime appointee and is aware that her health care, pension and source of income could all be at risk.",
      "Ortiz is nonetheless steadfast: \u201cIf they fire me, I\u2019ll find another avenue to do this kind of work, and I\u2019ll be okay. They will have to physically march me out of the office.\u201d",
      "Many of Ortiz\u2019s colleagues have children to support and protect, which puts them in a more difficult position than her to speak out, Ortiz acknowledged. She said her legal education and American citizenship also put her in a position to be able to make change.",
      "Her parents, who came to the United States from Puerto Rico in the 1950s with limited English skills, ingrained in her the value of standing up for others. Their firsthand experience with the Civil Rights Movement, and her own experience growing up in mostly white spaces in Garden City on Long Island, primed Ortiz to defend herself and others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in my DNA,\u201d she said. \u201cI will use every shred of privilege that I have to lean into this.\u201d",
      "Ortiz received her undergraduate degree at Columbia University, and her law degree at Fordham University. She knew she wanted to become a judge ever since her high school mock trial as a Supreme Court justice.",
      "Civil rights has been a throughline in her career, and Ortiz said she was \u201csuper excited\u201d when she landed her job at the EEOC.",
      "\u201cThis is how I wanted to finish up my career,\" she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that happens.\u201d",

      "Bridgeman was a popular fixture in Louisville after his playing days, and Mayor Craig Greenberg announced his death, saying the city had \u201clost a kind, generous and groundbreaking legend.\u201d",
      "\"He was an All-American at U of L ... and a self-made billionaire,\" Greenberg said in a statement. \u201cYet I will most remember Junior Bridgeman for his quiet, impactful assistance to others in need\u201d as well as his love for his family and his \u201cnever-ending support for our community.\u201d",

      "Bridgeman, a native of East Chicago, Indiana, played for Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum at Louisville. In three seasons, he scored 1,348 points, grabbed 657 rebounds and in his senior season led the Cardinals to the 1975 Final Four, where they lost to eventual national champion UCLA in a 75-74 thriller.",
      "Bridgeman was involved in one of the biggest trades in NBA history at the start of his professional career.

      "Bridgeman was a longtime franchisee for Wendy\u2019s and Chili\u2019s restaurants, at one time operating more than 450 locations in 20 states, the university said. He became a bottler for Coca-Cola and bought Ebony and Jet magazines, the school said.",

      "Bridgeman was part of the foursome that owns Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. He also served on the boards of Churchill Downs racetrack, the University of Louisville and Fifth Third Bank, among others. He and his wife, Doris, hosted a Kentucky Derby party that served as a fundraiser.",
      "\u201cHe is the blueprint to so many current and former athletes across sports that success doesn't end when you're done playing,\u201d Johnson wrote.",

      "Former Wisconsin star Baylee Marabella had to play hockey alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area",
      "MILWAUKEE -- When Baylee Marabella got interested in ice hockey while growing up in Wisconsin, she had to play alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area.",
      "That isn\u2019t as much of a problem in hockey hotbeds such as Wisconsin anymore with a steady increase in the number of girls playing the sport. That trend helped launch the coaching career of Marabella, who was known as Baylee Wellhausen when she played on three Frozen Four teams with Wisconsin from 2014-18.",
      "Marabella now coaches Milwaukee School of Engineering, which just finished its inaugural season in Division III competition. It\u2019s one of more than two dozen D-III schools to start women\u2019s hockey teams over the last decade, capitalizing on the relative lack of cost compared to doing so in Division I.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Marabella said of the rapid growth.",
      "MSOE was one of 78 schools to play women\u2019s ice hockey this year at the Division III level, which doesn't offer athletic scholarships. That represents a 50% increase from 2015, when there were 52 schools playing the sport at this level.",
      "Marabella believes those numbers can keep going up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more girls who want to play college (hockey), so as we keep moving forward, the demand is going to be higher,\u201d Marabella said.",
      "Women\u2019s hockey in North America is on the rise and not only at the Division III level. The Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League is two months from completing its second season amid signs that attendance is up. The six-team league is drawing an average of 7,300 fans this season \u2013 up from 5,500 last year \u2013 and might expand by as many as two franchise next season.",
      "USA Hockey had 73,083 registrations among girls in 2023-24, a 47.4% increase over its 2013-14 total (49,587). Boys registrations increased by 4.8% over the same time, from 302,303 to 316,737.",
      "\u201cOverall, the skill level has gotten so much better over the years that it becomes one of those sports that was almost a no-brainer to be adding at the Division III level,\u201d said Joe Cranston, who coaches defending champion Wisconsin-River Falls, which hosts the D-III championship March 28-30. The 12-team tournament begins Saturday on campus sites.",
      "There are 44 women's hockey programs in Division I and Division II, a 12.8% rise from 2015 (39). The two divisions compete in a single national tournament, which ends this year with the Women's Frozen Four March 21-23 in Minneapolis.",
      "The modest growth at the higher level can be blamed on the bigger costs with adding a D-I program. Ice availability is a factor for any team at any level, and setting budgets is difficult for any athletic director dealing with the NCAA House settlement and name, image and likeness compensation questions.",
      "Minnesota reported operating expenses of a little over $3.6 million for women\u2019s hockey in 2023-24. Michigan released a feasibility study saying expenses would run about $4.5 million annually if it started a women\u2019s hockey program.",
      "By contrast, Wisconsin-River Falls reported $197,087 in women\u2019s hockey expenses in its 2024 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act survey.",
      "Michelle McAteer has a unique perspective, as a new commissioner of a Division I conference (the Western Collegiate Hockey Association) who finished a 14-season run coaching Division III program Augsburg last year.",
      "\u201cHockey\u2019s an expensive sport to operate, and to operate a rink is an expensive investment,\u201d McAteer said. \u201cAt the Division III level, not everyone has their own rinks on campus. You can get by playing in community rinks and renting. The facility demands at the Division I level are quite different. The investment and infrastructure are a lot more. Everything is more. They have more significant travel. They have a more significant equipment budget, the staffing differences.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s probably enough talent nowadays to accommodate more Division I programs. The difference is apparent on the ice.",
      "\u201cTen to 12 years ago, there were a lot of teams at the Division I level that might have had one good line, a line-and-a-half, maybe two,\u201d said coach Mark Johnson, whose Badgers have been the top-ranked team in women's hockey most of the season. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s got two or three lines, maybe four lines, that can compete and play at a real high level.\u201d",
      "Because the schools in larger divisions haven\u2019t added women\u2019s hockey programs at a rate that correlates with the growth in the sport at the youth level, it\u2019s created more opportunities for Division III schools.",
      "\u201cI have kids on my team who were All-Americans 15 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cKids who were Division I players 10 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now.\u201d",
      "Plattsburgh State won five titles in a six-year stretch from 2014-19, but there\u2019s been a different champion for each of the last five tournaments.",
      "Norwich won in 2018, Plattsburgh State in 2019, Middlebury in 2022, Gustavus Adolphus in 2023 and Wisconsin-River Falls last year. There were no Division III championships in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic.",
      "\u201cMost years there\u2019s maybe three or four teams that could win it all,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cI think this year there\u2019s probably twice that, probably seven or eight teams that could win the whole thing.\u201d",
      "SUNY Oswego athletic director Wendy McManus, the head of the NCAA Division III women\u2019s hockey committee, says smaller schools will continue adding the sport as long as youth participation stays strong.",
      "\u201cI do think eventually it will level off,\u201d McManus said. \u201cI say that because you don\u2019t see California schools or true West Coast schools playing hockey that much. We say \u2018West\u2019 is basically Minnesota, Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "That growth has provided welcome opportunities that might not have been available a decade earlier.",
      "For instance, MSOE\u2019s roster includes forward Hannah Baumann of Wausau, Wisconsin, who said she grew up idolizing Marabella and was a big Badgers fan. Baumann used to have to drive an hour to practice because of the relative lack of girls hockey teams.",
      "There now are more girls teams than ever, and some gather in the stands for MSOE\u2019s home games. That has particular meaning for forward Helen Bechthold, who grew up in the Milwaukee area playing for one of those youth programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see they have all-girls teams playing now, because when I was playing, they didn\u2019t have all-girls teams,\u201d said Bechthold, who grew up playing with boys. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see. A lot of them were like, \u2018You played where we play\u2019 and stuff like that. That definitely makes me happy. I\u2019m happy they have that opportunity.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left Achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured,\u201d Woods said.",

      "Andrea Kimi Antonelli once hid in a stack of tires to get through security and into the Formula 1 paddock. Now the 18-year-old Italian is Lewis Hamilton's successor at Mercedes.",
      "Antonelli is among F1's biggest intake of new drivers in years as top teams put some trust in youth. Six of the 20 drivers on the 2025 grid are starting their first full seasons in F1. Some could potentially compete for wins. Others already risk losing a hard-won F1 seat.",
      "An unexpectedly talented Formula 2 field last season came at a time when some F1 teams were keen to move on from older drivers like Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas. Switching in 2025 gives teams a chance to let youngsters gain experience before the F1 car design rules change radically for 2026.",
      "Here's a look at the rookie class:",
      "Stepping into a seven-time champion's shoes at Mercedes puts the spotlight on Antonelli, who is set to become the third-youngest F1 driver ever. The Italian wants to be known as just \u201cthe next Mercedes driver\u201d because of Hamilton's legacy. The first time Antonelli visited an F1 paddock was age eight in 2014 when his father Marco \u2014 who ran a team in a support series \u2014 hid him in a stack of tires under an umbrella to get past security and into the German Grand Prix. \u201cThat was a really cool experience,\u201d he said last month. Antonelli had a stellar record in junior series and was sixth in F2 last year but a heavy crash in practice for Mercedes at Monza in August was a tough introduction to F1.",
      "The Red Bull driver is the odd man out in this list because he\u2019s taken part in 11 F1 races since 2023, though never a full season. He says he\u2019ll feel \u201cmore like a rookie\u201d at the start of the season on tracks he hasn\u2019t raced before. Partnering four-time champion Max Verstappen as the replacement for Perez is a daunting task for Lawson, who knocked Verstappen out of qualifying in only his third F1 race in Singapore in 2023. The New Zealander needs to justify Red Bull\u2019s decision to elevate him over his 2024 teammate \u2014 and former roommate \u2014 Yuki Tsunoda, who outperformed Lawson over their six races together last year.",
      "It's less than a year since Bearman burst onto the scene in F1 with a combative seventh-place finish for Ferrari in Saudi Arabia while Carlos Sainz Jr. was sidelined because of surgery. He'd never previously raced in Jeddah and was racing with two days' notice. Bearman beat experienced teammate Nico H\u00fclkenberg in two races for Haas later that year and is now a full-time Haas driver for 2025. Bearman remains part of Ferrari's junior program but displacing regular Ferrari drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc is unlikely any time soon.",
      "The son of legendary motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan enters 2025 with his F1 career under threat as soon as it has begun. Alpine's decision to sign ex-Williams driver Franco Colapinto as reserve means a would-be replacement is available if Doohan doesn't impress team management. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have pressure on your shoulders because you\u2019re in such a cut-throat sport,\u201d Doohan said. The Australian driver placed third in F2 in 2023 but didn't race at all last year until a surprise entry for the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Finishing 15th, he was far off the pace of teammate Pierre Gasly in seventh.",
      "Lawson's promotion to Red Bull left an opening at its second team, now rebranded Racing Bulls, for F2 runner-up Hadjar. The French driver arrives at a team with a history of changing drivers mid-season if they don't perform. Even eight-time Grand Prix winner Daniel Ricciardo didn't last a full year there in 2024.",
      "Despite winning the F2 title last season, beating Hadjar, Antonelli and Bearman, Bortoleto's arrival in F1 has been overshadowed by his former rivals. That's partly because his new team Sauber struggled last year and is marking time before a full rebrand as the Audi works team in 2026. With a helmet design paying tribute to three-time champion Ayrton Senna, Bortoleto is F1's first full-time Brazilian driver since 2017.",

      "LAWRENCE, Kan. -- This was a time early in the season when Kansas seemed to be an insurmountable juggernaut, full of high-profile transfers such as Zeke Mayo and AJ Storr, All-American candidates such as Hunter Dickinson and veterans accustomed to winning.",
      "They were the preseason No. 1 in the AP Top 25. And for several weeks, the Jayhawks played like it.",
      "But things hardly went according to script the rest of the season. They lost to longtime rival Missouri in a non-conference game, and dropped rare home games to West Virginia, Houston and Texas Tech. They plummeted out of the Top 25 altogether, ending a run of 80 consecutive weeks in the poll, and tumbled down the Big 12 standings.",
      "Now, they enter their conference tournament as the No. 6 seed. And perhaps most importantly, they could be staring at the same seeding \u2014 or worse \u2014 in the NCAA tourney, where coach Bill Self's teams have never been worse than a No. 4.",
      "\u201cI think we're talented enough. We were the preseason No. 1 team in the country for a reason,\u201d Dickinson said after a confidence-boosting win over Arizona on Saturday. \u201cWe have the talent. But it's just a matter of going out there and showing it.\u201d",
      "They will get their chance beginning Wednesday, when they play Utah or UCF in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament.",
      "Kansas isn't the only once-highly ranked team trying to build some late-season momentum, though. In fact, the Jayhawks are one of 14 teams that were ranked in the preseason poll but no longer reside in it. Many are still locks to make the NCAA field Sunday, but others are teetering on the bubble and a couple may need to win their league tournaments just to qualify.",
      "Arizona dropped from the Top 25 this week after its loss at Allen Fieldhouse, but the No. 3 seed in the Big 12 tourney is still a good bet for a good seed on Selection Sunday. So is two-time reigning national champion UConn, which was ranked third in the preseason Top 25 but dropped out in early February and is seeded third in the Big East Tournament.",
      "Other unranked locks include Creighton, the second seed in the Big East; Gonzaga, the No. 2 seed in the West Coast behind Saint Mary's; and Ole Miss, which was ranked as high as No. 16 this season and is seeded eighth in the SEC tourney.",
      "Baylor was ranked eighth in the preseason Top 25 but fell out by mid-January, and going 4-6 over its final 10 games ahead of the Big 12 tourney \u2014 where it is seeded seventh \u2014 hardly helps. Still, the Bears of VJ Edgecomb and Co. took second-ranked Houston to the wire last weekend, and picking up a win in Kansas City this week should be enough.",
      "Arkansas, which was preseason No. 16, enters the SEC tourney having won four of five, and a win or two as the No. 9 seed could be important. The same goes for preseason No. 17 Indiana, which is likewise seeded ninth in the Big Ten Tournament.",
      "North Carolina is starting to resemble the preseason No. 9 in the country, but a slew of early losses \u2014 Stanford, Wake Forest, Pitt and Duke during one five-game stretch \u2014 has made life tough for the Tar Heels. They're seeded fifth in the ACC and could need at least two wins to make the NCAA field, and perhaps to save coach Hubert Davis' job.",
      "Texas also could be playing for its coach, Rodney Terry, along with an NCAA berth. The Longhorns were preseason No. 19 but out by early January. They are are seeded 13th in the SEC and open with fellow bubble-dweller Vanderbilt on Wednesday.",
      "Cincinnati was ranked 20th and Rutgers was 25th in the preseason Top 25, but both probably need to win their conference tournaments to make the NCAA field. The Bearcats are seeded 13th in the Big 12 and play Oklahoma State on Tuesday, while the Scarlet Knights are 11th in the Big Ten and open with USC on Wednesday.",

Entering Monday, the five teams in the Southeast \u2014 Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Charlotte and Washington \u2014 had a combined record of 113-200, that winning percentage of .369 set to be the worst of any division ever.",
      "The official low bar, for now, is a winning percentage .384 by the Central Division in 1970-71. That was a season where Baltimore won the division at 42-40 and Atlanta, Cincinnati and Cleveland combined to go 84-162.",
      "And this is the crazy part about the Southeast: this season, Atlanta, Orlando and Miami seem pretty much like locks for the play-in tournament at this point, meaning two of those teams are going to make the playoffs even though none are on pace to finish with a winning record.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know division-wise, but I just know it seems in both conferences it\u2019s a dogfight,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWith the play-in and everything, it\u2019s been really good for the league. A lot more teams are competing.\u201d",
      "The Southeast being the NBA's official battleground division is not a new thing. There won't be a 50-win team from the Southeast this year; that's no surprise, because there's been only one \u2014 the 2021-22 Heat, who went 53-29 \u2014 in the last 10 seasons.",
      "Let's put that in some perspective. The Atlantic Division has had 15 teams reach the 50-win mark over the last decade, the Northwest and Pacific have each had 11, the Central and Southwest have each had nine. Boston is on pace to do it for a sixth time in that span, Cleveland has done it five including this season already, Golden State has done it five and Toronto has five such seasons in that span as well.",
      "The Southeast? Nope, just the one.",
      "Forget winning 50 games. Over the last decade there have been only 17 instances \u2014 out of 50 chances \u2014 of a Southeast team simply finishing a regular season with a winning record.

That said, there are three teams still very much in the race for something.",

The Southeast might end the year with the worst divisional record in NBA history, but there's still a slew for the Hawks, Magic and Heat to play for.",

They have no other losses and won the SEC regular season and conference tournaments. Staley feels they should be No. 1 by how tough a schedule they've faced.",
      "The Bruins have just two losses on their schedule this season, both coming to rival USC. They went through a difficult Big Ten season and came away unblemished other than the losses to the Trojans. UCLA had a convincing win over South Carolina in November that vaunted them up to No. 1 for 12 weeks.",

      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

    "summary": "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
    "story": [
      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",
      "\u201cAs a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,\u201d he said."

      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers urge the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests in coming decades",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday urged the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests as part of efforts to stop the birds from crowding out a smaller type of owl that's facing potential extinction.",
      "The 19 lawmakers \u2014 led by Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas conservative, and Democrat Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California liberal \u2014 claimed the killings would be \u201cgrossly expensive\u201d and cost $3,000 per bird.",
      "They questioned if the shootings would help native populations of northern spotted owls, which have long been controversial because of logging restrictions in the birds' forest habitat beginning in the 1990s, and the closely related California spotted owl.",
      "Barred owls are native to eastern North America and started appearing in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. They\u2019ve quickly displaced many spotted owls, which are smaller birds that need larger territories to breed.",
      "An estimated 100,000 barred owls now live within a range that contains only about 7,100 spotted owls, according to federal officials.",
      "Under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan approved last year, trained shooters would target barred owls over 30 years across a maximum of about 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) in California, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The plan did not include a cost estimate. But the lawmakers said in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that it could top $1.3 billion based on extrapolating costs from a grant awarded to the the Hoopa Valley Native American Tribe in California to kill up to 1,500 barred owls.",
      "\u201cThis is an inappropriate and inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \"This latest plan is an example of our federal government attempting to supersede nature and control environmental outcomes at great cost.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the cost estimate and the owl removal program. The agency's plan called for more than 2,400 barred owls to be removed this year and for that number to ramp up to more than 15,500 birds annually beginning in 2027.",
      "Scientists for years have been shooting barred owls on an experimental basis and officials say the results show the strategy could halt spotted owl declines. As of last year, about 4,500 barred owls were killed on the West Coast by researchers since 2009.",
      "Killing one bird species to save others has divided wildlife advocates and is reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants. Or when, to preserve warblers, cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests were killed. The barred owl removals would be among the largest such effort to date involving birds of prey, researchers and wildlife advocates said.",
      "Barred owls arrived in the Pacific Northwest via the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold, or via Canada\u2019s boreal forests, which have become warmer and more hospitable as the climate changes, researchers said.",
      "Their spread has undermined decades of spotted owl restoration efforts that previously focused on protecting forests where they live. That included logging restrictions under former President Bill Clinton that ignited bitter political fights and temporarily helped slow the spotted owl\u2019s decline.",

      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",
      "Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details haven't been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along.",
      "During Nissan's demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app.",
      "Takeshi Kimura, the Mobility and AI Laboratory engineer at Nissan, insists an automaker is more adept at integrating self-driving technology with the overall workings of a car \u2014 simply because it knows cars better.",
      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",
      "Autonomous vehicles can serve a real need given the nation\u2019s shrinking population, including a shortage of drivers.",
      "Other companies are working on the technology in Japan, including startups like Tier IV, which is pushing an open source collaboration on autonomous driving technology.",
      "So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts.

      "The news came less than 24 hours after the botched landing attempt by Texas-based Intuitive Machines.",

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",

      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City, rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday.",
      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",
      "And the first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance in the United States found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.",
      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",
      "In December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that monarch butterflies receive protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.",

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",
      "\"Apparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\" Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d",

      "The European measures were designed to match the scope of those U.S. tariffs, which the European Union said would be worth about $28 billion. The countermeasures were expected to begin on April 1 and be fully in place by April 13, the commission said.",
      "\"In the meantime, we will always remain open to negotiation,\" von der Leyen said.",
      "The countermeasures comprise two steps, the first of which is to restore on April 1 a set of previously suspended 2018 and 2020 countermeasures against the U.S. on a range of products.",
      "For step two, member states will then put in place by mid-April new countermeasures targeting about 18 billion euros worth of U.S. goods entering the bloc.",

      "LONDON -- The prospects for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine are \"in Moscow's hands,\" a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said following successful U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.",
      "Andriy Yermak -- the head of Zelenskyy's office -- was part of the Ukrainian delegation that met with American representatives in Jeddah, where both teams agreed to pursue a 30-day ceasefire and use the pause in fighting as a launchpad for full peace negotiations to end Russia's 3-year-old invasion of its neighbor.",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to accept a 30-day ceasefire if Russia agrees,\" Yermak wrote on Telegram on Wednesday morning. \"This is a necessary step to begin work on real security guarantees and preparing the final terms of a peace agreement.\"",

      "Trump has aligned with Russian narratives about the conflict, framing Ukraine as the key impediment to peace, falsely blaming Kyiv for starting the war, undermining Zelenskyy's legitimacy as president and seeking to recoup years of American aid via a controversial minerals sharing deal.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration announced a freeze on U.S. military aid to and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Tuesday's meeting in Saudi Arabia saw that pause lifted, officials said.",

      "Kyiv has been striving to prove its readiness for peace, while stressing that no deal can succeed without American security guarantees to deter repeat Russian aggression. Ukrainian leaders have also cast doubt on Russia's apparent readiness to end the fighting and urged their U.S. partners to be wary of the Kremlin.",
      "Following Tuesday's talks, Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram of the 30-day ceasefire plan, \"Ukraine accepts this proposal, we consider it positive, we are ready to take this step. The United States of America needs to convince Russia to do so.\"",
      "\"We agree, and if the Russians agree, the silence will take effect at that very moment,\" he added. \"An important element in today's discussions is America's readiness to restore defense assistance to Ukraine and intelligence support.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is ready for peace,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"Russia must also show whether it is ready to end the war -- or continue it. The time has come for the whole truth. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine.\"",
      "Trump told reporters Wednesday that he expects imminent further talks with Russian representatives. \"Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it,\" the president said of the proposed ceasefire.",
      "\"We're going to meet with them later on today and tomorrow, and hopefully we'll be able to wipe out a deal,\" he continued. \"But I think the ceasefire is very important. If we can get Russia to do it, that'll be great. If we can't, we just keep going on and people are going to get killed. Lots of people.\"",
      "When asked how close a ceasefire was, Trump responded, \"Well, I hope it'll be over the next few days. I'd like to see. I know we have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow, and some great conversations hopefully will ensue,\" Trump said.",

      "Seven weeks into his term, concerns are growing about a possible recession.",
      "Then-candidate Donald Trump, at a campaign rally last August as the 2024 race for the White House was heating up, made a promise to voters to quickly bring economic relief if elected.",
      "\"Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,\" he said at a rally in Montana, where he told supporters: \"This election is about saving our economy.\"",
      "A week later, he made a show of displaying cartons of eggs, bacon, milk and other grocery products outside his New Jersey golf course as he railed against the Biden administration's policies.",
      "\"When I win, I will immediately bring prices down,\" Trump said at the time.",
      "Trump started to change his tune not long after his victory, however, saying in an interview with Time magazine, published in December, that bringing down food costs will be \"very hard.\"",
      "Now, seven weeks into his administration, Trump's tariff policies are roiling the markets and fears of a recession are growing.",
      "During his first major speech to Congress and the nation since his inauguration, Trump last week defended his imposition of steep levies on key U.S. trading partners like Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "\"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There will be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much,\" he said.",
      "Since then, his back-and-forth on tariffs for Canada and Mexico caused a stock market meltdown, with the S&P 500 recording its worst week since last September.",
      "During an interview on Fox News \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Trump was asked if he is expecting a recession this year after the Atlanta Federal Reserve projected negative GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025.",
      "\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Trump responded. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"",
      "He was pressed on his hesitation to strike down the possibility later Sunday as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One.",
      "\"I\u2019ll tell you what, of course you hesitate. Who knows? All I know is this: We\u2019re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we\u2019re going to become so rich, you\u2019re not going to know where to spend all that money,\" he said. \"I\u2019m telling you, you just watch. We\u2019re going to have jobs. We\u2019re going to have open factories. It\u2019s going to be great.\"",
      "Stock losses continued Monday and Tuesday after Trump's comments. More tariffs are being implemented against steel and aluminum products on Wednesday, and Trump's pledging to move forward with \"reciprocal\" tariffs starting on April 2.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, Trump amended his answer on recession concerns as he looked at Tesla vehicles at the White House, where he took questions from reporters for first time since his Sunday remarks.",
      "ABC News White House Correspondent Karen Travers asked Trump directly, \"Do you think there will be a recession?\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t see it at all. I think this country is going to boom,\" Trump responded. \"But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing. But the results are going to be 20 times greater.\"",
      "The White House earlier Tuesday sought to cast the market turmoil as a \"snapshot of a moment in time\" before Trump's policies bear their intended impact.",
      "\"We are in a period of economic transition,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters when asked directly if she could reassure Americans there wouldn't be a downturn.",
      "Leavitt blamed the Biden administration for what she said was an \"economic disaster\" left to Trump -- despite Biden overseeing a soft economic landing -- and pointed to other indicators she said were positive signs for Americans, including a boost in manufacturing jobs last month and reports of companies looking to expand operations in America.",
      "\"The American people, CEOs, and people on Wall Street and on Main Street should bet on this president,\" Leavitt told reporters. \"He is a dealmaker. He is a businessman and he's doing what's right for our country.\"",

      "The race could preview how Wisconsin voters feel about Trump's second term.",
      "A closely watched Wisconsin Supreme Court election takes center stage as Republican-backed Brad Schimel and Democratic-backed Susan Crawford are set to debate on Wednesday, locked in a race for a seat that is technically nonpartisan but has become the center of a political firestorm.",
      "The April 1 election will determine which of the candidates, vying to replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, will help determine the ideological bent of the court, which currently leans liberal. The winner will join the bench as the court grapples with hot-button issues such as abortion access and redistricting.",
      "The race could also preview how voters in the battleground state feel a few months into President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "\"They're using it as a test as to President Trump's popularity,\" Janine Geske, a law professor at Marquette University and a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, told ABC News. \"He took Wisconsin in the election. And the question is, how will this election go?\"",
      "The debate, hosted by ABC affiliate WISN-TV and the Marquette University Law School, will air online and on ABC News affiliates across Wisconsin at 7 p.m. Central time on Wednesday.",
      "Schimel, the candidate backed by Republicans, is a former state attorney general who is a circuit court judge in Waukesha County.",
      "\"I got in this race 16 months before Election Day because I recognize \u2026 you gotta meet voters where they are,\" Schimel told WISN in February.",
      "Crawford, backed by Democrats, is a Dane County circuit court judge and a former private attorney. She at points represented Democratic-aligned groups such as Planned Parenthood, an organization supporting abortion access.",
      "\"I have spent a lot of time talking about my record, my background as a prosecutor, as a lawyer representing people in court and standing up for their rights,\" Crawford told WISN in February.",
      "Over $40 million has been spent on ad reservations, both aired already and for future reservations, in the race, according to advertisement tracking firm AdImpact. (Recent polling from the Marquette University Law School showed a sizable percentage of voters do not have an opinion on either candidate.)",
      "The election is also seen as one indication of Elon Musk's influence beyond Washington, where he has overseen major cuts to the federal government.",
      "A conservative group affiliated with Musk, Building America's Future, has spent more than $1.6 million on television ads in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, while another one Musk backs, America PAC, has spent over $6 million on get-out-the-vote efforts and digital media, according to state campaign finance records. The expenditures are marked as either opposing Crawford or supporting Schimel.",
      "Musk himself has not weighed in much directly about the race, but he posted on X last month urging people to \"vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\" Schimel has said he has never spoken to Musk and told reporters in February, \"I don't have any agenda that I'm working alongside anyone.\"",
      "These groups' investment in the race has sparked pushback from Democrats.",
      "\"Wisconsin voters don't like Elon Musk running our federal government and they don't want him buying elections in Wisconsin either,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement on Monday.",
      "Crawford's own support has not been free of scrutiny. Schimel and his supporters have pointed to major donors seemingly supporting Crawford, including liberal billionaire George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat. According to state campaign finance records, those individuals donated to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, and the state party has donated $2 million to Crawford.",
      "Crawford has said she has made no promises to any donors and has also emphasized her independence.",
      "While this election is being eyed nationally as the first major race of 2025, experts and supporters of either candidate say it also could have major impacts for the state of Wisconsin, including on issues such as redistricting, voting rights and abortion access.",
      "For example, there is a Wisconsin Supreme Court case regarding if the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion, which the court might consider after the new justice is seated.",
      "Wisconsin has an 1849 statute on the books that would effectively limit all abortions in the state, although the law is not enforced.",
      "If the court were to determine in a different case that the statute is still in effect and later that abortion access is not protected by the Wisconsin Constitution, it could mean abortion is determined illegal in Wisconsin, Chad Oldfather, another law professor at Marquette University, told ABC News.",
      "The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Schimel had previously indicated support for leaving the 1849 law in place. More recently, Schimel told WISN that on abortion access cases, \"I treasure life even when it's not planned, but I respect that the law puts this in the hands of voters, and I will respect their will. \u2026 [My] personal opinions? No, they don't have any role.\"",
      "Crawford, on her end, told WISN she has made no promises to any abortion access advocacy groups but said she is proud of the work she did as a lawyer \"fighting for people's rights,\" including when representing Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.",
      "Women Speak Out PAC, a group that is affiliated with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a group that opposes abortion access, launched canvassers and volunteers to get out the vote for Schimel. SBA has made a six-figure investment in the race.",
      "\"Lives are literally on the line in this race, and they depend upon Wisconsin voters showing up for Brad Schimel. \u2026 If Schimel doesn't win, the court will be a tool of the Left,\" Kelsey Pritchard, political communications director for SBA, told ABC News in an interview.",
      "EMILY's List, a political group that supports female candidates who support abortion access, has donated to Crawford and ran a digital fundraising campaign to encourage others to donate.",
      "\"As Trump, MAGA Republicans, and unelected billionaires like Elon Musk try to rip away the freedoms we've fought so hard for, electing Judge Susan Crawford to the Wisconsin state Supreme Court means protecting these rights that are under attack,\" EMILY's List President Jessica Mackler said in a statement to ABC News.",

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told food industry leaders in a closed-door meeting on Monday that he wants them to remove artificial color additives from their products by the end of his time in office, according to a memo describing the meeting, which was obtained by ABC News.",
      "At the Washington gathering, which included the CEOs of Kellogg's, Smucker's and General Mills, Kennedy said it is a top priority of the Trump administration to rid America's food of the artificial dyes, wrote Melissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group, who penned the memo.",
      "Hockstad addressed the memo to \"Consumer Brands Member CEOs.\"",
      "\"The Secretary made clear his intention to take action unless the industry is willing to be proactive with solutions,\" Hockstad wrote.",
      "Kennedy has long championed removing artificial coloring from America's food, and the effort has become a pillar of the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement.",
      "In January, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its authorization of one type of red food dye -- Red No. 3. The dye is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals but was allowed to be used by manufacturers for years because scientists didn't believe it raised cancer risk in humans at the level typically consumed.",
      "The FDA, under then-President Joe Biden, acted after longtime pressure by consumer advocates.",
      "But a different type, Red No. 40, remains on the market and hasn't been studied by the FDA in more than 20 years. FDA and health officials said there is no evidence though that it is harmful, and food manufacturers said they need to be able to rely on ingredients generally recognized as safe.",
      "In the memo, Hockstad said her association will work with HHS leaders about removing \"roadblocks\" so food companies can help meet Kennedy's goal.",
      "\"We will be working with your teams to gain as much alignment as possible about how we move forward and ensure the industry is positioned in the best possible way as we navigate next steps forward,\" she wrote. \"But to underscore, decision time is imminent.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Consumer Brands Association confirmed the authenticity of the letter, which was first reported by Bloomberg, but did not provide further comment.",

      "The order mandates that lawyers working for the firm have clearances stripped.",
      "The law firm Perkins Coie has filed suit against the Trump administration over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump last week that targeted the firm for its work representing Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.",
      "Attorneys representing Perkins Coie filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, along with a request for a temporary restraining order to bar enforcement of the executive order.",
      "\"The Order is an affront to the Constitution and our adversarial system of justice,\" the lawsuit said. \"Its plain purpose is to bully those who advocate points of view that the President perceives as adverse to the views of his Administration, whether those views are presented on behalf of paying or pro bono clients.\"",
      "It's the first legal challenge in what Trump has previewed will be a wave of executive actions seeking to punish law firms that have represented his perceived political enemies.",
      "The order, signed by Trump on March 6, mandates that lawyers working for Perkins Coie have their security clearances stripped and aims to terminate any government contracts that might exist with the firm or other entities that it represents. It further bars agencies from hiring employees of Perkins Coie and prohibits employees from the firm from accessing government buildings.",
      "\"Perkins Coie brings this case reluctantly,\" the lawsuit said. \"The firm is comprised of lawyers who advocate for clients; its attorneys and employees are not activists or partisans. But Perkins Coie\u2019s ability to represent the interests of its clients -- and its ability to operate as a legal-services business at all -- are under direct and imminent threat. Perkins Coie cannot allow its clients to be bullied.\"",
      "In his signing of the order, Trump pointed to Perkins Coie's work in the 2016 campaign and ties to the \"Steele Dossier,\" which detailed a series of highly salacious allegations about Trump that were later investigated by the FBI and determined to be unsubstantiated.",
      "Marc Elias, who left Perkins Coie to start his own firm in 2021, brokered an agreement with the research and intelligence firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump leading up to the 2016 election. Fusion then hired a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who compiled the dossier.",
      "As Perkins Coie's lawsuit noted, however, the two attorneys singled out in the executive order's actual text \"have not been with the firm for years.\"",
      "\"The retaliatory aim of the Order is intentionally obvious to the general public and the press because the very goal is to chill future lawyers from representing particular clients,\" the lawsuit said.",

      "LANSING, Mich. -- Garlin Gilchrist II, a Democrat from Detroit who is Michigan's first Black lieutenant governor, announced he's jumping into the crowded 2026 race for governor on Tuesday.",
      "A software engineer by trade, Gilchrist vaulted from relative political obscurity in 2018 to run alongside Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and his profile has been bolstered over the past six years by working closely with one of the nation\u2019s most high-profile Democrats.",
      "\"When you have a problem, an engineer can fix that problem,\u201d Gilchrist said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of his announcement, saying he's built up relationships in each of the state's 83 counties. \u201cThat\u2019s a story that I\u2019m going to tell.\u201d",
      "As governor, he said he\u2019ll focus on expanding affordable housing and improving access to health care, particularly mental health services.",
      "He recognized that voters sent President Donald Trump back to the White House in part because of frustration with a \u201cstatus quo that wasn\u2019t serving them.\u201d Trump notched a 1.5-point victory in Michigan last fall.",
      "\u201cThat anger comes from not having results, from things not working,\u201d said Gilchrist. He described moving to Washington state to work for Microsoft after graduating from the University of Michigan, but says that as governor, he'll make sure residents can \"be their best self here.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want us to make good choices today so that the people of Michigan know that they can take their next step here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can build their careers and their families and their futures here.\u201d",
      "Still, Gilchrist will have to balance that narrative with his role near the top of the Democratic Party, which held full control of state government from 2022 to 2024. Gilchrist in his AP interview did not break from Whitmer, calling her an ally and said they have \u201claid a really good foundation for the future of the state of Michigan.\u201d",
      "Gilchrist is seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. His hometown Detroit is the state\u2019s largest Democratic stronghold and nearly 80% Black, bolstering his appeal. If elected, Gilchrist would be the first Black governor of the state. However, before joining Whitmer on the Democratic ticket, he ran for Detroit City Clerk in 2017 and narrowly lost to incumbent Janice Winfrey.",
      "Lieutenant governors also don't have a good track record in Michigan when trying to ascend to the governor's office, with the most recent example being Republican Brian Calley, who was trounced in the party's primary in 2018.",
      "Gilchrist joins Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the 2026 Democratic primary. Whitmer has said she won't endorse any candidate.",
      "The primary winner could face an uphill battle in the general election. Along with a Republican opponent \u2014 Republican Senate Leader Aric Nesbitt is seen as the leading candidate currently \u2014 they may also contend with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Democrat now running for governor as an independent.",

      "\"How could so much of the work force be amputated suddenly overnight? It's so irregular and so widespread and so aberrant from the history of our country,\" Judge Alsup said. \"How could that all happen with each agency deciding on its own to do something so aberrational?\"",
      "\"I don't believe it,\" said the judge. \"I believe they were directed or ordered to do so by OPM in that telephone call. That's the way the evidence points.\"",
      "The allegations about the mass firings comes as the Trump administration faces increased scrutiny about the role of the Department of Government Efficiency in reducing the size of the federal government. During a cabinet meeting last week, Trump told the heads of the federal agencies that they are in charge of making cuts to their own departments, rather than Elon Musk and DOGE.",

      "Detective Daniel Smith, the trial's first witness, said Mahdiyev was arrested in July 2022 when he ran a stop sign in Alinejad's neighborhood and was found to be driving despite a suspended driver's license. A search of his car turned up a loaded AK-47 assault rifle, Smith said.",
      "Defense attorneys for Amirov and Omarov told jurors in opening statements that their clients were not guilty and that prosecutors' evidence was merely circumstantial.",

      "Gutwillig said the government of Iran had long attacked Alinejad, smearing her reputation, imprisoning her brother and trying to kidnap her and bring her back to Iran in 2020. He said Iranian officials then agreed to the $500,000 assassination plot with the two men who wanted to make money and enhance their positions in their organized crime group.",
      "\u201cThe defendants were hired guns for the government of Iran,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cShe shared them with millions. She shined a light on the government of Iran's oppression of women, and that enraged the regime\u201d Gutwillig said."

      "The Associated Press has obtained a document showing that the Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing",
      "The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The action is part of a slew of cuts and funding freezes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, largely at the direction of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, that have rattled the affordable-housing industry.",
      "Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it's a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation's housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans.",
      "The program has already awarded the money to projects that would upgrade at least 25,000 affordable units across the country, and details of how it will be wound down remain unclear.",
      "A spokesperson for HUD did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But an internal document reviewed by the AP said that the program is being \u201cterminated\u201d at the direction of DOGE. Two HUD workers, who have knowledge of the program and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, confirmed the directive to shutter it.",
      "On it's face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing.",
      "But the money plays a much larger role in preserving affordable units.",
      "Projects that use the funds are required to keep their buildings affordable for up to 25 years. The money is also leveraged to pull in other investments for major repairs and renovations needed to keep the buildings livable.",
      "It's like building a Jenga tower, where one of the program's grants or loans \u2014 which range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 is a bottom block and each new block is another investment, experts said.",
      "This money \u201cwas essential in order for the project to come together,\u201d said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. \u201cProjects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.\u201d",
      "The news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options \u2014 most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year.",
      "The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it's first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments.",
      "The potential loss \u201cseriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\u201d said Greg Franks, president of the property\u2019s management company, adding that the work is \"needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are depending on that $10 million,\u201d he said.",
      "So, too, are Hase and Starr, a retired couple in their 70s who have lived there for 16 years.",
      "They fill their balcony with geraniums and petunias, count the eagles at a nearby park and live off of meager Social Security incomes. They learned about the potential funding loss in a letter from the apartment's management company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kinda terrifying, it\u2019s almost like getting news from a doctor that something's going to take your life in six months or a year,\u201d Hase told the AP in a phone call.",
      "\u201cWe're from an era where the wages weren't there, so our Social Security ...\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cSucks,\u201d pitched in Starr.",
      "\u201cIf I'd been born a rich man,\u201d he said. Starr added: \u201cWe\u2019re just regular people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we're the lucky ones because we've got two social securities coming in,\" she said.",
      "But being lucky ones still doesn't count for much in today's rental market. \u201cPrices keep going up, I've looked, and there's no way,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between living and not being able to live,\" he said.",
      "HUD's lack of communication about the program's future sent organizations in search of contingency plans, though roughly two dozen projects will still get funding, one HUD employee told the AP. The rest are in limbo.",
      "\u201cIf these funds aren\u2019t reinstated, we will certainly seek other funding to fill that gap. The reality is that will take time and will inevitably make the project more expensive,\u201d Travis Phillips of the Housing Development Center said of funding for Smith Tower.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump overstepped his constitutional authority in freezing almost all spending on U.S. humanitarian and development work abroad, a federal judge ruled, saying the administration could no longer simply sit on the tens of billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated for foreign aid.",
      "But Judge Amir H. Ali stopped short of ordering Trump officials to use the money to revive the thousands of contracts they have abruptly terminated for U.S. aid and development work around the world.",
      "Ali's ruling Monday evening came hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration had finished what has been a six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, cutting 83% of them. Rubio said he would move the remaining aid programs under the State Department.",
      "Rubio made his announcement in a post on X, in one of his few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at the State Department and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams.",
      "Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and \u201cour hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform\u201d in foreign aid.",
      "Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now \u201cofficially ending,\" with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated. Those programs \u201cspent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote. About 1,000 remaining contracts would now be administered by the State Department, he said.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.",
      "In his preliminary injunction Monday, Ali said Trump could not simply ignore most of what is roughly $60 billion in foreign assistance funding that was given to USAID and State by Congress, which under the U.S. Constitution has the authority to spend money.",
      "\u201cThe constitutional power over whether to spend foreign aid is not the President\u2019s own \u2014 and it is Congress\u2019s own,\u201d Ali wrote, adding elsewhere that Trump officials \u201coffer an unbridled view of Executive power that the Supreme Court has consistently rejected.\u201d",
      "But Ali declined the request from nonprofit groups and businesses to revive the canceled contracts for foreign assistance work around the world, saying it was up to the administration to make decisions on specific contracts. The mass contract cancellations also were a separate matter than the funding freeze that two global health groups, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, had originally gone to court to challenge, he said.",
      "Ali also ordered Trump officials to pay all of the roughly $2 billion it owed to aid groups and businesses up to mid-February, and ordered them to do it at a pace of at least 300 back payments a day.",
      "Despite claims from the administration it was continuing to fund at least life-saving programs in its foreign aid freeze, USAID staffers and the agency's nonprofit and business partners say all payments through USAID were cut off until recently, and that USAID's payment system itself disabled by Musk's DOGE.",
      "Ali's ruling came after the Supreme Court had rejected the Trump administration's appeal in the case.",

Bush.",

      "Measles outbreaks in West Texas and New Mexico now have more than 250 cases total",
      "Measles outbreaks in West Texas and New Mexico are now up to more than 250 cases, and two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "Here's what you need to know about measles in the U.S.",
      "Texas state health officials said Tuesday there were 25 new cases of measles since the end of last week, bringing Texas' total to 223. Twenty-nine people in Texas are hospitalized.",
      "New Mexico health officials announced Friday that there were 30 cases in Lea County, which neighbors the West Texas communities at the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "A school-age child died of measles in Texas last month, and New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult last week.",
      "Measles cases have been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases \u2014 and there have been three clusters that qualified as outbreaks in 2025.",
      "In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are generally traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",
      "Adults with \u201cpresumptive evidence of immunity\u201d generally don\u2019t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.",
      "A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don't always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary.",
      "Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.",
      "People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don\u2019t know which type they got.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "In communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called \u201cherd immunity.\u201d",
      "But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.",

      "TACOMA, Wash. -- A baby sea lion toting an artificial kelp strip was filmed performing intricate rhythmic gymnastics-esque circles through the waters of an aquarium in Washington state.",
      "Although only 9 months old and still reliant on her mother's milk, Pepper has become the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium's most acrobatic sea lion, said Noelle Tremonti, a staff biologist for the aquarium.",
      "\u201cWe always joke a little bit that she\u2019s acting as a ribbon dancer because it does look so artistic under the water and shockingly beautiful under the water as well,\" she said. \"But also just makes me really happy to see her interacting with enrichment in such a focused way.\u201d",
      "The dizzying circles performed in Tacoma, Washington, about 34 miles (55 kilometers) south of Seattle, last month are part of the sea lion\u2019s many enrichment activities. The strips help the pup learn how to interact with kelp, which it would be around a lot in its natural environment, and how to explore its environment using its mouth, said Tremonti.",
      "The strip, which is made out of heavy duty felt material, is just small enough for Pepper to grab and manipulate, said Tremonti. In the video, the sea lion pulls it with its flipper while chasing the tail end to create the graceful circles and later clamps down on the strip with its mouth.",
      "Pepper was the first sea lion born at the aquarium in its 120-year history. Now 74 pounds (33.5 kilograms), it recently ate its first fish, although it mostly just likes to play with them.",
      "But the playful and inquisitive sea lion's favorite activity is flipping around with kelp strips.",
      "\u201cShe will dedicate a good portion of her day to finding different things to do with the kelp strips,\u201d said Tremonti. \"It\u2019s really fun to watch.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court has weighed in twice on President Donald Trump\u2019s rapid-fire efforts to remake the federal government",
      "WASHINGTON -- In fewer than 500 carefully chosen and somewhat opaque words, the Supreme Court has now weighed in twice on President Donald Trump's rapid-fire efforts to remake the federal government.",
      "The justices did not give Trump's administration what it sought. The court rejected the Republican administration's position that it had the immediate power to fire the head of a watchdog office. In the other, the court slowed the effort to block the release of up to $2 billion in foreign aid.",
      "In the end, the short-term losses for the administration may mean little, and the court's actions arguably reflect less about whether Trump was right or wrong in either case.",
      "Instead, they may stand for an important, but less showy, commitment to regular order from the top of a judicial system that has emerged as a key check on Trump\u2019s power with the Republican-controlled Congress largely supportive or silent.",
      "Jack Goldsmith, a Justice Department official during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, said there may be benefits for the court in taking small steps and delaying, which \u201cbrought the court advantage by achieving emergency outcomes it wanted without having to tip its hand prematurely on the merits of the cases.\u201d",
      "Trump's unparalleled flex of presidential power seems destined for several dates at a Supreme Court that he helped shape with three appointees during his first term.",
      "But even a conservative majority that has a robust view of presidential power and granted him broad immunity from criminal prosecution might balk at some of what the president wants to do.",
      "His push to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally, for instance, would discard more than 100 years of practice and a relatively settled understanding of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States.\u201d",
      "Challenges to the citizenship order are among more than 100 lawsuits that have been filed, and lower-court judges have hit pause on the administration's plans more than 30 times.",
      "The Supreme Court's early forays have largely not been about the substance of what the president wants to do but about the procedures used by federal judges who have the first crack at evaluating the lawfulness of the administration's actions.",
      "Trump allies, most notably his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, have railed at judges slowing his agenda, threatening impeachment and launching personal attacks. The Federal Judges Association, the largest such organization, issued a rare public statement decrying \u201cirresponsible rhetoric shrouded in disinformation\u201d that could undermine public confidence in the judiciary.",
      "Though Trump has said he would obey the courts, Vice President JD Vance, Musk and others have suggested the administration could defy a court order, which would spark a constitutional crisis. Trump has vowed to appeal decisions he doesn't like, something his administration has done quickly in several cases even as some plaintiffs question whether the government is fully following judges' orders.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to me that they're playing pretty fast and loose,\u201d said Jeffrey Schmitt, a professor at the University of Dayton School of Law. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as blatantly disrespecting the courts and refusing to follow their orders. They also don\u2019t want to change their behavior.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is getting drawn into the fray in fits and starts. That could change soon, as more lawsuits reach a stage at which they can be appealed to the high court.",
      "\u201cIt strikes me that the court is trying to signal that the normal processes should take place,\u201d said Kent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor who is the main author of a letter signed by roughly 1,000 scholars contending that the nation already is in a constitutional crisis as a result of Trump's actions.",
      "A progressive group, Court Accountability, said the court's more recent order, in the foreign aid freeze case, may have been reported as a setback for the administration.",
      "\u201cBut a closer look at the majority\u2019s short order reveals that the Chief Justice actually gave Trump everything he wanted,\u201d the group wrote on its blog, explaining that additional delays only make it harder for people and groups hurt by the freeze to recover.",
      "Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, wrote on The Volokh Conspiracy blog that the high court has ducked urgent constitutional issues it should have decided about the extent of the president's power. Instead, he wrote, district judges \u201care now confident they can issue any order they wish against the executive branch, and the Supreme Court will not stop them. This is the judiciary run amok.\u201d",
      "But while they sparked online outrage in some quarters of the president's base, the events of the past few days could be seen as validation for the justices' cautious approach.",
      "On Feb. 21, a Supreme Court order temporarily kept Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, in his job despite efforts by Trump to fire him.",
      "In fact, the justices didn\u2019t rule either way on the administration\u2019s request to throw out an order in Dellinger's favor. The high court held the matter \u201cin abeyance,\u201d pending further proceedings in the lower court.",
      "On Thursday, Dellinger ended his legal fight after a federal appeals court ruled against him \u2014 but not before he stalled the firing of 5,000 federal workers slated for layoffs.",
      "The Supreme Court finally acted on the administration\u2019s request, hours after Dellinger dropped out, dismissing it as moot.",
      "The scale of the federal layoffs that the new administration wants to carry out could also put federal employment law in front of the high court. While experts say the justices appear inclined to allow the president more power to hire and fire agency heads, the outlook is less clear for civil service protections for other federal workers.",
      "In the foreign aid freeze case, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali narrowed his payment order to require the administration to immediately pay only those organizations that had originally filed the lawsuit.",
      "But with nearly a dozen lawsuits filed over moves to freeze federal funding abroad and at home so they can align spending with Trump's agenda, the fight over \u201cpower of the purse\u201d seems bound to return to the Supreme Court.",
      "The justices have played a limited role so far, but Trump's presidency is less than two months old.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A small U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses is expected in court on Tuesday to fight for control over its operations and existence.",
      "The U.S. African Development Foundation last week tried to keep staff from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from entering their offices in Washington. DOGE staff managed to gain entry after returning with U.S. Marshals.",
      "Ward Brehm, the president of USADF, last week sued the Trump administration, saying in a complaint that the attempted takeover was illegal and that neither President Donald Trump nor DOGE had the authority to shut down its operations or replace its board members and president.",
      "Hours later, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon in Washington temporarily barred the administration from replacing USADF's leadership. Leon will hear arguments Tuesday from government lawyers and attorney's representing Brehm about whether the Trump administration can remove the board members and appoint new ones.",
      "Trump last month in an executive order targeted USADF and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the federal government. The independent agency was created in 1980 by Congress and is controlled by board members, who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.",
      "A primary question in the case is whether the Trump administration has the legal authority to remove the independent board members. Presidents are restricted from firing these members without cause, thanks to a nearly 90-year-old Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey\u2019s Executer, which has been a backstop for advocates in court against the Trump administrations' firings. More recent Supreme Court decisions have expanded the president\u2019s removal power and legal experts say the high court's conservative majority may be inclined to overturn that precedent.",
      "In a filing on Monday, attorneys for the government claimed the Trump administration last month removed USADF's board members by emails from the White House. USDAF challenged that account, saying that just one board member, Brehm, received a removal email.",
      "The remaining board members made Brehm president on March 3. The previous USADF president resigned before the agency was targeted for elimination.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration have argued that USADF's board has, \u201cdone everything possible to avoid complying with the President\u2019s clear directives,\u201d and that \u201cthe President must be able to designate acting officials to fulfill his duty to enforce the laws.\u201d",
      "Congress in 2023 allocated $46 million to USADF to invest in relatively small agricultural projects and energy infrastructure projects among other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries. The agency employs around 50 people.",
      "In court filings, USADF describes staff from DOGE demanding access to their systems, which staff denied citing privacy and security requirements. They also said DOGE emailed USADF's staff last month announcing that Pete Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID who has overseen its dismantling, would chair USADF's board.",
      "Marocco and some of the same DOGE staff have succeeded in shuttering another independent agency, the Inter-American Foundation. On Feb. 28, a White House official told IAF staff that Marocco would chair the agency's board, according to a letter sent to Congress by Eddy Arriola, the chair of IAF's board.",
      "The same day, Marocco held an emergency board meeting outside of IAF's offices because he was not able to gain entry to the building. In notes entered into the Federal Register, Marocco said he designated himself the acting CEO and president of IAF, seemingly firing the sitting president.",
      "Since, IAF's grants and contracts have been cancelled and most of its 37 staff members have been laid off. In 2024, IAF oversaw almost $350 million in investments in Latin American and the Caribbean, with a little more than half of that coming from outside funds, meaning from countries or private funders.",

    "story": [
      "An advocacy group says it's time for states to stop requiring abortion providers to file reports for every abortion",
      "States should stop requiring health providers to file reports on every abortion because the information poses a risk to both them and their patients in the current political environment, a research group that advocates for abortion access says.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute says in a new recommendation that the benefit of mandated and detailed data collection is no longer worth the downsides: It could reveal personal information, be stigmatizing for patients and cumbersome for providers \u2014 or could be used in investigations.",
      "\u201cIt would be a mistake for anyone to assume now that the information a state could collect about abortion would not be used to harm people,\u201d said Kelly Baden, Guttmacher\u2019s vice president for public policy.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade nearly three years ago, it opened the door for states to ban most abortions. It also ignited policy battles over information collected about ending pregnancies.",
      "The possibility of reports being used in investigations has increased with the return of President Donald Trump and anti-abortion officials in key federal government jobs, Baden said.",
      "Most state health departments require medical providers to report data about each abortion, though without including patient names. Massachusetts and Illinois mandate that providers give the state only aggregated data.",
      "The states that collect the information, in turn, produce reports on abortion statistics and send their information to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a nationwide tally. Together, that information gives a picture of how often abortion takes place, when in the pregnancy the abortion occurs and the age of patients.",
      "Those reports provide the fullest government pictures of abortion nationally, but they come with a lag time of about two years and lack data from states that don't require the reports: California, the country's most-populous state, as well as Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey.",
      "Certain information that some states collect \u2014 such as the patient\u2019s marital status or ZIP code and the reason for the abortion \u2014 do not serve a meaningful research purpose and could stigmatize patients, says Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet. In conjunction with other data, these details could even be used to identify people who obtain abortions, he said.",
      "The same level of detail is not required to be reported to the state for other medical care, Maddow-Zimet added.",
      "\u201cThe real concern here is that it fits into a broader pattern of abortion exceptionalism,\u201d he said.",
      "But Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said rolling back reporting requirements can be detrimental: It could downplay the frequency of abortion complications, for instance, she said. Additionally, details such as the reason for the abortion could shape public policy if it reveals increases in sexual assault, she said.",
      "\u201cThe more information we have, the better it is for women,\u201d Tobias said.",
      "An Indiana anti-abortion group began using public records requests to obtain individual abortion reports from the state in 2022 and report on alleged violations by providers \u2014 including submitting the reports late.",
      "The state Health Department eventually declared that individual reports are not public records because a ban on most abortions means so few happen that the reports could be used to reveal who's obtaining them. Earlier this year, state Attorney General Todd Rokita settled a lawsuit from the group, Voices for Life, by mandating that reports \u2014 with some personal information redacted \u2014 be available to the public. But the documents are not being provided as litigation continues.",
      "Melanie Garcia Lyon, the Voices for Life executive director, said in an email that one doctor had his licensed suspended in part because of a violation that someone spotted in a terminated pregnancy report. \u201cAbortion reporting protects women,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Michigan has halted required reporting. Minnesota has removed some required information, such as the marital status, race and ethnicity of patients.",
      "Arizona's Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the legislature, is calling for that state to drop mandated reporting. A bill that would repeal the requirements hasn't advanced.",
      "Connie Fei Lu, a medical fellow in complex family planning at the University of Illinois Chicago, said the 2022 Illinois change to collect a tally of abortions rather than detail on each one can protect the privacy of patients, especially those who travel from other states for abortion.",
      "But she said the data collection policies need to be thoughtful.",
      "\u201cI completely understand the delicate balance in abortion data collection in an environment where that data can end up in the wrong hands,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a research perspective, from a scientific perspective, not having this data is not a good thing.\u201d",
      "While Guttmacher wants an end to mandatory abortion reports, it's not calling for states to get out of the abortion data-collection business entirely; the group says states could instead use voluntary approaches to gather information.",
      "Guttmacher and another abortion-rights group, the Society of Family Planning, have been surveying providers over the past few years. The groups' analyses rely in part on estimates, but they have been released much more quickly than government data and have become key resources for understanding the impact of state bans and restrictions since Roe was overturned."

      "When protests over the Israel-Hamas war took root on Columbia University\u2019s campus last spring, Mahmoud Khalil became a familiar, outspoken figure in a student movement that soon spread to other U.S. colleges",
      "NEW YORK -- When protests over the Israel-Hamas war took root on Columbia University's campus last spring, Mahmoud Khalil became a familiar, outspoken figure in a student movement that soon spread to other U.S. colleges.",
      "The international-affairs graduate student was a fixture in and around the protest encampment on Columbia's Manhattan campus, serving as a spokesperson and negotiator for demonstrators who deplored Israel's military campaign in Gaza and pressed the Ivy League school to cut financial ties with Israel and companies that supported the war.",
      "\u201cWe want to be visible,\u201d Khalil said last April.",
      "Now that visibility has helped make him the face of President Donald Trump's drive to punish what he calls antisemitic and \u201canti-American\u201d campus protests. In the first publicly known arrest of the crackdown, federal immigration agents took Khalil, a legal U.S. resident married to an American citizen, from his apartment Saturday and held him for potential deportation.",
      "To Trump and his administration, Khalil's arrest is an opening move in a campaign to rid the country of foreign students accused of helping to make American campuses intimidating territory for Jewish students. To civil rights advocates and Khalil's lawyers, his detention is an assault on free speech and an attempt to suppress pro-Palestinian views.",
      "And to some who have worked alongside the 30-year-old graduate student at the protests and elsewhere, his arrest is a startling takedown of someone with diplomatic experience that he brought to bear in the charged days of the demonstrations.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t meet a kinder or nicer person to work with. He\u2019s thoughtful. He\u2019s intelligent. He\u2019s conscientious,\" said former British diplomat Andrew Waller, a colleague of Khalil's from the U.K.\u2019s Beirut-based embassy for Syria.",
      "Khalil worked there from about 2018 to 2022, running a scholarship fund and supporting the U.K.\u2019s diplomatic engagement with Syria, Waller said, noting that the role required an extensive background check.",
      "He said the two spoke a few weeks ago, and Khalil was focused on becoming a father \u2014 his wife is pregnant \u2014 and on strife in Syria, where he was born and raised in a Palestinian family. Khalil also expressed concern that he might be targeted by the new Trump administration, Waller said.",
      "After finishing high school in Syria, Khalil was on track to study aviation engineering there, but his plans were upended by the country's civil war, he wrote in a 2017 essay for an international education charity. He recounted that he left for Beirut, got a job with an education nonprofit that helps Syrian children, and went to a Lebanese university.",
      "\u201cWhere would I be if, like countless other Syrian refugees before me, I could not get a scholarship, could not work, or worst of all, could not leave Syria in the depths of the ongoing war?\u201d he wondered in the essay.",
      "Khalil earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and decided to continue his studies at Columbia, according to an online bio for a 2020 international development conference where he was listed as a speaker.",
      "Then, last spring, protests over the war in Gaza erupted at Columbia, where demonstrators set up tents in the middle of campus and took over an administration building. A wave of similar demonstrations spread to some other colleges around the country.",
      "Khalil served as a prominent student mediator on behalf of pro-Palestinian activists and Muslim students concerned for their safety.",
      "But images of his maskless face at protests, along with his willingness to share his name with reporters, quickly made him a target among those who saw antisemitism in the demonstrations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an easy scapegoat for them to say, 'Look at this Palestinian who never wore a mask and was active in the school protests,\u201d Khalil told an Associated Press reporter in an interview last week.",
      "The Columbia Jewish Alumni Association, meanwhile, has called Khalil a \u201cringleader of the chaos\u201d on campus. A new Columbia disciplinary committee has investigated various allegations against Khalil, most recently whether he violated a university anti-harassment policy by calling a dean \u201cgenocidal.\"",
      "Khalil is now being held in a federal detention complex in Louisiana.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Khalil should be deported because he organized \u201cprotests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own college campus, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda.\u201d The U.S. government has designated Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, as a terrorist organization.",
      "Those who protested alongside Khalil dispute that account.",
      "\u201cIf someone distributed something at a protest that has nothing to do with the group, they attribute it to him for having his face at the action,\u201d said Maryan Alwan, a Columbia University senior.",
      "She described Khalil as mild-mannered and gifted at navigating internal disputes among student protesters. Outside of activism, she said he enjoyed cooking and playing drums in Columbia\u2019s Arab Music Ensemble.",
      "Columbia protest leaders have insisted they\u2019re anti-war, not antisemitic, and the demonstrations include some Jewish students and groups.",
      "Still, a Columbia task force on antisemitism found \u201cserious and pervasive\u201d problems with the climate on campus. The group said in a report that during the demonstrations, Jews and Israelis had been verbally abused, humiliated in classes and ostracized from student groups.",
      "Khalil finished his master's degree studies in December and has been scheduled to receive his degree in May, his lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Meanwhile, he and his wife are expecting their first child. She is eight months pregnant, according to his attorneys. While not giving her name, they released a statement in which she implored the public \u201cto see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband\u201d and father-to-be.",
      "\u201cI need your help to bring Mahmoud home, so he is here beside me, holding my hand in the delivery room,\" she wrote."

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Candidates in a race that will determine ideological control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court will square off Wednesday in their only scheduled debate before the April 1 election.",
      "The contest, which has caught the attention of presidential adviser Elon Musk, will be a litmus test early in President Donald Trump\u2019s term in a key presidential swing state. Control of the court is on the line as it faces cases over abortion and reproductive rights, the strength of public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries.",
      "The race pits Waukesha County Circuit Judge Brad Schimel, a former Republican attorney general, against Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, who is backed by Democrats and is running in her first statewide race.",
      "Here is a look at some of the key issues:",
      "Crawford is backed by Planned Parenthood and represented the group in a pair of abortion-related cases when she was an attorney in private practice. She supports abortion rights and has said the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong to overturn Roe v. Wade. Much of her campaign against Schimel has focused on his past opposition to abortion, including when he was attorney general.",
      "Schimel, who is supported by anti-abortion groups, has said he believes that an 1849 state law banning abortions is still \u201cvalid\u201d and that there is no right to an abortion under the state constitution. He was also criticized by Crawford and current justices on the court after he said the liberal majority was \u201d driven by their emotions \u201d on a pending abortion case.",
      "Both candidates have repeatedly said their personal views on abortion would not affect how they would rule.",
      "As an attorney, Crawford sued in an attempt to overturn the state\u2019s law that effectively ended collective bargaining for public workers. That law, known as Act 10, was the centerpiece of former Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s tenure and made Wisconsin the center of the national debate over union rights.",
      "A Dane County judge last year ruled that the bulk of the law was unconstitutional, and an appeal of that ruling is expected to come before the state Supreme Court.",
      "When Schimel was attorney general, he said he would defend Act 10 and opposed having its restrictions also applied to police and firefighter unions, which were exempt from the law.",
      "Crawford also sued to overturn the state\u2019s voter ID law, but lost. A measure on the April 1 ballot would enshrine that law in the state constitution \u2014 an attempt by Republicans to make it more difficult to undo.",
      "Whether Schimel did enough as attorney general to clear the state's backlog of untested sexual assault evidence has been a central attack from Crawford and her allies.",
      "Schimel took more than two years to test about 4,000 kits sitting unanalyzed on police department and hospital shelves. He has said that the state Justice Department needed time to inventory the kits and struggled to find private labs to test them because labs were overwhelmed with untested kits from other states.",
      "In 2014, the state Justice Department learned of about 6,800 sexual assault evidence kits that had not been tested. Wisconsin cleared its backlog of untested kits in 2019, the year after Schimel left office.",
      "Many of the television ads in the race have focused on specific cases Crawford and Schimel have handled as judges, with both sides claiming the other is weak on crime.",
      "Schimel previously worked as the Waukesha County district attorney and has racked up endorsements from law enforcement officials, including a majority of the state\u2019s county sheriffs, the Wisconsin Fraternal Order of Police and the Milwaukee Police Association.",
      "Crawford worked as a prosecutor for the attorney general\u2019s office under a Democrat and has the backing of the sheriffs of Milwaukee and Dane counties, as well as dozens of judges from around the state.",
      "The winner will determine whether the court remains under majority control of liberal justices as it has since 2023, or whether it will flip back to conservative control as it had been for 15 years prior to that.",
      "The race has become nationalized thanks to groups funded by Musk that have spent more than $8 million in support of Schimel. Crawford also has benefitted from donations from prominent national Democrats such as philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, but they haven\u2019t kept pace with Musk\u2019s spending.",
      "Donald Trump Jr. and political activist Charlie Kirk plan to co-host a town hall on Monday in Wisconsin that's being billed as a get-out-the vote effort for Schimel.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans will face a critical test of their unity when a spending bill that would avoid a partial government shutdown and keep federal agencies funded through September comes up for a vote.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is teeing up the bill for a vote as soon as Tuesday despite the lack of buy-in from Democrats, essentially daring them to oppose it and risk a shutdown that would begin Saturday if lawmakers fail to act.",
      "Republicans will need overwhelming support from their members in both chambers \u2014 and some help from Senate Democrats \u2014 to get the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. It's one of the biggest legislative tests so far of the Republican president's second term.",
      "\u201cThe CR will pass,\u201d Johnson told reporters Monday, using Washington shorthand to describe the continuing resolution. \u201cNo one wants to shut the government down. We are governing, doing the responsible thing as Republicans. It\u2019s going to be up to Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats to do the right thing.\"",
      "The strategy has the backing of Trump, who is calling on Republicans to \u201cremain UNITED \u2014 NO DISSENT \u2014 Fight for another day when the timing is right.\u201d",
      "House Republicans said the bill would trim $13 billion in non-defense spending from the levels in the 2024 budget year and increase defense spending by $6 billion, which are rather flat changes for both categories when compared with an overall topline of nearly $1.7 trillion in discretionary spending. The bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including Social Security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs is on auto pilot and not regularly reviewed by Congress.",
      "Democrats are mostly worried about the discretion the bill gives the Trump administration on spending decisions. They are already alarmed by the administration's efforts to make major cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, run by billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk. And they say the spending bill would fuel the effort.",
      "\u201cThis is not a clean CR. This bill is a blank check,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cIt's a blank check for Elon Musk and President Trump.\u201d",
      "Spending bills typically come with specific funding directives for key programs, but hundreds of those directives fall away under the legislation, according to a memo released by Senate Democrats. So the administration will have more leeway to reshape priorities.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has endorsed this full-year CR because he understands what is in it for him: more power over federal spending to pick winners and losers and devastate Democratic states and priorities,\u201d the memo warned.",
      "For example, the Democratic memo said the bill would allow the administration to steer money away from combating fentanyl and instead use it on mass deportation initiatives.",
      "Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That\u2019s because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own.",
      "This time, Republican leaders are pushing for a vote despite Democratic opposition. Trump is showing an ability this term to hold Republicans in line. He met with several of the House chamber's most conservative members last week.",
      "Now, House Republicans who routinely vote against spending bills said they would support this one. The House Freedom Caucus, which includes many of the House's most conservative members, issued a statement of support saying \u201ccontrary to Congress\u2019 longtime abuse of this legislative tool, this CR is a paradigm shift.\u201d",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is still a holdout, though. He says he'll vote no.",
      "\u201cI guess deficits only matter when we're in the minority,\u201d said Massie, when asked why colleagues weren't listening to his concerns.",
      "Trump went after Massie on social media, calling him a \u201cGRANDSTANDER, who\u2019s too much trouble.\u201d",
      "\"HE SHOULD BE PRIMARIED, and I will lead the charge against him,\" Trump posted online.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, acknowledged the continuing resolution was not the outcome he was seeking but said it was time to end the cycle of short-term extensions Congress has been passing to keep the government open. This will be the third for the current budget year.",
      "\u201cCongress does have other things to do,\" said Cole, of Oklahoma. \u201cIt's got a lot on its plate this year.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders have come out strongly against it. Less clear is how strongly they'll push members in competitive battleground districts to follow their lead.",
      "\u201cHouse Democrats will not be complicit in the Republican efforts to hurt the American people,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said.",
      "Senate Democrats generally seem to be emphasizing patience at this stage, waiting to see if Republicans can muscle the bill through the House before taking a stand.",
      "\u201cNo comment,\u201d said top Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York as he rushed through the hallway outside the Senate chamber.",
      "Still, several rank-and-file Democrats criticized the measure. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said he was stunned that Republicans were \u201ctrying to jam through something that is their way or the highway.\u201d",
      "If the bill does move to the Senate later this week, support from at least eight Democratic senators will likely be needed for it to advance to passage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be up to the Democrats whether they want to deliver the votes and keep the government from shutting down,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Democrats also introduced an alternative bill Monday night funding the government through April 11. The bill could serve as a Plan B if the GOP-led effort falters.",
      "The spending bill could also have major ramifications for the District of Columbia's government. City officials voiced their concerns during a news conference outside the Capitol on Monday, and district residents later in the day flooded the hearing room and surrounding hallway where lawmakers were considering debate rules for the measure.",
      "The bill would limit the district to last year's funding levels, though it's already spending at 2025 levels. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said the proposal would require the district to cut $1.1 billion in spending in the next six months since it has already passed a balanced budget and is midway through its fiscal year. That means, officials said, cuts to critical services such as education and public safety.",
      "The mayor also emphasized that the district's 2025 budget focused on boosting three priorities: public safety, public education and economic growth.",
      "\u201cIf the Congress goes through with this action, it will work against a priority that President Trump and I share, and that is to make Washington, D.C., the best, most beautiful city in the world,\u201d Bowser said.",

    "story": [
      "The district attorney of Los Angeles County says he does not support resentencing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The district attorney of Los Angeles says he does not support the resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez, brothers who have spent more than 30 years in prison for killing their parents at their Beverly Hills home in 1989.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Monday that the brothers have repeatedly lied about why they killed their parents and \u201cfell short\u201d of taking full responsibility for their crimes.",
      "The brothers have argued that they committed the crimes in self-defense after years of abuse by their father.",
      "Here are some things to know about the case:",
      "The shotgun killings of Jose and Kitty Menendez took place on Aug. 20, 1989, in their Beverly Hills mansion. Their son Lyle Menendez was the one who called 911, with the brothers initially claiming the killing was Mafia-related or connected to their father\u2019s business dealings.",
      "The brothers went on spending sprees, buying Rolex watches, cars and houses. Two months later, Erik Menendez told his psychologist, Jerome Oziel, that he and his brother killed their parents. They were eventually arrested and charged in their parents\u2019 deaths.",
      "The murder case captured the public\u2019s attention. Coming on the heels of the O.J. Simpson trial, the nation was hungry for true crime TV. The brothers\u2019 first trial was one of the first to be almost entirely televised on Court TV. It spawned documentaries, television specials and dramatizations. The Netflix drama \u201c Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story \u2033 and the documentary \u201cThe Menendez Brothers,\u201d released in the fall of 2024, have been credited for bringing new attention to the case.",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez's first trial took place in 1993 with separate juries. Prosecutors argued they killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers\u2019 attorneys never disputed the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "Both trials resulted in a hung jury on all three counts for the killing of Jose and Kitty Menendez, and the conspiracy to commit murder. The juries were split over murder and manslaughter convictions.",
      "At the second trial in 1995, the judge excluded a substantial amount of evidence presented in the first trial, including testimony from several family members who witnessed or heard about the abuse. Prosecutors doubled down on their claim that no abuse happened. A single jury convicted both brothers of three counts, including first-degree murder, plus lying in-wait and special circumstance allegations. They were sentenced to life without parole in 1996.",
      "In the years that followed, the brothers repeatedly appealed their convictions. In 1998, they were denied by an appellate court and the California Supreme Court. Their petitions for habeas corpus, a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained, were denied by the state Supreme Court.",
      "After exhausting their options in state court, they filed petitions in federal court, which were denied. They then appealed in 2005 to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied them again.",
      "Their attorney said after that appeal failed, they resigned themselves to spending the rest of their lives in prison.",
      "In 2015, the brothers heard about a letter written by Erik Menendez to his uncle Andy Cano that was mentioned in a Barbara Walters television special. When they asked their attorneys about it, the attorneys were unaware of the letter and realized it had not been introduced at either trial, making it effectively new evidence.",
      "This letter, attorneys say, corroborates the allegations that Erik was sexually abused by his father.",
      "Roy Rossello, a former member of the Latin pop group Menudo, recently came forward saying he was drugged and raped by Jose Menendez, the boys\u2019 father, when he was a teen in the 1980s. Menudo was signed under RCA Records, which Jose Menendez headed at the time.",
      "Rossello spoke about his abuse in the Peacock docuseries \u201cMenendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.\u201d He provided a signed declaration to the brothers\u2019 lawyers, the final piece of evidence needed for them to file a new petition for habeas corpus in May 2023 and ask for a reexamination of the case.",
      "The brothers have submitted a petition for habeas corpus asking the court to grant them a new trial in light of the new evidence presented.",
      "The court is also considering a motion for resentencing submitted by Hochman's predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, last October. Gasc\u00f3n said his office would recommend the brothers receive a new sentence of 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole immediately because they were under 26 years old at the time of the crimes. If the state parole board granted their release, California Gov. Gavin Newsom then has 150 days to review the parole board\u2019s decision.",
      "Finally, the brothers have asked Newsom to grant them clemency. Newsom has ordered the state parole board to evaluate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if released.",
      "Hochman says he opposes resentencing the Menendez brothers because of their \u201clack of full insight and lack of complete responsibility for their murders.\"",
      "On Monday, his office announced it was withdrawing the resentencing motion submitted by Gasc\u00f3n's office. Hochman also said in February he does not support the brothers\u2019 habeas corpus petition for a new trial.",
      "Hochman said the brothers failed to \u201ccome clean\u201d about lies they told as the case unfolded, including their original claim that they did not kill their parents. He said their repeated argument that they shot their parents in self-defense does not match the facts of the case that show their premeditated steps to plan the killings and make it look like a gang hit.",
      "He also said the brothers did not admit they tried to get friends to commit perjury for them and lied about their mother trying to poison their whole family.",
      "Hochman's opposition to resentencing considerably reduces the Menendez brothers' chances at freedom, according to Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cFrankly it\u2019s the details that are set forth in this lengthy response,\u201d Levenson said, referring to the 88-page document released by his office. \u201cUp to now, it\u2019s pretty much been the defense\u2019s view of the facts for the court\u2019s consumption and the public as well.\u201d",
      "LA's previous district attorney, Gasc\u00f3n, supported resentencing, pointing to the brothers\u2019 rehabilitation in prison and saying the trial would have been treated differently with today\u2019s understanding of how sexual and physical abuse affects children.",
      "When prosecutors support resentencing, there is \u201csomewhat of a presumption\u201d that the court will do it, Levenson. Without that support, there may even be jurisdictional issues over whether the court can proceed.",
      "The brothers' resentencing hearing is still set for March 20 and 21, presided over by LA County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic.",
      "\u201cTheir more likely avenue would be through the governor\u2019s office and clemency,\u201d Levenson said. \u201cThat frankly is because Judge Jesic is likely to pay very close attention to all the facts set forth in this opposition.\u201d"

      "Online court records show the center's founder and chief executive, Tamela Peterson is charged with second-degree murder. The other defendants are Gary Marken, 65, and Gary Mosteller, 64, charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter; and Aleta Moffitt, 60, charged with involuntary manslaughter and intentionally placing false medical information on a medical records chart.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas appeals court on Tuesday halted the execution of a man who has spent more than 30 years on death row and had been set to die by lethal injection this week over the killings of six girls and young women found buried in the desert near El Paso.",
      "It was the second scheduled execution in the U.S. halted on Tuesday after a federal judge stopped Louisiana\u2019s first death row execution using nitrogen gas, which was to take place next week.",
      "In Texas, the order was another reprieve for David Leonard Wood, who in 2009 was about 24 hours away from execution when it was halted over claims he is intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for execution.",
      "Those claims were later rejected by a judge and Wood, 67, had been set to die Thursday. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, issued a stay of execution after his latest appeal, which renewed his claims of innocence.",
      "The court put Wood's execution on pause \u201cuntil further order.\" It did not elaborate on the decision in a brief three-page order.",
      "Had Wood been executed this week, he would have spent 32 years and two months on Texas\u2019 death row, the longest time a Texas inmate has waited before being put to death.",
      "The 1987 murders remained unsolved for several years until authorities say Wood bragged to a cellmate that he was the so-called \u201cDesert Killer.\u201d The victims\u2019 bodies were found buried in shallow graves in the same desert area northeast of El Paso.",
      "Authorities said Wood gave rides to the victims and then drove them into the desert, where he sexually assaulted and killed them. The victims were Rosa Casio and Ivy Williams, both 23; Karen Baker, 21; Angelica Frausto, 17; Desiree Wheatley, 15; and Dawn Smith, 14.",
      "Two other girls and a young woman were also reported missing but were never found.",

      "On March 4, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles declined a request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty or grant him a 90-day reprieve.",
      "His lawyers have for years sought to have hundreds of pieces of evidence tested for DNA after testing in 2011 of bloodstains on the clothing Smith wore found a male DNA profile that was not Wood.

      "State attorneys general have a higher profile than in years past, thanks to lawsuits against the federal government and others, and few have been as active as Republican Andrew Bailey of Missouri",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- When Missouri's attorney general says he'll seize Chinese-owned assets to force China to pay a $24.5 billion award won by the state in a lawsuit over COVID-19, the threat might be more important than actually collecting any money.",
      "Similarly, when Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey sued Starbucks last month, alleging that the coffee shop chain with a white male CEO discriminated against white men in hiring, the point might have been less about winning in court than the fight itself. He's attacking the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that liberals have championed and his Democratic counterparts have supported.",
      "Over the past decade, state attorneys general have become increasingly visible for suing presidential administrations of the opposite political party and pursuing policy goals through warnings and public demand letters. They are not only their states' top law enforcement officials but now also chief advocates for a variety of causes \u2014 and few seem as busy at it as Bailey.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re suing everybody, why not China?\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, the editor-in-chief of the nonprofit Brookings Institution's Lawfare publication.",
      "For decades, attorneys general promised to fight crime by advocating tougher criminal sentences and defending convictions in serious cases while enforcing consumer protection laws and ousting the occasional errant local official.",
      "They still do, but lawsuits and threats of lawsuits over national issues now get far more attention. Attorneys general argue that they've been pushed into it by presidents and federal agency heads.",
      "North Dakota's Drew Wrigley, a Republican, said environmental rules pursued under President Joe Biden compelled agricultural and energy-producing states like his to ask courts to force the Democratic administration to \u201crespect appropriate constitutional and legal boundaries.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration routinely abused executive authority, and regularly exercised power that Congress did not give them,\" Wrigley said. \u201cOur court victories have been victories for the rule of law in this nation.\u201d",
      "The shift started in the 1990s, when 46 attorneys general banded together to sue tobacco companies. A settlement led to annual payments to states exceeding $165 billion as of 2024.",
      "\u201cThat was really what gave AGs the experience to realize that they could make a major difference on the national level, even if the executive branch and even if Congress didn\u2019t act,\" said Paul Nolette, a Marquette University political scientist.",
      "Later, with Democrat Barack Obama in the White House, Republican attorneys general filed legal challenges against his administration. Democratic AGs did the same during Republican President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "\u201cAs the United States has become much more polarized, that\u2019s been matched by the politicization of the attorney general\u2019s office,\u201d said Drury University political scientist Daniel Ponder.",
      "Critics deride such tactics as grandstanding, but attorneys general have incentives to pursue them.",
      "In 2022, Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro won the Pennsylvania governor's race after touting more than 20 legal challenges to Trump administration actions, and he was a leading contender for his party's 2024 vice presidential nomination.",
      "Kansas Republican Kris Kobach lost races for governor in 2018 and the U.S. Senate in 2020 but resurrected his political career in 2022 by winning the attorney general\u2019s race after promising to spend each breakfast thinking about potential lawsuits against the Biden administration.",
      "Bailey's two predecessors in Missouri, both Republicans, won U.S. Senate seats: Eric Schmitt in 2022 and Josh Hawley in 2018. Bailey\u2019s own headline-grabbing work helped him get an audience before Trump as a potential U.S. attorney general appointee, although ultimately he didn't get the job.",
      "He defended Missouri\u2019s lawsuit against China \u2014 filed by Schmitt, his predecessor, and inherited by Bailey \u2014 by pointing to the result, though Wittes and other experts believe it will be difficult to seize assets and collect money from China. Missouri claimed that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the pandemic, harming the state.",
      "\u201cThis historic victory is a significant first step in holding wrongdoers accountable,\" Bailey said.",
      "Of course, China is far from Missouri's only target.",
      "Bailey has threatened private gyms over bathroom policies, demanded that public schools ban drag shows and sued New York state, claiming that Trump's 2024 hush money criminal trial was \u201covert meddling\u201d in the election that limited Missouri voters' information.",
      "Bailey was in office less than three weeks in January 2023 when he joined a multistate lawsuit against the Biden administration over immigration policy, and the next day, he was challenging a policy allowing 401(k) managers to use environmental, social and governance principles in their investing. Missouri kept joining lawsuits against Biden's administration: four over immigration policy, three over efforts to forgive college student loan debt, two over environmental rules, two over gun safety initiatives and two over transgender rights measures.",
      "Even after Biden left the White House, Bailey wasn't done with him.",
      "In a Facebook post last week, Bailey called for the Trump administration to investigate Biden\u2019s mental fitness late in his term and whether it undercut the \u201clegality of executive orders, pardons, and all other actions issued in his name.\u201d",
      "Bailey's lawsuit against Starbucks came weeks after Trump ordered an end to the federal government's DEI programs.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the company's DEI programs are pretexts for quotas limiting the number of white, male employees, resulting in a \u201cmore female and less white\u201d workforce since 2020, when CEO Brian Niccol, who is white, took over. Bailey argues that Starbucks practices, including actions against managers who don't meet DEI goals, violate state and federal laws against making employment decisions based on race or sex.",
      "\u201cI have a responsibility to protect Missourians from a company that actively engages in systemic race and sex discrimination,\u201d Bailey said.",
      "Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment and has until April 7 to file its response to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cEven if these suits are ultimately unsuccessful, they can have other effects in terms of changing behavior on the part of the defendants, in some cases delaying policy for a long time,\u201d Marquette's Nolette said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It\u2019s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top.",
      "The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,\" retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week.",
      "For Trump, it\u2019s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft.",
      "It's not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump's actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe.",
      "He's shaping a foreign policy that's more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren't meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance.",
      "Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world.",
      "The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what's-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe.",
      "Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump's \u201cledger\u201d approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy.",
      "Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, \u201cWinning isn't everything. It's the only thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,\u201d Frantz said. \"Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.\u201d",

He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment.",
      "Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America's oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks.",
      "In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has \u201cthe cards\u201d and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was \u201cregrettable.\" He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. \u2014 even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians \u2014 that Trump wants.",
      "In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy\u2019s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials.",
      "But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.\"",

      "Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations.",

      "Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion.",
      "Kellogg, who also served in Trump's first White House, recalled seeing Trump's \u201ctransactional diplomacy approach\u201d early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president's first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same.",

      "The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them.",
      "The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit.",

      "Now two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.",
      "He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.",
      "So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?",
      "Markets fall and recession risks rise",
      "In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.",
      "A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.",
      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.",
      "\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.",
      "The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.",
      "Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".",
      "\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.",
      "Tariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth",
      "For many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.",
      "Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.",
      "Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"",

      "Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.",
      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",
      "The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.",
      "\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.",
      "But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.",
      "\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway .. is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.",
      "Stock market in tech ripe for correction",
      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",
      "Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",
      "That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.",
      "Now, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.",
      "Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.",

      "On Monday, Ontario premier Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity and threatened to \"shut off\" supply completely.",
      "President Trump has said he is rebuilding wealth based on decades or even a century into the future, and this cannot be measured in the quarterly results of America's stock market giants.",
      "Alongside comments from his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the White House was communicating to markets that the president now has some tolerance for short-term market and economic pain. This has changed the calculus.",
      "There are another two factors at play here. There is evidence of actual potential reversal in the US economic sentiment, raising questions about a recession.",

      "In the past fortnight the world has learnt that President Trump is serious about tariffs, even on his allies. They have been applied in a huge way.",
      "Key trade partners have reciprocated in kind and have an incentive to up the ante. And the White House now wants to communicate it has a high pain threshold for short-term economic and market disruption.",

      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",

      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",

      "Trump blamed \"radical left lunatics\" boycotting the firm to \"attack and do harm\" to Tesla owner Elon Musk.",
      "However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will make a key decision which could unlock compensation for millions of motorists.",
    "story": [
      "An official compensation scheme is likely to be set up for people mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars, if widespread failings are found.",
      "The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it would set up a industry-wide redress scheme if it concluded mis-selling occurred.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open the ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "But the higher Supreme Court will soon hear an appeal against the decision.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "This would likely be done through a central scheme, which would be simpler for consumers than filing a legal complaint and would require firms to check if customers had lost out.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Lloyds Banking Group, for example, has put aside \u00a31.2bn.",
      "It's thought the total cost of compensation could reach \u00a325bn or more, according to analysts.",
      "Car loan scandal payout fears as row drags on",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator has extended the time providers have to consider complaints until December 2025, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",
      "The time period covers claims regarding leasing deals, as well as Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) agreements.",
      "The FCA also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision when it reconsiders the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, welcomed the extension.",
      "However, others have questioned whether it creates a further compensation delay for those who were mis-sold these agreements.",
      "In February, the Supreme Court rejected an unusual intervention from the government, which was worried huge amounts of redress payments could upset the car market and make it less competitive."

      "Platform monitor Downdetector says it had more than 1.6 million reports of problems with the social media site from users around the world on Monday.",
      "\"We're not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down the X system with IP [Internet Protocol] addresses originating in the Ukraine area,\" Musk said in an interview with the Fox Business channel.",
      "However, Ciaran Martin, professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government told the BBC that explanation was \"wholly unconvincing\" and \"pretty much garbage.\"",
      "Prof Martin - former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre - says it looks as if X was targeted by what's known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where hackers flood a server with internet traffic to prevent users from connecting to a website.",
      "\"It's not that sophisticated - it's a very old technique,\" Mr Martin told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"I can't think of a company of the size and standing internationally of X that's fallen over to a DDoS attack for a very long time,\" he added.",
      "He said the incident at X \"doesn't reflect well on their cyber security.\"",
      "Many users trying to access the platform and refresh feeds on its app and desktop site during Monday's outages were met with a loading icon.",
      "Musk, who has been a frequent critic of Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky, has offered no evidence to support his claim and did not say whether or not he thought state actors were involved.",
      "He posted on X that \"either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved\".",
      "But Prof Martin said tracing IP addresses \"tells you absolutely nothing,\" because hackers in this situation would hijack devices from all over the world.",
      "The BBC has approached the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC for comment.",
      "Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said its own metrics suggested the outages could well be linked to a cyber attack.",
      "\"What we've been seeing is consistent with what we've seen in past denial of service attacks, rather than a configuration or coding error in the platform,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said the organisation has seen several major outages spanning more than six hours on Monday, \"each having global impact\".",
      "\"This is amongst the longest X/Twitter outages we've tracked in terms of duration, and the pattern is consistent with a denial of service attack targeting X's infrastructure at scale,\" he added.",
      "Musk has previously claimed that the platform has been targeted by DDoS attacks, but these have not been confirmed.",
      "Like all major social networks, X is a regular target for disruptive and attention seeking attacks.",
      "But X has a track record of falling due to these attacks much more than other larger sites like Facebook and Instagram.",
      "In 2023, a small group of hackers called Anonymous Sudan took the site offline in more than a dozen countries for hours in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.",
      "Two men were arrested in 2024 for being the ringleaders of the group - showing that hackers can disrupt X with DDoS attacks from anywhere in the world with the right tools and expertise.",
      "Cyber specialists are seeing a \"sharp rise\" in DDoS attacks which are becoming \"an increasingly popular tool\" for criminals, according to Sian John, chief technology officer at cyber security company NCC Group.",

      "Published1 day ago",
      "Thames Water, the UK's biggest water company, is in financial crisis and has secured a rescue loan to avoid coming under government control.",
      "However, creditors have won the right to challenge the High Court's decision to allow \u00a33bn funding and their appeal begins on Tuesday.",
      "Even with the rescue deal, Thames still has huge debts and is struggling to fix leaks, sewage spills and modernise outdated infrastructure.",
      "Thames serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Without this latest financial lifeline, it had faced running out of money by the end of March.",
      "How did Thames end up with so much debt?",
      "Many UK water companies have large debts, but Thames Water's problems are the worst.",
      "Water companies were privatised in 1989, with the idea that private investment would improve the system.",
      "But critics say this hasn't happened - some companies have taken on too much debt and failed to invest in infrastructure.",
      "When Thames was privatised in 1989, it had no debt. But over the years it borrowed heavily and now has debts of about \u00a319bn.",
      "Its debt pile increased sharply when Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank, owned Thames Water, with debts reaching more than \u00a310bn by the time the company was sold in 2017.",
      "Macquarie said it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's water and sewage infrastructure while it owned the company, but critics argue that it took billions of pounds out of the company in loans and dividends.",
      "Will the rescue deal avert crisis for Thames?",
      "Thames says the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "However, that group of creditors is now appealing against the High Court's decision.",
      "If the funding deal had not been approved, Thames faced the possibility of a temporary nationalisation, under a measure known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "What will that mean for customers?",
      "Even if Thames Water had come under special administration, customers would have seen no impact on their services. Taps would still have run and toilets still have flushed.",
      "However, water bills in general are set to rise, with the rate at which they are due to increase set by the water regulator Ofwat.",
      "Ofwat, the water regulator, says that Thames Water can increase bills by up to 35% - excluding inflation - over the next five years.",
      "But the company says it needs a 53% rise to fix pipes and keep up with demand. It has appealed for permission to charge more.",
      "Customers are unhappy. Consumer groups argue people shouldn't have to pay more because the company has been badly run.",
      "But Sir Adrian Montague, Thames Water's chairman, has warned that without bigger price rises, the company cannot guarantee safe and resilient water supplies that can cope with climate change and population growth.",
      "Who owns Thames Water now?",

      "Why was Thames Water privatised?",
      "The entire water and waste sector was privatised 34 years ago under the late Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government for \u00a37.6bn. At the time, Mrs Thatcher wrote off the industry's \u00a35bn debt, leaving companies with a clean slate and gave them \u00a31.5bn in public money.",
      "The government had wanted to privatise the industry in 1984 but a public backlash against the plan saw it shelved until after the general election three years later. At the time, the UK was under pressure from Europe to improve the purity of its water.",
      "However, meeting European standards would cost billions of pounds worth of investment which, it was hoped, would come from the private sector and, by extension, companies' customers.",
      "\"If we want environmental improvement, it will cost money,\" said Mrs Thatcher in 1988. \"It will be the people who want those improvements in water who will have to pay.\"",
      "Former Labour MP Ann Taylor later said of privatising the water industry: \"The message is always the same - maximise the cost to the consumer to ensure maximum return to the investor. We should not be surprised at that. After all, that is what private investors expect of their companies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canada's most populous province Ontario is slapping a retaliatory 25% surcharge on electricity it sends to US states in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "Ontario leader Doug Ford confirmed the move in a news conference on Monday morning, saying it will increase costs for affected US customers by an average of $100 (\u00a377.65) per month.",
      "Roughly 1.5 million American homes and businesses in the northern border states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota will be impacted.",
      "Ford said that the surcharge on energy will remain until the threat of tariffs from the US \"is gone for good.\"",
      "\"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,\" Ford said in a statement on Monday.",
      "At Monday's news conference, Ford threatened to escalate further if the US increases their tariffs on Canada.",
      "\"I will not hesitate to increase this charge if necessary,\" he said. \"If the US escalates, I will not hesitate to shut off electricity completely.\"",
      "He added that he understands the tariffs are not the fault of the American people, blaming Trump solely for them. \"Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,\" Ford remarked, though he added: \"As premier, my number one job is to protect the people of Ontario.\"",
      "Ford said that Ontario will be using the revenue from its retaliatory tariffs on energy to support local workers and businesses impacted by US tariffs on Canada.",
      "Canada's federal government has also imposed its own dollar-for-dollar reciprocal tariffs on $30bn worth of US goods exported north. The list of products impacted ranges from clothing to perfume to orange juice.",
      "Trump responded to the surcharge in a social media post on Tuesday, saying \"your not even allowed to do that\".",
      "He said the US would \"get it all back\" with its own reciprocal tariffs in the coming weeks.",
      "\"Canada is a Tariff abuser, and always has been, but the United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has threatened Canada repeatedly with a blanket 25% tariff on all Canadian exports to the US - a move that economists have warned could result in job losses in Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "The US has threatened similar tariffs on neighbouring Mexico as well.",
      "Last week, Trump imposed the levies but quickly reversed course, saying he would temporarily spare carmakers from tariffs until 2 April.",
      "He later carved out further exemptions on goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) agreement, which Trump signed in his first term. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.",
      "Trump, however, is still expected to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium some time this week.",
      "Governors from states affected by the electricity tax also responded.",
      "Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul has commissioned a review of the impact of Trump's tariffs and Ford's response on energy prices and supply reliability in the state.",
      "\"These federal tariffs have been poorly conceived from the start: crafted in secret with no transparency and no clear economic rationale, they've only served to destabilize our capital markets and create uncertainty among New York families and businesses,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence.",
      "The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, has plunged to its lowest point since September, after Trump imposed the tariffs last week and later declined to rule out the possibility of a recession.",
      "In a Fox News interview that was taped on Thursday, Trump said \"I hate to predict things like that\" in response to the possibility of a severe economic downturn, after saying that the tariffs could bring about a \"period of transition.\"",
      "\"It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,\" Trump said."

This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.",

      "That's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. \"Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,\" Xi told party leaders last week.",
      "Ever since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has \"been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,\" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. \"In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.\"",
      "Behind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.",
      "The company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.",
      "\"Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,\" Mr Lyu insists.",
      "The success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and \"is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,\" he added.",
      "\"It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.\"",

      "The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.",
      "But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.",
      "That same fear \u2013 where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.",
      "Chinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that \"privacy was a red line\" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.",
      "\"DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,\" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that \"the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain\".",
      "But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.",
      "So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.",
      "So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.",
      "\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"",
      "This could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.",
      "Xi has repeatedly declared \"technological self-reliance\" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.",
      "The Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race \u2013 the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for \"AI triumphalism\" because China was still in \"catch-up mode\".",

      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 08:57:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The incoming Canadian PM has made standing up to his US counterpart a big part of his campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the \"anti-Trump\" on the US president's doorstep.",
      "The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought \"dark days\" from \"a country we can no longer trust\" and that he was \"proud\" of Canadians resisting the US \"with their wallets\".",
      "While on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs \"until Americans show us respect\", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. \"The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country\u2026 Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",
      "Behind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused \"entirely\" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and \"perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back\".",

      "Canada's next PM Mark Carney vows to win trade war with Trump",
      "Carney talks tough on Trump threat - but can he reset relations?",
      "How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister",
      "He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over.",
      "Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic.",
      "He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund.",
      "Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said \"good luck with that\". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's \"southern neighbour\".",
      "The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June.",
      "His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.",
      "On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards \"more reliable\" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US.",
      "The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can \"stand on its own feet\" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration.",
      "Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era."

      "Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken.",
      "The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, \"waging war on Lazarus\".",
      "ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible.",
      "All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group.",

      "But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money.",
      "\"North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,\" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said.",

      "Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out.",
      "More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange.",

      "He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency.",

    "summary": "An unexpected nationwide strike by airport workers over pay has caused disruption at major transport hubs.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Germany as airport workers stage a nationwide strike over pay, posing a major disruption for air travellers.",
      "The industrial action, led by the trade union Verdi, began unexpectedly on Sunday at Hamburg Airport, before expanding to a nationwide strike.",
      "Passengers at Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin and other major hubs have been urged not to travel to airports, with operations severely disrupted. Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.",
      "Verdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions.",
      "German media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.",
      "The Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.",
      "Meanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.",
      "Katja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.",
      "She said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".",
      "A spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer.",
      "Lars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"",
      "Many of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.",
      "Hundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin.",
      "Many passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR.",
      "ADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".",
      "Verdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members.",
      "Stubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.",
      "\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added.",
      "\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"",
      "BDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"",
      "It called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.",
      "Ralph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".",
      "He called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure.",
      "The so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.",
      "Verdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.",
      "Pay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.",
      "Niklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.",
      "\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added."

      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",

      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",

      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",

      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",

      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations.",
      "Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month.",
      "In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year.",
      "However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans.",
      "The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.",
      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\"",
      "Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.",
      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.",
      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",
      "Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.",
      "\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"",
      "But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.",
      "\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.",
      "\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The controversial cafe chain is expanding outside London but locals often have mixed feelings.",
    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

      "I'm standing in what feels like a suite in a posh hotel - all soft lighting, marble counter tops, plush seating and parquet-style flooring.",
      "An ornate platter of food catches the corner of my eye.",
      "\"That is a seafood tower as a welcome food amenity, as well as caviar, and you can also see the champagne there for guests to enjoy,\" says Dana Pouwels, head of airport lounge benefits at US bank Chase.",
      "She is showing me around Chase's new Sapphire Lounge at New York's La Guardia Airport.",
      "This is what waiting to catch a flight can look like these days \u2013 if you can afford to pay $550 (\u00a3433) a year to have the correct credit card required to gain entry.",
      "Then once inside Chase's new La Guardia lounge you can then choose to pay up to $3,000 to access a private suite for a few hours.",
      "BBC Business Daily: the battle of the VIP lounges",
      "It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of \u2013 they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges.",
      "And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap.",
      "\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.",
      "\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"",
      "Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access.",
      "But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too.",
      "JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business.",
      "For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars.",
      "It's designed for Centurion card holders \u2013 a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one.",
      "\"We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,\" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express.",
      "The card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop.",
      "Capital One have Capital One Caf\u00e9s - now you have a barista in a bank.",
      "Their branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine.",
      "The only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs.",
      "Anyone can use the caf\u00e9, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew.",
      "\"We're creating a showroom for our products,\" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes.",
      "\"For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for.\"",
      "None of this sounds like the sort of language you hear normally hear from financial institutions.",
      "Dan Bennett is the head of behavioural science the ad giant Ogilvy. He says this is all about brands tapping into how people think about themselves, and other people.",
      "\"Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,\" he says. \"It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated.",
      "\"The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that.",
      "\"And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens.\"",
      "But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.",
      "He points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee.",
      "Prof Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards.",
      "\"We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,\" he explains.",
      "\"If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost.\"",

    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.",

      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",

      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",

      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",

      "Ten years ago, Sir Terry Pratchett died aged 66, eight years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. His friend and lifelong agent Colin Smythe recalls his memories of the renowned fantasy author.",
      "A 20-year-old Terry Pratchett first walked into the office of the man who would become his first publisher and his agent in 1968.",
      "Colin Smythe had just published a book about education and Sir Terry had been sent by the Bucks Free Press to write up a story about it.",
      "Sir Terry mentioned that he would rather be an author than a journalist and the link-up began.",
      "Mr Smythe went on to publish the Beaconsfield-born writer's first five books, before becoming his agent. He retained that role until Sir Terry's death on 12 March 2015.",
      "When asked why Sir Terry enjoyed working with him, he recalled: \"Terry would tell me: 'You are the person I distrust the least in the publishing business'.\"",
      "\"The trouble is I was spoilt. I was exceptionally lucky that I was the individual he distrusted least,\" said Mr Smythe, now 83.",
      "Sir Terry first showed Mr Smythe his fiction work in the summer of 1968 and the publisher was immediately struck by his \"brilliance, sense of humour and his skill at writing\".",
      "\"At that time publishers were much more prepared to back their hunches,\" he said.",
      "\"This is a person who I did not want to allow to go some place else.\"",
      "The first book the pair worked on together was The Carpet People, which released in 1971.",
      "In 1986, after publishing the second Discworld story, The Light Fantastic, the friends agreed Sir Terry would need a bigger publisher and Mr Smythe would instead act as his agent.",
      "The Buckinghamshire-based publisher used his contacts to secure Sir Terry a deal at Victor Gollancz Ltd, which was known for science fiction and fantasy titles.",

      "That left Sir Terry to focus on his passion of writing.",
      "\"He didn't write as often as I would like. He would tend to write during winter evenings. In the summer evenings he preferred gardening,\" he said.",
      "\"He could write fast. He always worked on the idea that he would do at least 400 words a day. As it evolved he might do more, maybe 400 words before breakfast.\"",
      "Mr Smythe admitted he was occasionally chastised for making deals worth \"too much money\".",
      "He said: \"On one occasion... two publishers competed. Each came up with one price and I rang up Terry and said: 'They have offered me \u00a3750,000'.",
      "\"He said: 'This is mad, there is far too much testosterone going on around here'.",
      "\"He used to say: 'Truth be told, I shall tell them I would pay to be allowed to write.'",
      "\"I thought it was best not to tell that to the publishers.\"",
      "Sir Terry died after being diagnosed with a rare form of early onset Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"It affected his motor abilities rather than his cognitive abilities,\" said Mr Smythe.",
      "\"While he thought he was going to die within a few years, he went on with enough time to write another six best-sellers.\"",
      "Mr Smythe said 10 years after the death of his friend, he still misses \"the pleasure of his company\".",
      "He said: \"He was humorous, interesting, wide-ranging - all sorts of things.",
      "\"On one or two occasions I'd get a phone call on a Saturday: 'I'm stuck, I'm not sure where I go from here'.",
      "\"He'd tell me a layout of how far he'd got and you'd talk to him and he'd say: 'Oh, now I know where I'm going'. And he'd hang up.\"",

      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "The researchers studied the cases of 21 two-to-seven-year-olds in the UK and Ireland who needed emergency treatment soon after drinking a slushy product.",
      "The brightly coloured drinks are designed to appeal to children - but most contain the naturally occurring sweetener glycerol, instead of sugar, to stop them freezing solid and give the slushy effect.",
      "Current Food Standards Agency (FSA) advice says under-fives should avoid the drinks and under-11s should have no more than one.",

      "There could be a \"milder cohort\" who may not need hospital treatment but still suffer symptoms such as \"nausea and vomiting\", she added.",
      "The paediatricians behind the study - all working in the UK and Ireland - say it's difficult for parents to work out how much glycerol is contained in slushy ice drinks.",
      "Recommendations based on a child's weight are hard for parents to interpret, they say, and how quickly a slushy is drunk and whether it's taken with a meal or after exercise can also be factors in the side-effects experienced.",
      "\"Estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy,\" the researchers say, who recommend changing the advice based on a child's age instead.",
      "Dr Sally Anne Wilson, chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's safer care committee, told BBC Breakfast: \"As a parent you want to make sensible decisions for what you buy your child and if you're not aware that there's glycerol in the slushie and what that can do, then you're not going to have any qualms about buying the said slushie.\"",
      "Dr Wilson said age-based advice on the drinks is difficult because there's a variation in children's weight, but added \"there's definitely an argument\" for increasing the minimum age because it would solve that problem.",
      "One reason for the recent rise in children becoming ill may be the lower sugar content of the slushies, which is attractive to parents, the study says.",
      "In countries with no sugar tax, they contain much more glucose and often no glycerol at all, the authors say.",

      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",

      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",

      "Subtle genetic differences not linked to a high risk of blood cancer were present in more of the frequent-donor group - but because healthier people tend to give blood, this skews the picture.",

      "Everyday things",
      "The research, published in the journal Blood, was conducted with scientists in Heidelberg and with the help of the German Red Cross blood donation centre.",

      "And the research team now plans to analyse the blood of much larger numbers of people, including women.",
      "The current findings are a reminder that little everyday things - how people's environment changes - as well as their age, affects their tissues and blood, changing the stem cells, Dr Encabo said.",
      "'Healthy-donor effect'",
      "NHS Blood and Transplant said the research was \"interesting\" but further work was needed, because healthier people were more likely to donate.",
      "\"The 'healthy-donor effect' makes it difficult to study donor health generally,\" medical director Dr Lise Estcourt said.",

      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",

      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",

      "Former footballer Dean Windass says he is scared for the future following his stage two dementia diagnosis and wants more support for other players and their families in the same position.",
      "The 55-year-old, who played for 12 clubs during a professional career spanning 19 years, was diagnosed last year and the news was announced in January.",
      "Windass told BBC Newsnight he was trying not to let the illness affect him, but \"has a cry every now and then\".",
      "\"It scares me,\" he admitted. \"I don't know what the outcome's going to be. Interview me in 10 years' time and I might tell you a different story.\"",
      "Stage two dementia is an early phase of the syndrome in which people exhibit very mild cognitive decline, possibly including some memory lapses.",
      "Windass said it was \"emotional\" for him when he underwent tests and although he doesn't know what the future holds, said he was trying to live as normal a life as possible.",
      "He added: \"There's nothing I can do. You can't roll back the years, so you've just got to deal with it as much as you can.",
      "\"Hopefully, in the next five or 10 years it doesn't develop. It might do, but it might not. So, you get up in the morning and you live. You try to live your life as normal.\"",

      "In his first broadcast interview since the diagnosis, Windass spoke candidly about the impact the news was having on his mental health and his family.",
      "He said he believed his diagnosis was a direct result of repeatedly heading the ball, and had concerns for his two sons, Josh and Jordan, both of whom are footballers.",
      "\"I don't want them to worry because at the minute I'm alright,\" he explained.",
      "A study by Glasgow University in 2019 found former professional footballers were almost three-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than the general population.",
      "Windass said he wanted to raise awareness of dementia and get players' union the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to increase its support to affected players and their families.",
      "\"The one thing I love about myself is trying to help as many people as I can in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",
      "\"The reason why we've done this [interview] is to help the families, because my family might need help in 10 or 15 years' time. So I don't want them to suffer as well.",
      "\"At this present time, if I can help or we can help people and push the PFA to help these people ... that's what we're trying to do and trying to achieve.\"",
      "The PFA said it invested more than \u00a31m in a brain health fund after a group of 30 former footballers and their families launched legal action in 2022 against football's governing bodies, claiming they failed to protect them from brain injuries.",
      "The Premier League has also contributed to the fund, which according to the PFA, aims to provide industry-wide support to players living with dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions.",
      "Reassurances over future",
      "Windass is part of the Football Families for Justice (FFJ) group, which is a voluntary organisation dedicated to championing the rights and well-being of former players with neuro-degenerative diseases.",
      "Also part of the group is former Manchester United and Blackburn defender David May, who announced the news of Windass's diagnosis.",
      "He has said he is hoping that by speaking about it, Windass can help others in the future.",
      "May said: \"When I asked Deano if I could mention it, I didn't think it'd go as viral as what it has done.",
      "\"And in a way, it's an absolute blessing because other people can benefit from Deano coming out and speaking about it.",
      "\"He's talking about 10 or 15 years from now, he wants some reassurances that in 10 or 15 years' time those plans are being put in place, so he doesn't have to rely on his family and that there will be carers to help him.\"",

It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.",

      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.",
      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",
      "\"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.",
      "If you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic."

    "story": [
      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",
      "The 'Time Lords' racing to tackle the threat of GPS jamming",
      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.",
      "Changes likely to be announced in the coming days include restrictions on eligibility for the Personal Independent Payment, which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit.",
      "There is unease over the plans within the party, with Labour MP Rachael Maskell warning against \"draconian cuts\" that risk \"pushing disabled people into poverty\".",
      "Maskell told the BBC she had picked up \"deep, deep concern\" among Labour MPs.",
      "She said: \"I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people.\"",

      "Labour MP Diane Abbott said she would have liked to query the impact of the prime minister's proposed cuts to welfare but was told the meeting was full.",
      "In a letter to Reeves, a dozen charities have argued there is \"little evidence to suggest cutting benefits increases employment outcomes\".",
      "The charities - including Disability Rights UK, Citizens Advice, Scope and Sense - urged her to \"think again about cuts to disability benefits\".",
      "They said: \"There are disabled people out of work who want to work given the right support. And for some disabled people, work isn't appropriate.",

    "summary": "The measure is part of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced to Parliament.",
    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",
      "Up to \u00a32,500 off energy bills for people living within 500m of new pylonsStreamlining the process for approving key projects like wind farms, roads or railways and banning multiple \"meritless\" legal challenges.Allowing \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served process\" which the government says has clogged up the system",

      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",
      "\"We can't have nonsensical approaches that mean people's houses can't be built because of a stray cricket ball,\" Rayner said, adding: \"We need to have a common sense approach.\"",

      "Labour MP Sarah Owen, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, has been calling for this right to be extended in cases where miscarriages take place before 24 weeks.",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons, Madders said: \"Bereavement is not an illness, it's not a holiday and it does need its own special category.\"",
      "He added: \"I am grateful to the work of the Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.",
      "\"The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult personal experience and the inquiry they conducted demonstrated a clear gap in support for those who experience pregnancy loss and need time to recover and grieve.\"",
      "He said Owen had shown \"great bravery\" in speaking about her own experience of having a miscarriage.",
      "In 2021, Owen told MPs that after her own miscarriage she felt physically better in a few days but had \"all the classic signs\" of grieving.",
      "\"I could not eat, I could not sleep. I really did not hold much hope that life would ever get brighter,\" she said.",
      "Owen and her committee have proposed changes to the Employment Rights Bill which would ensure parents bereaved as a result of a pregnancy loss are entitled to two weeks of leave.",
      "During a debate on the bill on Tuesday, Madders said: \"We fully accept the principle of bereavement leave for pregnancy loss, as raised in the amendments, and we look forward to further discussions with [Owen] and [peers] as the Bill moves on to its next stages in the Lords.\"",
      "Owen said she was \"so pleased\" to hear the minister's commitment.",
      "Introducing a legal right to miscarriage bereavement leave would be \"a leading light in a world which seems to be taking a backward step in women's rights,\" she added.",
      "Vicki Robinson, CEO of the Miscarriage Association, said: \"We are extremely pleased to see, that for the first time ever, those experiencing pre-24-week pregnancy loss will be officially recognised in bereavement leave legislation.",
      "\"While we had been seeking paid leave, and the present commitment appears to be for unpaid leave, it nevertheless represents a significant step forward and provides long-overdue validation that this type of loss can be experienced as a bereavement like any other.\"",
      "Paid leave for bereaved parents is 'crucial'",
      "'I went back after 3 days': Calls for miscarriage bereavement leave",
      "How will the changes to workers' rights  affect you?",
      "The bill aims to strengthen workers' rights in areas including unfair dismissals, flexible working and sick pay.",
      "Opening the debate, Madders said it was a \"landmark bill\" that would \"tackle low pay, poor working conditions and poor job security\".",
      "Greg Smith, the Conservative shadow business minister, said he backed the government on bereavement leave for pregnancy loss but added that in the \"vast majority\" of the bill the government had got the balance between the rights employees and employers \"wrong\".",

      "\"But they are frequently misused in order to bully people into silence when they have already suffered at work.\"",

      "Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, is trying to amend the bill to provide greater protections for paternity or parental partner leave.",
      "The bill currently gives workers the right to paternity leave from day one of their employment, instead of the current 26 weeks.",
      "Creasy's amendment would compel the government to review and consult on the period of protected paternity and parental partner leave, which currently stands at two weeks.",
      "She said that was not long enough, adding that the UK had \"the worst\" paternity leave entitlement in the whole of the EU.",
      "Madders said the government would be holding a review of the parental leave system, which would be separate from the bill.",

      "As part of his suspended sentence, Amesbury must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, undertake an alcohol monitoring programme, go on an anger management course and carry out 20 days of rehabilitation work.",

    "summary": "Former cabinet minister says it would be ludicrous to suggest he tried to shortcut safety checks in the pandemic.",
    "story": [
      "Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks.",
      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",
      "\"Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the \u00a320m the company spent on the project \u2013 rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives.\""

    "story": [
      "The body advising judges on criminal sentences has hit back at the justice secretary's call for it to scrap new guidance on sentencing offenders from ethnic monitories.",
      "The Sentencing Council said ministers from both major parties or their representatives had known about the plans since 2022 and did not object.",
      "It comes after Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood last week wrote to the council urging it to rethink guidance directing judges to review the lives of offenders from ethnic minority and other backgrounds before deciding on a punishment.",
      "Opposition politicians had claimed the changes amounted to a \"two-tier justice\" system.",
      "Lord Justice William Davis, the chairman of the council, said that Mahmood's officials were fully briefed on the plans that had been three years in the making.",
      "He said that ministers could not \"dictate\" sentencing and he would have to take legal advice on Mahmood's powers over the council's work.",
      "This raises the bizarre possibility that the body advising judges on how to judge might decide to go to court for a ruling on whether the minister overseeing justice has any power to tell judges what to do.",
      "The row was triggered after the Sentencing Council, which advises judges and magistrates on the complexities of prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance for England and Wales on when a court should order a pre-sentence report into an offender's life.",
      "These reports do not tie the hands of judges but they often provide the court with a detailed insight into why an individual fell into crime, their risk of reoffending and the chances for rehabilitation outside of jail.",
      "The new guidelines told judges to order a pre-sentence report if the offender is from a minority background, facing the possibility of jail for the first time, a woman or pregnant.",
      "It also urged them to always consider a report in a wider range of circumstances, including where an offender has an addiction, is transgender, or has learning difficulties.",
      "Minister threatens law change after 'two-tier' row",
      "Call for ministers to overrule 'two-tier' sentencing changes",
      "More funding for judges to tackle record court delays",
      "Writing to the Sentencing Council last week, Mahmood said she objected to the new guideline, saying: \"As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law.\"",
      "That came after the shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick described the plan as \"two-tier\" justice that would disadvantage white offenders.",
      "But in a six-page letter to Mahmood, the Sentencing Council chair said the new guidance aimed to correct disparities and had been drawn up after long discussions over how particular types of offenders were being treated differently to others.",
      "Lord Justice Davis said that people from ethnic minorities were receiving longer sentences and the aim was to ensure that punishments were more consistent, regardless of background.",
      "He said Conservative and Labour ministers, as well as their their officials, had at least 15 opportunities over three years to object to the plan",
      "\"I have seen it suggested that the guideline instructs sentencers to impose a more lenient sentence on those from ethnic minorities than white offenders,\" he said. \"Plainly that suggestion is completely wrong.\"",
      "The senior judge said ministerial representative had been at all 15 meetings where the changes was discussed between July 2022 and January 2025.",
      "The public consultation on the plans had set out the proposals and Conservative ministers, then in power, had welcomed the \"fuller guidance\".",
      "\"No concern was expressed about the term now under debate,\" said Lord Justice Davis.",
      "Only eight of 150 responses to the public consultation had objected to the explicit reference to ethnic minorities.",
      "The judge said: \"At no stage did the Lord Chancellor's representative express any concern or reservation about the term now under debate.",
      "\"The walk-through of the guideline with officials from the Ministry of Justice took place on Monday 3 March. Again no concern was expressed about the relevant term.\"",
      "While ministers have an exceptional power to intervene in the Sentencing Council's decisions, this has never been used in a situation where new guidance had been published and the government had already been extensively consulted and had not objected.",
      "\"I shall have to take legal advice as to whether the power... applies in those circumstances,\" said the judge.",
      "He continued: \"I do not accept the premise of your objection to the relevant part of the list of cohorts for whom a pre-sentence report will normally be considered necessary.",
      "\"In criminal proceedings where the offender is the subject of prosecution by the state, the state should not determine the sentence imposed on an individual offender.",

      "There have also been allegations of bullying in Lowe's offices, which are being investigated by the lawyer hired by the party.",

      "On Sunday, the lawyer, a KC who has not been named by the party but whose credentials have been verified by the BBC, said: \"I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe MP and his constituency manager.",

      "'No credible evidence against me'",
      "On Friday, Lowe took issue with a statement issued by Reform, which set out that there would be an independent investigation into what had happened.",

      "\"Ever since this malicious attack on my reputation was launched, all I have asked for from both Reform and the KC is credible evidence against me. None has been provided. It still hasn't,\" he said.",
      "\"The KC has said she has been 'chasing' for that. I have received nothing. Because there is no credible evidence against me.\"",
      "He added: \"I have spoken with the KC at length, on the phone and through message. I've got to know her over the last week, and she has been very helpful, and is a charming lady who is trying to do her job in the very difficult position that Reform has put her in.\"",
      "'You have to stand up to bullies'",
      "He accused the party of an \"outright lie\" in claiming he had not co-operated with the investigation, a claim Reform made in a statement on Friday evening.",
      "\"I have been in discussions with my legal team this afternoon, and this will be followed by legal action in due course,\" Lowe told the BBC.",
      "\"I will not have my name dragged through the mud as part of a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage. You have to stand up to bullies, and I am doing exactly that.\"",
      "He said the lawyer had told him on Friday night: \"I advised that you should simply say that the party was precipitous to state that these allegations had been made without also saying that the party has commissioned an independent investigation and the investigation has not yet got underway to look at all the evidence and evaluate its veracity.\"",
      "Lowe's suspension came after the Daily Mail published an interview with Lowe where he said Reform under Nigel Farage's leadership remained a \"protest party led by the Messiah\".",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:52:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give more detail about the government's plans for the economy.",
    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares",
      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 14:26:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM seizes the spotlight as Trump upends the world order - but he faces serious challenges in the UK.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

    "summary": "President Macron has aired the idea that France's deterrence force could be used to defend of other European countries.",
    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

      "The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.",

      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",

      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",

      "What might be on board?",

      "It was not clear on the status of all the containers but Crowley said one had \"ruptured\" and was leaking fuel into the sea.",

      "It remains unclear if the ship was carrying other contents at the time of the crash.",

      "Jet fuel is a toxic substance that can be lethal to marine organisms and other animals like seabirds if ingested.",
      "The level of toxicity is dependent on the crude oil that it has been refined from.",
      "Sodium cyanide, which is used in industry including for metal cleaning, is a also a toxic substance and poisonous for living organisms as it disrupts cell function and leads to oxygen starvation.",
      "Sodium cyanide is also highly soluble in water and it can react vigorously to produce the gas hydrogen cyanide - which is also toxic.",
      "The confirmation that it was only empty containers on board will allay some concerns about environmental damage and make the clean-up operation easier.",
      "The third consideration for authorities will be whether the fuel used to run both ships - the bunker fuel - has also leaked out.",

      "\"The environmental toll could be severe,\" he said.",

      "What mitigation can be taken?",
      "The Marine Accident Investigation Branch is overseeing the operation to respond to the incident and clean up any pollution.",
      "Melanie Onn, the MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is currently doing an evaluation of the contamination risk and working with the owners of both of the vessels to plan a salvage operation.",
      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",

      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar.

      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",

      "It was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.",
      "Intuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.",

      "Last year Intuitive Machines' first spacecraft also landed on its side, breaking a leg.",
      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",

      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",
      "Athena made it further south than any other lander, reaching the Mons Mouton region which is a flat-topped mountain about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole.",
      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",
      "The sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.",

      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",

    "story": [
      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",

      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",

      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 09:40:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "Prof Martin - former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre - says it looks as if X was targeted by what's known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where hackers flood a server with internet traffic to prevent users from connecting to a website.",

      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",
      "However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.",
      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",

      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "Why is there talk of a deal now?",
      "DR Congo is in trouble militarily.",
      "M23 fighters - backed by neighbouring Rwanda - have made major advances in parts of the mineral-rich east of the country.",
      "Regional forces - first from east and then southern Africa - which were supposed to provide some help have failed to hold back the rebels. The M23 has talked about advancing west in a bid to seize the capital, Kinshasa, even though it is 1,600km (1,000 miles) away.",
      "Given the dangers, it is not surprising that President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi might be looking at ways to shore up his position.",
      "On 22 February, Tshisekedi was reported by the New York Times to have said that the Trump administration had shown interest in a deal involving strategic minerals.",
      "The day before, the Africa-USA Business Council - a lobby group - wrote to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on behalf of a Congolese senator describing a possible deal that included an \"economic and military partnership\".",
      "What could be in it for the US?",
      "DR Congo is estimated to have $24tn-worth (\u00a319tn) of untapped resources - including cobalt, gold and copper.",
      "The country is currently the world's largest supplier of cobalt - which has defence and aerospace applications as well as being essential for batteries in electric vehicles - but most of this goes to China. It also has significant lithium, tantalum and uranium deposits, which also have military uses.",
      "Though the US is investing in a huge infrastructure project - the Lobito corridor - designed to transport goods out of central Africa to a port in Angola, its companies are not involved in mining in DR Congo.",
      "As China dominates the Congolese mineral sector, there could be \"a widening strategic gap, where adversarial nations continue to monopolise Africa's resources\", the letter to Rubio said.",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "Who is M23 leader Sultani Makenga?",
      "Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",
      "In theory, DR Congo could offer favourable terms to US companies to exploit the resources.",
      "But, according to mining analyst Gregory Mthembu-Salter, as the US, unlike China, relies on private commercial companies to do the work, they may decide that it is too risky to do business there.",
      "But this is all highly speculative and a US Department of State spokesperson said that there was \"nothing to preview or announce at this time\".",
      "Nevertheless, the US \"is open to discussing partnerships in this sector\" that align with the executive order aimed at making the US a \"leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals\".",
      "How could the DR Congo benefit?",
      "One key area could be in \"strengthening military co-operation\", as the letter to Rubio puts it.",
      "This would involve:",
      "Training and equipping soldiers \"to protect mineral supply routes\"Giving the US access to military bases \"to protect strategic resources\"And \"replacing ineffective UN peacekeeping operations with direct US-DRC security co-operation\".",

      "And \"replacing ineffective UN peacekeeping operations with direct US-DRC security co-operation\".",
      "The Congolese spokesperson declined to confirm these details, but there is some scepticism about how realistic and immediately effective they could be.",
      "According to Stephanie Wolters, regional analyst for the South African Institute of International Affairs, if Kinshasa wants a US military presence in the east then \"that is not very likely to happen\".",
      "Furthermore, \"weapons and training are longer-term issues\", she told BBC Focus on Africa.",
      "\"I think the outreach the Congolese government has made is surely because of the active military situation in the east and I'm not convinced that what the US might offer in return is really something that can address the acute need at the moment.\"",
      "Congolese mining industry analyst Jean-Pierre Okenda said some oversight of the deal would be wise, suggesting parliament and civil society should also be consulted if it was going to serve the interests of the people.",
      "Looking at the bigger picture, he said that moves towards a more peaceful future need to address the \"kleptocratic management of the state\".",
      "A previous deal with China that gave access to minerals in exchange for infrastructure projects was criticised for not delivering on some of what was promised.",
      "Tshisekedi has since renegotiated this, but the lack of transparency in those talks has been criticised.",
      "What next?",
      "Nothing concrete is likely to happen soon.",
      "While Muyaya, speaking for Kinshasa, was vague on what we could expect, he told the BBC that \"in the coming days we can have more details to share\".",
      "He added that there was \"the political will [from Tshisekedi] and I think the US has attention on those questions\".",
      "On the US side, according to the news website Semafor, President Trump is due to announce that Massad Boulos will be the White House's new Great Lakes regional envoy.",
      "He is the father of Michael Boulos, who is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany, and has been serving as Trump's senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs since December.",

      "The Constitutional Court issued the final ruling on Tuesday afternoon after deliberating for two hours. It said the decision was unanimous.",
      "The Central Electoral Bureau had earlier rejected Georgescu's candidacy for a rerun of the presidential election in May.",
      "Georgescu had won the first round of last year's presidential vote, but it was annulled after intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in setting up almost 800 TikTok accounts backing him.",
      "On Sunday, the election bureau said Georgescu's candidacy did not \"meet the conditions of legality\", as he \"violated the very obligation to defend democracy\".",
      "Georgescu appealed that verdict the following day.",

      "A man dressed in a traditional peasant smock scaled a lamppost with a giant Romanian flag and waved it enthusiastically over the crowd.",
      "They chanted \"Calin Georgescu is president\" and \"freedom\", and condemned the judges as traitors. One woman had a sign that read \"Stop dictatorship\".",
      "It took a while for news of the ruling upholding the ban to reach the crowd. When it did, there were loud \"boos\" directed at the judges inside.",
      "The crowd soon became noisy and angry, saying they had come to the streets to defend democracy.",
      "Calin Georgescu, the man they support, has come from the far-right fringes of Romanian politics, but he is now at the forefront and promises to make Romania great again.",
      "On 26 February, he was detained for questioning on his way to register as a candidate for the May election, prompting tens of thousands of Romanians to take to the streets of Bucharest in protest.",

      "George Simion, an ally of Georgescu and the leader of the far-right opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) wrote on Facebook: \"Shame! You will not defeat us. The people of Romania have awoken. They will win.\"",
      "The presidential election was annulled after Georgescu won the first round in November 2024, when intelligence was released suggesting a giant TikTok promotion campaign for Georgescu had been backed by Russia.",
      "To European leaders and many in Romania it looked like Russia was trying to weaken Europe and undermine its liberal values.",
      "That is still the opinion of many Romanians who fear a man who admires Vladimir Putin and dislikes Nato.",

    "story": [
      "Indian Americans are increasingly optimistic about India's future, but hold deep concerns about US-India relations under a second Donald Trump administration, a new survey finds.",
      "The 2024 Indian-American Survey, conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and YouGov in October, examined Indian-American political attitudes.",
      "Two pivotal elections happened in India and the US last year, amid a deepening - but occasionally strained - partnership. Tensions between the countries flared over a US federal indictment of Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and allegations of a Delhi-backed assassination plot on American soil.",
      "With more than five million Indian-origin residents in the US, the survey asked some key questions: How do Indian Americans view former president Joe Biden's handling of US-India ties? Do they see Donald Trump as a better option? And how do they assess India's trajectory post the 2024 election?",
      "Here are some key takeaways from the report, which was based on a nationally representative online survey of 1,206 Indian-American adult residents.",
      "Trump v Biden on India",
      "Indian Americans rated the Biden administration's handling of US-India relations more favourably than Trump's first term.",
      "A hypothetical Kamala Harris administration was seen as better for bilateral ties than a second Trump term during the polling.",
      "Partisan polarisation plays a key role: 66% of Indian-American Republicans believe Trump was better for US-India ties, while just 8% of Democrats agree.",
      "Conversely, half of Indian-American Democrats favour Biden, compared to 15% of Republicans.",
      "Since most Indian Americans are Democrats, this gives Biden the overall edge.",
      "During their February meeting at the White House, both Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised each other's leadership, but Trump criticised India's high trade tariffs, calling them a \"big problem.\"",
      "'Murder-for-hire' controversy",
      "The alleged Indian plot to assassinate a separatist on US soil has not widely registered - only half of respondents are aware of it.",
      "In October, the US charged a former Indian intelligence officer with attempted murder and money laundering for allegedly plotting to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US-based advocate for an independent Sikh state, Khalistan.",
      "This marked the first time the Indian government has been directly implicated in an alleged assassination attempt on a dissident. India has stated it is co-operating with the US investigation. In January, a panel set up by India to examine Washington's allegations recommended legal action against an unnamed individual believed to be the former intelligence agent.",
      "A narrow majority of the respondents said that India would \"not be justified in taking such action and hold identical feelings about the US if the positions were reversed\".",
      "Israel and the Palestinians",
      "Indian Americans are split along partisan party lines, with Democrats expressing greater empathy for Palestinians and Republicans leaning pro-Israel.",
      "Four in 10 respondents believe Biden has been too pro-Israel in the ongoing conflict.",
      "The attack in October 2023 by Hamas fighters from Gaza killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and saw 251 people taken hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Talks to prolong the fragile ceasefire, the first phase of which ended on 1 March, are expected to resume in Qatar on Monday.",
      "India's outlook brightens",
      "Forty-seven percent of Indian Americans believe India is heading in the right direction, a 10 percentage point increase from four years ago.",
      "The same share approves of Modi's performance as prime minister. Additionally, four in 10 respondents feel that India's 2024 election - where Modi's party did not get a majority - made the country more democratic.",
      "The survey found that many Indian Americans support Modi and believe India is on the right track, yet half are unaware of the alleged assassination attempt on US soil.",
      "Does this indicate a gap in information access, selective engagement or a tendency to overlook certain actions in favour of broader nationalist sentiment?",
      "\"It is hard to tease out the precise reason for this, but our sense is that this has more to do with selective engagement,\" Milan Vaishnav, co-author of the study, said.",
      "Data collected by Carnegie in 2020 shows that around 60% of Indian Americans follow Indian government and public affairs regularly, leaving a significant portion who \"engage only sporadically\".",
      "\"Often people form broad impressions based on a combination of the news, social media and interactions with friends and family. Given the deluge of news in the US of late, it is not entirely surprising that the 'murder-for-hire' plot did not break through for a large section of the community,\" Mr Vaishnav said.",
      "Indian Americans, while cautious about Trump and generally favouring Biden or Harris for US-India relations, continue to strongly support Modi back in India. Given Modi's nationalist policies, what accounts for this divergence? Is it driven more by personal impact than ideology?",
      "\"This is a case of 'where you sit is where you stand',\" Mr Vaishnav said.",
      "He said in related research, \"we've explored this question in depth and found that Indian Americans generally hold more liberal views on US policy issues compared to India\".",
      "\"For instance, while Muslim Indian-Americans \u2013 minorities both in India and the US \u2013 maintain consistently more liberal attitudes, Hindu Indian-Americans express liberal views in the US (where they are a minority) but more conservative stances in India, where they belong to the majority.",
      "\"In other words, a person's majority or minority status plays a key role in shaping their political views,\" Mr Vaishnav said.",
      "If Indian Americans viewed Trump as a threat to bilateral ties, why did they embrace him during his first term, as seen at events like 'Howdy Modi!'? Has their opinion of Trump shifted due to his policies, or is it more about changing political currents?",
      "\"We should not generalise from one event or even one segment of the Indian American population. More than 50,000 Indian Americans gathered at 'Howdy, Modi!' first and foremost to see Modi, not Trump. Recall that Trump was added at a later date,\" Mr Vaishnav said.",
      "\"Second, this is a diverse diaspora with a range of political views. While Indian Americans lean overwhelmingly toward the Democratic Party, a very sizeable minority - we estimate around 30% in 2024 - support the Republicans under Trump.\"",
      "Indian Americans remain committed to the Democratic Party, but attachment has waned. Some 47% identify as Democrats, down from 56% in 2020, a survey found last year.",
      "Do Indian Americans have a nuanced understanding of political developments in both countries, or are their views more influenced by diaspora-driven narratives and media echo chambers?",
      "Mr Vaishnav said data from 2020 shows that online news was the primary source of information about India, followed by television, social media and word of mouth. Within social media, YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp were the most common platforms.",
      "\"Direct engagement with India is more limited, with foreign-born Indian Americans typically more involved than those born in the US.",
      "\"Having said that, one should not overlook the fact that the bonds of cultural connectivity remain quite strong, even with second and third-generation Indian Americans.\"",

      "The confidence motion was tabled by the government itself, after the opposition Socialists announced plans for a parliamentary inquiry into Montenegro's business dealings.",
      "A company called Spinumviva, set up by Lu\u00eds Montenegro, continued to receive sizeable sums from clients he had previously secured, even after he was elected Social Democratic Party (PSD) president and leader of the opposition in 2022, and had transferred ownership to his wife and two sons.",
      "The legality of the transfer to his wife was questioned by the opposition, given that the marriage is one in which assets are jointly held; the couple have since made their sons sole owners.",
      "But questions remain about the sources of the company's income \u2013 which until a few days ago included \u20ac4,500 (\u00a33,800) a month from hotels and casino group Solverde, whose gambling concession is up for review \u2013 as well as the identity of other clients, which the prime minister has declined to reveal, and the services Spinumviva offers.",

      "None of the major parties appear keen on a snap election \u2013 not least because they fear voters will not be enthusiastic at having to choose a new government when the current one has been in office for less than a year \u2013 and the timing is poor in geopolitical terms.",
      "However, Portugal appears set on an unswerving path for May elections.",
      "Not only has the prime minister chosen to appeal to voters rather than face an inquiry, a stance described as \"cowardly\" by the leader of the opposition.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's vow to take over Greenland has shone a global spotlight on the island's elections.",
    "story": [
      "Residents of Greenland are going to the polls in a vote that in previous years has drawn little outside attention - but which may prove pivotal for the Arctic territory's future.",
      "US President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's future ties with Copenhagen.",
      "\"There's never been a spotlight like this on Greenland before,\" says Nauja Bianco, a Danish-Greenlandic policy expert on the Arctic.",
      "Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen.",
      "Now, five out of six parties on the ballot favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.",
      "Voting takes place over 11 hours at 72 polling stations, and ends at 20:00 local time on Tuesday (22:00G).",
      "The debate over independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.",
      "The island's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught the US president's eye. He first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in 2019.",
      "Since taking office again in January, he has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands.",
      "Addressing the US Congress last week, however, Trump again doubled down. \"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,\" he said, prompting applause and laughter from a number of politicians, including Vice-President JD Vance.",
      "In Nuuk, his words struck a nerve with politicians who were quick to condemn them. \"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" Prime Minister Mute Egede said.",
      "Still, the US interest has stoked calls for Greenland to break away from Denmark, with much of the debate focused on when \u2013 not if \u2013 the process of independence should begin.",
      "Greenland's independence goal is not new, Nauja Bianco points out, and has been decades in the making.",
      "A string of revelations about past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes have hurt Greenlandic public opinion about Denmark. Earlier this year, PM Egede said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\".",
      "But it is the first time the subject has taken centre stage in an election.",
      "Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of Prime Minister Mute Egede, favours gradual steps towards autonomy. \"Citizens must feel secure,\" he told local media.",
      "Arctic expert Martin Breum says Egede's handling of the challenge from Trump and strong words against Denmark over past colonial wrongdoings \"will give him a lot of votes\".",
      "Smaller rivals could also gain ground and potentially shake up alliances.",
      "Opposition party Naleraq wants to immediately kick-off divorce proceedings from Copenhagen and have closer defence dealings with Washington.",
      "Pointing to Greenland's EU departure and Brexit, party leader Pele Broberg has said that Greenland could be \"out of the Danish kingdom in three years\".",
      "Naleraq is fielding the largest number of candidates and has gained momentum by riding the wave of discontent with Denmark.",
      "\"Naleraq will also be a larger factor too in parliament,\" predicts Mr Breum, who says party candidates have performed well on TV and on social media.",
      "However, the centre-right Demokraatit party believes it is too soon to push for independence.",
      "\"The economy will have to be much stronger than it is today,\" party candidate Justus Hansen told Reuters.",
      "Greenland's economy is driven by fishing, and government spending relies on annual subsidies from Denmark.",
      "They lost 52 soldiers fighting alongside the US. Now they feel threatened by Trump",
      "Inside the race for Greenland's mineral wealth",
      "Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",
      "Talk of Trump and independence has overshadowed other key issues for voters, says newspaper editor Masaana Egede.",
      "\"It's an election where we should be talking about healthcare, care of the elderly and social problems. Almost everything is about independence.\"",
      "According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back moves towards future statehood.",
      "About 44,000 people are eligible to vote, and given the low numbers and few polls, results are difficult to forecast.",
      "Even though a majority of Greenlanders favour independence, a survey has shown that half would be less enthusiastic about independence if that meant lower living standards.",
      "One poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to become a part of the United States, and nearly half see Trump's interest as a threat.",
      "One fear among some Greenlanders, says Masaana Egede, is how long the Arctic island could remain independent and whether it would break off from Denmark only to have another country \"standing on our coasts and start taking over\".",
      "Experts say it is this worry that could steer votes towards keeping the status quo.",
      "Although Greenland's right to self-determination is enshrined into law by the 2009 Self-Rule Act, there are several steps to take before the territory could break away from Denmark, including holding a referendum.",
      "This means getting full independence could take \"about 10 to 15 years,\" says Kaj Kleist, a veteran Greenlandic politician and civil servant who prepared the Self-Rule Act.",
      "\"There is lot of preparation and negotiations with the Danish government before you can make that a reality,\" he adds.",
      "Whatever the election's outcome, experts do not believe Greenland could become independent before Trump's second term is over in 2028.",
      "The results are expected in the early hours of Wednesday."

      "It wrote in its annual report that while Sweden joining the Nato military alliance had strengthened its security, it had also led to increased Russian intelligence activity. Russia denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Sapo also said that the security situation in Sweden was serious - with foreign powers operating in more threatening ways, with hybrid warfare, alongside incidents of violent extremism.",
      "Charlotte von Essen, the head of Sapo, said there was a \"tangible risk that the security situation can deteriorate further\" in a way that may be hard to predict.",
      "Sweden became a Nato member last year, seeing it as the best guarantee against Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "That January, its civil defence minister warned \"there could be war in Sweden\" in the near future due to Russian aggression.",
      "Sapo said on Tuesday that Russia's intelligence activities were primarily aimed at undermining cohesion between Nato members, counteracting Western support for Ukraine, and circumventing sanctions.",
      "It said these activities showed Russia was becoming \"increasingly offensive and risk-prone\" in the face of a build-up of Swedish, and wider European, defences.",
      "\"When gathering intelligence, the Russian security and intelligence services use a wide range of resources and different platforms,\" the agency wrote, adding that these activities had been limited by expelling intelligence officers.",
      "Ms von Essen said Swedes needed to be vigilant about \"widespread anti-state narratives and conspiracy theories\" that seek to act as a destabilising force, adding that it was \"important that we do not normalise the new situation\".",
      "In its report, Sapo mentioned suspicious incidents involving infrastructure and which countries may have been behind them \"in some cases\".",
      "A series of undersea cables and gas pipelines have been damaged in suspected attacks since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting Nato to launch a monitoring mission in the sea.",
      "The latest such breach was reported last month near Gotland - Sweden's largest island.",
      "Russia denies any involvement in efforts to interfere with countries' democratic systems or of seeking to sabotage their economies.",
      "The Swedish government also identified Iran and China as posing significant security threats to the Nordic country.",
      "Last year, Sapo accused Iranian intelligence of hacking into a text messaging service to send 15,000 messages to Swedes, after several Quran burnings. Iran calls any such allegations \"baseless\".",
      "Sapo's 2025 report said foreign intelligence threats included cyber-attacks, technology theft and tracking the movement of foreign dissidents living in Sweden - the latter two allegedly carried out by China. Beijing also denies any such involvement.",
      "Sapo also said the threat of terrorism remains high, but was diversifying to not just include \"ideologically motivated actors\", but also violence instigated by a foreign power and young people with a fascination with violence who have been radicalised online.",
      "Ms von Essen said that Sapo had seen examples of nations including Russia and Iran inducing individuals, often young people, to carry out acts of violence.",
      "Serious attacks have occurred in France, Germany and Austria, the Sapo chief said.",
      "Sweden itself was dealing with the aftermath of \"the terrible incident in Orebro\", she noted, referring to Sweden's worst mass shooting last month, in which a gunman attacked an education centre in central Sweden, killing nine people.",
      "Sapo said violent Islamist extremism and violent right-wing terrorism remained prominent threats.",
      "Sweden remains on high alert for terrorism - with the threat level assessed at four out of a five-point scale.",
      "Sweden searches for answers after country's deadliest shooting",

      "In September 2023, a Muslim woman was sentenced to two years' prison for blaspheming Islam, after she posted a viral TikTok video where she said an Islamic phrase before eating pork.",
      "In 2024, another TikToker was detained for blasphemy after they posted a quiz asking children what kind of animals can read the Quran, according to Amnesty International.",
      "Indonesia is home to many religious minorities, including Buddhists, Christians and Hindus. But a vast majority of Indonesians are Muslim \u2013 and most cases of people found in violation of the EIT Law have typically related to religious minorities allegedly insulting Islam.",
      "Ms Thalisa's case, where a Muslim woman is accused of invoking hate speech against Christianity, is less common.",
      "Prosecutors previously demanded that she receive a sentence of more than four years, and immediately appealed against Monday's verdict. Ms Thalisa was given seven days to appeal."

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:48:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The ex-president is on his way to the International Criminal Court following his arrest in Manila.",
    "story": [
      "Just short of his 80th birthday, Rodrigo Duterte, a man who once vowed to purge his country through a bloody anti-drugs and crime campaign, found himself outmanoeuvred and in custody.",
      "The former president was met by Philippines police as he arrived in Manila on a flight from Hong Kong, where he had been rallying support for his candidates for the upcoming mid-term election among the large Filipino diaspora there.",
      "The much-talked-about warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court (ICC) was, it turned out, already in the hands of the Philippines government, which moved swiftly to execute it.",
      "A frail-looking Mr Duterte, walking with a stick, was moved to an air force base within the airport perimeter. A chartered jet was quickly prepared to take him to the ICC in The Hague.",
      "How had this happened? How had a man so powerful and popular, often called \"the Trump of Asia\", been brought so low?",
      "In vain, his lawyers and family members protested that the arrest had no legal basis and complained that Duterte's frail health was being neglected.",
      "Duterte: The provocative but popular Philippine strongman",
      "While in office, Mr Duterte formed an alliance with the Marcos family \u2013 the children of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos who had long been working on a political comeback. Mr Duterte could not run again in the 2022 election, but his daughter Sara, mayor of southern city of Davao, was also popular and a strong contender to replace him.",
      "However, Ferdinand Marcos's son Bongbong, who had been in politics all his life, was also well placed to win and very well-funded.",
      "The two families struck a deal. They would work together to get Bongbong into the presidency and Sara into the vice-presidency, on the assumption that come the next election in 2028, her turn would come and she would have the formidable Marcos machine behind her.",
      "It worked. Both won their positions by a wide margin. Mr Duterte expected that his alliance would protect him from any blowback over his controversial presidency once he was out of power.",
      "The most serious threat hanging over him was an investigation by the ICC into his culpability for thousands of extrajudicial killings carried out during anti-drugs campaigns he ordered - after he became president in 2016, but also during his tenure as mayor of the southern city of Davao from 2011.",
      "Mr Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the ICC in 2019, but its prosecutors argued they still had a mandate to look into alleged crimes against humanity committed before that, and launched a formal investigation in 2021. However, President Marcos initially stated that his government would not co-operate with the ICC.",
      "That position only changed after the dramatic breakdown of the Duterte-Marcos alliance. Strains in their relationship were evident from the earliest days of the administration, when Sara Duterte's request to be given control of the powerful defence ministry was turned down and she was given the education ministry instead.",
      "President Marcos also distanced himself from his predecessor's mercurial policies, mending fences with the US, standing up to China in contested seas, and stopping the blood-curdling threats of retribution against drug dealers.",
      "In the end, these were two ambitious, power-hungry clans aiming to dominate Filipino politics, and there was not enough power for them to share. Relations reached a nadir last year when Sara Duterte announced that she had hired an assassin to kill President Marcos, should anything happen to her.",
      "Late last year, the lower house of Congress, which is controlled by Marcos loyalists, filed a petition to impeach Ms Duterte. That trial is due to take place in the Senate later this year.",
      "If she is impeached, under the constitution, she would be barred from holding high political office, killing her long-standing presidential ambitions and weakening the political power of the Dutertes even further.",
      "President Marcos now appears to have moved deftly to neutralise his main political rival. But his strategy is not risk-free. The Dutertes remain popular in much of the country, and may be able to mobilise protests against the former president's prosecution.",
      "Sara Duterte has issued a statement accusing the government of surrendering her father to \"foreign powers\" and of violating Filipino sovereignty.",
      "An early test of the support enjoyed by both clans will be the mid-term elections in May.",
      "In his comments to journalists after the plane carrying his predecessor had taken off from Manila, President Marcos insisted he was meeting the country's commitments to Interpol, which had delivered the ICC warrant. But he was coy about the fact that it was an ICC warrant he was executing, given that many Filipinos will question what the ICC's remit is in a country which has already left its jurisdiction.",
      "It is not risk-free for the ICC either. The court is an embattled institution these days, with the Trump administration threatening to arrest its top officials should they travel to the US, and few countries willing to extradite those it has indicted. Getting former President Duterte to The Hague might therefore look like a welcome high-profile success.",
      "But there was a warning, from China \u2013 admittedly not a signatory to the ICC and currently at loggerheads with the Philippines \u2013 not to politicise ICC cases. This was a thinly-veiled reference to the fact that this case, which is supposed to be about accountability for serious international crimes, has ended up playing a decisive part in a domestic feud in the Philippines between two rival political forces."

      "Their attendance at the Gada ceremony is an opportunity to learn, prepare and bond as it is already known who from this age-group will be named Abbaa Gadaa in 2033.",
      "The main event at the recent Gada ceremony was the handover of power, from the outgoing 48-year-old Abbaa Gadaa to his younger successor.",
      "Well-wishers crossed the border from Kenya and others travelled from as far as Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to witness the spectacle. The governor of Kenya's Marsabit county was among the honoured guests.",

      "How does voting work?",

      "The sheer size of Greenland and the remoteness of many of its settlements and small towns means delivering ballots on time can be a challenge.",
      "No two towns are connected by road or rail, and the island is exposed to extreme Arctic weather.",
      "Back in 2018, the 55 residents of Savissivik in northern Greenland never received their ballots due to inclement weather, according to Danish reports. So an Air Greenland base manager on his 4x4 and a local hunter on dog sled joined forces to deliver the ballots on time.",

      "He is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.",
      "The character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.",
      "Making a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.",
      "\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.",
      "There was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.",
      "The final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.",
      "That's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.",
      "This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Avoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says.",

      "Mo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".",
      "\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.",
      "There was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.",
      "\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.",
      "\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"",
      "The show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.",
      "It tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.",

      "\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"",

    "summary": "In a speech to allies and in that infamous Oval Office row, the vice-president came out punching - but what is he fighting for?",
    "story": [
      "An argument in the White House tore apart the US alliance with Ukraine, shook European leaders and highlighted JD Vance's key role in forcefully expressing Donald Trump's foreign policy. The vice-president has come out punching on the global stage - so what is it that drives his worldview?",
      "Vance's first major foreign speech, at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, caught many by surprise.",
      "Rather than focusing on the war raging in Ukraine, the US vice-president only briefly mentioned the bloodiest European conflict since World War Two.",
      "Instead, he used his debut on the international stage to berate close US allies about immigration and free speech, suggesting the European establishment was anti-democratic. He accused them of ignoring the wills of their people and questioned what shared values they were truly banding together with the US to defend.",
      "\"If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,\" he warned.",
      "It was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies. But days later he was back in the news, at the centre of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.",
      "For those who have been studying the rise of Vance, these two episodes came as no surprise.",
      "The vice-president has come to represent an intellectual wing of the conservative movement that gives expression to Trumpism and in particular how its America First mantra applies beyond its borders. In writings and interviews, Vance has expressed an ideology that seems to join the dots between American workers, global elites and the role of the US in the wider world.",
      "On the campaign trail with Donald Trump last year, Vance spent much of his time sharply criticising Democrats - the usual attack-dog duties that traditionally get dished out to running mates - and sparring with reporters.",
      "The 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist who became vice-presidentVance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Why?",
      "The 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist who became vice-president",
      "Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Why?",
      "And while Elon Musk's outsized and unconventional role in the Trump administration initially overshadowed him, that Munich speech and the Oval Office showdown have raised the profile of Trump's deputy.",
      "It's also led to questions about the winding ideological journey he's made during his years in the conservative movement - and what he truly believes now.",
      "\"He's much more of a pragmatist than an ideologue,\" said James Orr, associate professor of philosophy of religion at the University of Cambridge and a friend whom Vance has described as his \"British sherpa\".",
      "\"He's able to articulate what is and is not in the American interest,\" Orr said. \"And the American interest is not the interest of some abstract utopia or matrix of propositions and ideas, but the American people.\"",
      "Vance has repeatedly returned to this \"America First\" - or perhaps \"Americans First\" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.",
      "At the Republican National Convention last summer, for example, he lamented how in small towns across the US \"jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to war\". And he attacked then-President Joe Biden, saying: \"For half a century, he's been a champion of every single policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer.\"",
      "But Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.",
      "Not only is he a former \"Never Trumper\" who described the US president in 2016 as \"reprehensible\" and \"an idiot\", his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.",
      "More recently he's shifted that blame to elites \u2013 a group he's variously defined as Democrats, conventional Republicans, liberals, corporate leaders, globalists and academics.",
      "In speeches, Vance regularly argues that \"America is not just an idea\u2026 America is a nation.\"",
      "He couples this statement with an anecdote about his family's ancestral graveyard in Kentucky, where he says he, his wife and their children will one day be buried, arguing that family and homeland are more important than some of America's traditional core ideas.",
      "In Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.",
      "Rod Dreher, a conservative American writer who is also a friend of the vice-president, said Vance's thinking arises from a belief that \"moderate normie Republicans\u2026 failed to offer anything to stop the so-called forever wars, and they also failed to offer anything to ordinary Americans like where he comes from, who are suffering economically from globalism and from the effects of mass migration and fentanyl\".",
      "\"He got red-pilled, so to speak, by Donald Trump,\" Dreher told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme this week.",

      "Vance is a vice-president who, more than his boss, seems extremely plugged into internet culture. He's an enthusiastic user of X, often jumping directly into arguments rather than using it, as many politicians do, as a platform for announcements.",
      "His appearances on fringe right-wing podcasts, while he was trying to drum up support for a Senate run, provided fodder for his opponents, as did provocative trollish comments such as that the US was being run by \"childless cat ladies\".",

      "At the same time, Young said, his anecdote about family graveyards and homeland suggests another political tendency - a \"disturbing undertone of nativism\".",
      "\"That bothers some people and rightly so,\" she said. \"Part of the American legacy is that we are a nation of immigrants. [Former Republican President] Ronald Reagan talked about that, about one of the distinctive things about this country is that anyone can come here from any part of the world and become an American.\"",
      "Vance's \"Americans First\" thinking clearly extends to the issue of the war in Ukraine. When he was a senator, he was often critical of America's involvement in the war and the huge sums spent on it, his former Senate colleague Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, recalled.",
      "\"His position then was very much like what it is now\u2026 that the conflict must end,\" Hawley told the BBC. \"It needs to end in a way that's maximally advantageous to the security of the United States and it needs to end in a way that gets our European allies to take increased responsibility.\"",
      "Vance regularly accused the Biden administration of being more interested in Ukraine than in stemming illegal immigration. Writing in 2022, during his Senate campaign and after the Russian invasion, he said: \"I will be damned if I am going to prioritise Ukraine's eastern border right now when our own southern border is engulfed by a human tsunami of illegal migrants.\"",
      "His views burst out into the open during that dramatic argument with President Zelensky in the Oval Office. Vance accused Zelensky of lacking respect, of sending politicians on a \"propaganda tour\" of Ukraine and of being insufficiently thankful for US aid.",
      "\"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" he told the Ukrainian president.",
      "The argument left European leaders scrambling to defend Zelensky, while also trying to maintain negotiations over a possible peace deal.",
      "Vance then prompted widespread outrage from allies when he poured scorn on the idea of security guarantees in the form of troops \"from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "He later denied he was talking about the UK or France, the only two European countries that have publicly stated their willingness to send peacekeepers to Ukraine.",

      "\"He was not in any way the culture warrior that he is today,\" Frum said.",
      "Frum, a former George W Bush speechwriter and staunch critic of Trump, said that Vance's view of Russia represented \"ideological admiration\".",

      "\"We don't have to agree with him. We can contest him and we often will contest him,\" he said. \"But the fact that he's a bad guy does not mean we can't engage in basic diplomacy and prioritising America's interests.\"",

    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

      "Addressing a crowd of Liberal supporters after the result of the leadership contest was announced on Sunday evening, Carney promised to face down the threats from Trump, over the tariffs and the claims on Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\"Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said. \"We didn't ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves.",
      "\"Americans should make no mistake\", he warned. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"",
      "He repeatedly referred to the US president by name and said his government would keep retaliatory tariffs in place until \"America shows us respect\".",
      "How he will translate his strong language on the stage in Ottawa into practical solutions to those twin challenges was, however, far less clear.",
      "Liberals might hope that Trudeau's exit from the stage will, in itself, help clear the air.",
      "Instead of the frequent mocking of Trudeau by Trump as a \"weak\" leader, they might dare to believe that Carney will at least be able to reset the personal chemistry.",
      "On the other hand, if he has to push hard in an attempt to win concessions, will he also risk incurring the wrath of a man who uses unpredictability as a political art form?",
      "Much of that will depend on how serious the US president is in his insistence that he wants to impose real economic pain on Canada and annex its territory.",

      "Did he think Trump was being serious?",
      "\"You know, I don't know,\" he told me. \"Do you know? Does anyone know? I'm not a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. He changes his mind every two or three hours. So [for him] to be leader of the free world, it is preoccupying for everybody.\"",
      "While the US threat is dominating Canadian politics - Carney described the current situation as \"dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust\" - there are still domestic political matters to focus on too, not least the prospect of a general election.",
      "Once sworn in as prime minister in the coming days, Carney will have to decide whether to call a snap election. If he doesn't, the opposition parties in parliament could force one later this month through a no-confidence vote.",
      "Before Trudeau said he was stepping down, the Liberal Party was facing electoral oblivion.",
      "After nine years in power, he'd become a liability and a lightning rod for public anger over the rising cost of living despite record levels of government spending and a ballooning national debt.",
      "The stage appeared to be set for the Liberals to be swept from power by a Conservative Party under the stewardship of the young, populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who had turned lambasting Trudeau into something of a sport.",
      "Now, not only has he lost the advantage of a deeply unpopular opponent, his political style is at risk of appearing out of step. In the current environment, even a loose alignment with the politics of Trump is a potential liability with Canadian voters.",
      "The Republican president, for his part, recently said Canada's Conservative leader was not Maga enough.",
      "The Liberal Party is suddenly feeling a sense of rejuvenation - the gap in the opinion polls with the Conservatives, once a gulf, has narrowed dramatically. And you could feel that palpable sense of optimism in the room on Sunday evening.",
      "Aware of the danger, Poilievre accused Liberals of \"trying to trick Canadians\" to elect them to a fourth term. But his statement also highlighted how Trump is changing the political messaging on this side of the border.",
      "\"It is the same Liberal team that drove up taxes, housing costs, and food prices, while Carney personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States,\" Poilievre wrote.",
      "\"We need a new Conservative government that will put Canada First - for a change.\"",

      "The Conservatives may still lead in the polls, but for the first time in a long time, the Liberals believe that, under Carney, they have a fighting chance again."

      "The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.",
      "But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.",

      "But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.",
      "So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.",
      "So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.",
      "\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tesla facilities across the US are facing protests and vandalism in response to the political role Elon Musk, who owns the car manufacturer, has played in the Trump administration.",
      "Most \"Tesla Takedown\" protests have been peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.",
      "That was followed by six arrests in New York over the weekend when hundreds of protesters occupied a Tesla showroom.",
      "There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk.",
      "One woman showed up to a protest outside a Burbank Tesla on Sunday with an expletive and Musk's name scrawled in chalk across her white Model X sedan. Another car carried an \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" sticker.",
      "The protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk's influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "So far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans.",
      "Critics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire \"President Musk\", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. Some at the protest in Burbank held signs that said \"Deport Elon\" and \"Boycott Swasticar\" - with protesters attempting to connect the car to fascism.",
      "Tesla produced the must-have electric cars for many Americans with progressive views, but several protesters said they regretted their purchase after Musk involved himself with Trump and US politics.",
      "Karen Rabwin, a protester at the Burbank Tesla on Sunday, attended just two days after trading in her Tesla for a Cadillac. She had slapped a bumper sticker on her old vehicle that read \"Bought This Car Before We Knew\" in a veiled reference to Musk, but she felt that wasn't enough.",
      "\"It was embarrassing,\" she said of driving the Tesla. \"It wasn't what I stood for. How could I drive that car? I have principles.\"",
      "Singer Sheryl Crow donated her Tesla to National Public Radio last month. She posted a video to Instagram waving goodbye to the car as it was towed away.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" Ms Crow wrote.",
      "Musk has responded to the protests by sharing a video on X - the social media platform he owns - of a Cybertruck customer in Texas marvelling at the vehicle's full self-driving mode.",
      "\"Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices,\" Musk wrote.",
      "The social media platform has many posts of Tesla owners showcasing their electric cars. But there are also now videos showing a growing trend of Cybertrucks vandalised with swastikas, used as skate ramps or covered in garbage.",
      "During Mardi Gras in New Orleans, spectators booed an orange Cybertruck and pelted it with beads, calling the futuristic looking vehicle a \"Deplorean\" or other unfriendly monikers.",
      "Protesters on Sunday said they want to take down Telsa's value because they are concerned that Mr Musk is damaging the economy and the the country - and their efforts may be having an effect.",
      "While Tesla's share price surged after Trump was elected - with Musk by his side on election night in Florida - they have tumbled back to pre-election levels following the  backlash to Musk's political involvement.",
      "Some on Sunday also raised concerns that Musk's government involvement is benefiting his businesses.",
      "Critics note that the tech entrepeneur's companies have billions of dollars of contracts with the US government, primarily with Nasa and the Defense Department, which are increasingly reliant on Musk's SpaceX for satellite launches and space exploration.",
      "Last week, reports claimed the Musk had attempted to get the Federal Aviation Administration to cancel a $2.4bn (\u00a31.9bn) contract with Verizon to revamp the agency's telecommunications system and awarding it to Starlink, a company owned by SpaceX, instead.",
      "SpaceX denied that report, posting on X that \"Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract\".",
      "Some constituents are furious at Musk's involvement and the White House's effort to cut certain jobs and programmes. Many have shown up at Republican town halls to protest the cuts and the tech billionaire's growing influence.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders urged members of their party to stop hosting events in response, claiming without evidence that they were being disrupted by \"professional protesters\"."

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "From the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

      "Her TikTok series \"Days of Girlhood\" became a viral sensation, attracting more than one billion views. As her profile grew, the 28-year-old became a regular on red carpets.",
      "Mulvaney said she knew her gender identity from an early age.",
      "\"I knew I was a girl. That was one of the purest thoughts and intentions I've ever had throughout my entire life was to be brought into this world and to, so clearly, know who I was, and then to be told otherwise, is very conflicting,\" she said.",
      "She first came out as gay at 14, but it took another decade to embrace her identity as a trans woman.",
      "\"I settled into the identity as gay because that was all I saw around me,\" she explained.",
      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts. Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "\"I didn't want it to be just a gimmick,\" De Niro said about the eventual decision to have him play both roles. \"But I thought there is something interesting about it.\"",
      "When discussing his approach to character preparation, De Niro noted that requirements vary by role. For his recent political series, \"Zero Day,\" he relied heavily on existing footage of politicians.",
      "\"There's so much out there about politicians and presidents and senators and Congress people that you see these interviews every day,\" he said. \"See them in all kinds of uncomfortable situations, this and that, how they react.\"",
      "De Niro, whose father was Italian and Irish while his mother had Dutch, French and German heritage, also acknowledged he \"identifies more with Italians\" when playing mob characters.",
      "The film includes a memorable scene featuring dogs in mink coats, which De Niro revealed was his idea.",

    "summary": "The Emmy Award-winning comedian and former \"SNL\" writer became a superstar as a stand-up; now, he's sitting down, as host of a Netflix talk show, \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.\"",
    "story": [
      "John Mulaney is a comedy superstar finding the funny in the familiar.\u00a0 At 42, he already has five highly-rated specials to his name \u2026 three primetime Emmys \u2026 and a reputation as one of the best stand-up guys in the game.",
      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",
      "It began as an experiment during the Netflix Comedy Festival last year, called \"Everybody's in L.A.,\" talking about \"L.A. things,\" like earthquakes and coyotes. Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",
      "To watch a teaser for \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" click on the video player below:",
      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before. I've collided with you some other time.' So, it's like these people came in that just, I don't know, make me like the world a lot more.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-vonn-on-skiing-the-comeback-trail/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:58:42 -0400",
    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",

      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

      "By the time it occurred to Cece that her mother was dying, she was dead. Even then, it seemed like possibly a mistake, like there was no way in hell her mother would have agreed to it. Cece hunched through the memorial service, unable to speak or move or smile. People hugged her, one after another, a series of random blows. At the national cemetery, she stood on the perfect lawn rolling down to a smudge of ocean in the distance, the tombstones a run of dominoes waiting to be tipped, feeling like she'd been beamed to an alien planet. She could not fathom her own fingers. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag-folding ceremony and a lone bugler playing \"Taps.\" The long, sorrowful notes floated over the cemetery, turning everything into the tragic plot point in a movie: the gravesites and their wilting flowers, the guards of honor frozen like statues, the hole in the ground where her mother would be lowered and transformed into a skeleton. Such was the grace and beauty of the bugler's playing that Cece, returning to Earth for a moment, couldn't help being moved. It seemed to give form to the precious void inside her. Then the bugler stopped in midnote, as if he'd forgotten what song he was performing. He turned red with embarrassment. Finally, he took the bugle from his lips and shook it, and it played the lost note for a second, as if possessed by a ghost. It wasn't a real instrument at all, Cece realized, but a stereo made to look like one. The thing had run out of charge. A couple of the mourners giggled. Cece glanced behind her, startled. Later, in the middle of the eulogy, the bugle began playing again from its case.",
      "Strangeness and sorrow. Strangeness and sorrow. Cece went back to school, amazed that her life still existed.\u00a0My mother is dead,\u00a0she told herself, over and over, not immune to its dramatic value. It was precisely this sense of being in a play or a movie that made her death feel temporary. At any minute the play would end and her mother would be alive again, taking her to the beach like she used to every weekend; Cece would massage her head while they watched stupid shows together, dizzy with the smell of sweat and jojoba oil. (That smell! When Cece was little, she used to suck on her mother's hair, put strands of it in her mouth.) Cece missed her so much it howled through her like a wind. She stopped eating. On the soccer field she stood there shivering, staring at the grass. Her friends, understanding at first, eventually gave up on her, stopped asking her to parties and the Galleria, to bonfires at the beach. When her father wasn't home, Cece sometimes sneaked into his room and stripped the mattress, gazing at the orphaned sweat stain, pale as a shadow, where her mother used to sleep.",
      "Once, the phone rang and Cece picked it up: her mother's hair salon asking to confirm an appointment. \"She died,\" Cece said, perhaps too softly to be heard, because the woman on the phone said, \"I believe so, yes. A coloring. Missed the last one, so wanted to confirm.\" The next day, Cece drove to the hair salon and showed up for the appointment. The hairdresser didn't question who she was. He led her to a chair, then grabbed a book of color swatches and handed it to her. Cece flipped through the book\u2014a rainbow of tiny rabbit's feet\u2014and found one that matched her mother's hair. She smelled the swatch, but of course it smelled like nothing. She cried and cried, for the first time since the funeral. The hairdresser, perhaps used to such things, ignored her. He painted and foiled Cece's hair, then rinsed it out and revealed the hideous product of her grief.",

      "I have always longed to be known, truly known, by another human being. Sometimes we live for years with yearnings that we cannot name. Until a crack appears in the sky and widens and reveals us to ourselves, as the pandemic did, because it was during lockdown that I began to sift through my life and give names to things long unnamed. I vowed at first to make the most of this collective sequestering: if I had no choice but to stay indoors, then I would oil my thinning edges every day, drink eight tall glasses of water, jog on the treadmill, sleep long, luxurious hours, and pat rich serums on my skin. But, only days in, I was spiralling in a bottomless well. Words and warnings swirled and spun, and I felt as if all human progress was swiftly reversing to an ancient stage of confusion: don't touch your face; wash your hands; don't go outside; spray disinfectant; wash your hands; don't go outside; don't touch your face. Did washing my face count as touching? I always used a face towel, but one morning my palm grazed my cheek and I froze, the tap water still running. I was alone in my house in Maryland, in suburban silence, the eerie roads bordered by trees that themselves seemed stilled. No cars drove past. I looked out and saw a herd of deer striding across the clearing of my front yard. About ten deer, or maybe fifteen, nothing like the lone deer I would see from time to time chewing shyly in the grass. I felt frightened of them, their unusual boldness, as though my world was about to be overrun not just by deer but by other lurking creatures I could not imagine. My joints throbbed, and the muscles of my back, and the sides of my neck, as if my body knew too well that we are not made to live like this.",
      "In this new suspended life, I one day found a gray hair on my head. It appeared overnight, near my temple, tightly coiled, and in the bathroom mirror I first thought it was a piece of lint. A single gray hair with a slight sheen to it. I unfurled it to its full length, let it go, and then unfurled it again. I didn't pull it out. I thought: I'm growing old. I'm growing old and the world has changed and I have never been truly known. A rush of raw melancholy brought tears to my eyes. This is all there is, this fragile breathing in and out. Where have all the years gone, and have I made the most of life? But what is the final measure for making the most of life, and how would I know if I have?",

      "New Mexico officials have announced the cause of death for actor\u00a0Gene Hackman\u00a0and his wife Betsy Arakawa, a week after they were found dead\u00a0at their home in Santa Fe. Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, and Arakawa died several days before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said Friday.",
      "Investigators had been trying to determine a cause of death for the couple since they died in their home last month.",
      "How did Gene Hackman die?",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their home in a gated community in Santa Fe on Feb. 26, but appear to have died earlier in the month.",
      "Hackman likely died around Feb. 18, when the last activity was detected on his pacemaker, Jarrell said during a Friday news conference.",
      "An autopsy determined that Hackman died of heart disease and also suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. He tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "\"He was in a very poor state of health,\" Jarrell said. \"He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death.\"",
      "Arakawa likely died first, with Feb. 11 being the last time that she was known to be alive, Jarrell said. People with hantavirus infections can initially feel flu-like symptoms for roughly three to six days and then start to have fluid in and around their lungs.",
      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24-48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said. \"It's not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened.\"",
      "Asked if Hackman was aware of his wife's passing, Jarrell said: \"That question's difficult to answer, but I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.\"",
      "There was no food in Hackman's stomach, meaning he had not eaten recently before he died, Jarrell said. She didn't find evidence of dehydration.",
      "Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said there was no indication of a caretaker at the home.",
      "What is hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are found worldwide, carried by rodents and transmitted from animals to humans, Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department, told reporters Friday. The hantavirus found in New Mexico is found throughout the state, primarily in deer mice but in other rodents too, Phipps said.",
      "The hantavirus strain in the Southwest has a mortality rate of about 38%-50%, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be contracted from exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "The various strains in the U.S. aren't transmissible from person to person.",
      "A hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and heart or lung failure, Jarrell said.",
      "The illness is rare, with the state Health Department reporting there were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024. In the last 50 years, officials have identified 136 infections in New Mexico residents, including five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease \u2014 42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal,\" Phipps said. Most infections occur around the home or workplace, she said.",
      "State health investigators conducted a risk assessment of the couple's property Wednesday, Phipps said. While the main residence itself was deemed a low risk for hantavirus exposure, signs of rodent entry were found on other structures on the property, she said.",
      "Investigation into Hackman's and Arakawa's deaths",
      "Mendoza said last Friday there were no apparent signs of foul play in the deaths. The initial findings from the autopsies found no external trauma on either of the bodies, Mendoza said.",
      "Hackman's body was found in a mudroom near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses nearby, according to an affidavit for a search warrant.",
      "The sheriff's office found medication for blood pressure and thyroid issues as well as Tylenol during a search of the home, according to an inventory of the search filed in court. Some pills were scattered on a bathroom countertop near where Arakawa's body was found, according to the affidavit. Mendoza wouldn't say who was prescribed the medication, citing patient privacy laws.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate near Arakawa, while their two other dogs were found alive. Phipps said the dog may have died from dehydration or starvation. Dogs don't get sick from hantavirus, she said.",
      "Investigators also collected two cellphones from the home and a monthly planner, Mendoza said. No surveillance cameras had been found at the home, according to the sheriff.",
      "\"I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family,\" Mendoza said.",
      "The sheriff's office said Tuesday that the company that provides natural gas service for the home made no significant findings after looking for gas leaks and carbon monoxide, the colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal by depriving people from getting enough oxygen. Mendoza said last Friday that both bodies tested negative for carbon monoxide.",
      "Hackman, who won Oscars for his performances in 1971's \"The French Connection\" and the 1992 Western \"Unforgiven,\" was honored at Sunday's Academy Awards in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He received two Oscars, but more importantly, he won the hearts of film lovers all over the world,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman at the awards ceremony. \"Gene always said, 'I don't think about legacy. I just hope people remember me as someone who tried to do good work.' So I think I speak for us all when I say, Gene, you'll be remembered for that and for so much more.\"",

      "Starr will celebrate his longtime love for the genre alongside country greats like Emmylou Harris and Sheryl Crow at the world-famous Ryman Auditorium in Nashville in a new 2-hour concert special called\u00a0\"Ringo & Friends at the Ryman,\"\u00a0airing Monday, March 10 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",

      "So, Burnett decided to write a Gene Autry-inspired song, \"Time On My Hands.\" It would be the catalyst for the album, released in January.",
      "Crossover to country",
      "As a teenager, Starr applied to emigrate from Liverpool to Houston, where his favorite blues singer Lightnin' Hopkins was. Ultimately, he had to scrap the plan, but his failed cross-continent move changed the course of music history. Starr stayed in Liverpool and The Beatles were born.",
      "However, Starr still brought his country roots into the DNA of The Beatles.",
      "One of his first lead vocals for the Beatles was Carl Perkins' country classic \"Honey Don't.\" He also wrote the country rock tune \"Don't Pass Me By\" from the Beatles' 1968 \"White Album.\"",
      "\"I mean, from the beginning you were kind of the country guy in The Beatles really,\" Mason said to Starr.",
      "\"I was,\" Starr said.",
      "A little help from his friends",
      "Jack White, the former frontman of the White Stripes, performed a cover of \"Don't Pass Me By\" at the January concert at the Ryman with Starr.",
      "\"It's a treat for me,\" White said.",
      "The \"White Album\" was the first vinyl he bought when he was just 14 years old.",
      "\"I skipped school and went downtown Detroit and I went into Harmony House Records and I bought the 'White Album' and so for me to be able to sing from that record is pretty cool,\" he said.",
      "Molly Tuttle, who sang on Starr's new album, also played at the Ryman with Starr and Billy Strings.",
      "\"I don't know when I've worked on, like practiced something more. I was like I have to do a good job,\" Tuttle said of the tracks on the album.",
      "Strings said it was an honor to play with Starr \u2013 someone he's admired since he was young.",
      "\"I was spoon-fed that music. I remember my mom showing me the 'White Album' when I was just a little kid and playing it backwards for me and stuff, you know,\" Strings recalled.",
      "Sheryl Crow also joined Starr and company onstage at the Ryman in January.",
      "\"It's easy to forget when you are where you are, that you're getting to play with those people you used to listen to,\" Mason commented to Crow.",
      "\"It is never lost on me,\" Crow replied.",
      "\"Just running through stuff being this close to him, I wanted just, it was like Jesus, I just wanted to touch the cloak, you know what I mean,\" Crow laughed.",

    "story": [
      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",

    "summary": "Trump's tariff policies have rattled the stock market and raised fears of an economic slowdown, increased inflation and a global trade war.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising they would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown, increased inflation and even a global trade war.",
      "The European Union quickly announced it would retaliate with steps that will take effect April 1.",
      "\"As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros ($28 billion),\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. \"We will always remain open to negotiation. We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.\"",
      "France's European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said the EU could go even further, adding that a trade war was in no-one's interests, the Reuters news agency reports.",
      "The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will not only cover steel and aluminum products but textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods as well.",
      "British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said \"all options were on the table\" to respond \"in the national interest,\" according to Reuters.",
      "It also reported that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the Trump move \"entirely unjustified ... and against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship,\" but he ruled out tit-for-tat duties.",
      "\"Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers,\" Albanese told reporters.",
      "Mr. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "The president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \"reciprocal\" rates starting on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\"If you're an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it's the time to expand that assembly line?\" remarked John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Lutnick defends Trump economic policies",
      "In an interview with CBS News Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the president's economic policies are \"worth it,\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "In a\u00a0recent interview\u00a0with Fox News, Mr. Trump declined to rule out that his policies, including increasing tariffs, could cause a recession.",
      "But Lutnick denied that there's any chaos in the way the president has been using tariffs to pressure U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it's chaotic is someone who's being silly,\" Lutnick said.",

The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in those prices over time, has cooled considerably from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but continues to eclipse the index's pre-pandemic levels.",
      "February's data reflects the first full month of the Trump administration, although some of Mr. Trump's economic policies have yet to take effect, such as his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, now set to kick in on April 2 after a one-month reprieve. Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025 due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",

      "Egg prices",
      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "But while egg prices could see some relief in Wednesday's inflation report, food prices are still on the rise, economists say. On a month-over-month basis, food costs likely rose 0.3%, Vanguard said on Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans themselves are bracing for higher grocery costs, according to the March 10 release of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",
      "Consumers bracing for a reignition of inflation could be feeding into a sharp downturn of consumer confidence, which plummeted in February to its lowest level in four years. More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",
      "\"Households expressed more pessimism about their year-ahead financial situations in February, while unemployment, delinquency and credit access expectations deteriorated notably,\" the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. \"Meanwhile, spending growth expectations rose significantly.\"",

    "summary": "The president's tariff announcements have rocked the stock markets and fueled concerns of an economic downturn.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's economic policies Tuesday, saying they are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "\"These policies are the most important thing America has ever had,\" Lutnick told CBS News in an interview when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "But he quickly added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "Mr. Trump in a recent interview with Fox News declined to rule out that his policies, including increasing tariffs, could cause a recession.",
      "\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico and China have rocked the stock markets and fueled concerns of an economic downturn. Canada received some welcome news Tuesday, after Lutnick told CBS News that the U.S. no longer plans to double tariffs against its northern neighbor on aluminum and steel.",
      "Asked whether the president plans to proceed with the 50% tariffs, Lutnick replied, \"No, that's off, too. So, we're at 25% for steel and aluminum because that's where we were.\"",
      "The one- or two-day tariffs that are ultimately withdrawn have their purpose, Lutnick argued.",
      "\"When you're negotiating with someone and they're not paying attention and they're disagreeing, the president, who's the best dealmaker ever to sit in that chair, he's going to say, 'here's my response,'\" Lutnick said. \"And then all of a sudden, shockingly, they respond.\"",
      "Lutnick said the markets will learn to adjust to Mr. Trump's negotiation tactics.",
      "He denied that there's any chaos in the way the president has been using tariffs to pressure U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it's chaotic is someone who's being silly,\" Lutnick said, pointing out that Mr. Trump had warned he'd impose reciprocal tariffs.",
      "As for the sudden announcement of the 50% tariffs on Canada Tuesday morning, Lutnick said, \"He needed to break some guy in Ontario who said he was going to tax American energy 25%. The president of the United States, in the White House says, 'Oh no, you won't,' and breaks him. Breaks him \u2026 by a tweet and a truth (social post). And you think that's chaotic?\"",
      "\"Let the dealmaker make his deals,\" Lutnick said, adding that \"within a short period of time,\" any country negotiating with the U.S. will come to \"realize it doesn't need to do it this way.\"",
      "\"Let's just do it the grown-up way,\" he continued, \"where the biggest economy in the world says, 'I don't like the way you're treating us. How about a little respect? How about a little dignity?'\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-roll-over-an-old-401k/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:38:30 -0400",
    "summary": "If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:24:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The policy could lead to hardship for some elderly Americans, Social Security advocates say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate.",
      "The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check.",
      "But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations \u2014 and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid.",
      "\"People generally do not know they are overpaid \u2014 you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount,\" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How many people get overpayments from Social Security?",
      "Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as \"improper,\" which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars.",
      "From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time.",
      "How do overpayments occur?",
      "The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changesSocial Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changes",
      "Social Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.",
      "And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.",
      "However, there are cases where seniors receive \"strategic overpayments,\" said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit.",
      "In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.",
      "Some seniors decide, \"'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over\" that limit, Weir said.",
      "But seniors who now opt for a \"strategic overpayment\" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added.",
      "When will the new policy go into effect?",
      "The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27.",
      "The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "What happens to Medicare if your Social Security check is clawed back?",
      "Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue.",
      "It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said.",
      "\"If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare,\" Weir said. \"It's a trickle down effect.\"",
      "What if the clawback causes financial hardship?",
      "Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to\u00a0thousands of dollars. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023.",
      "Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through\u00a0SSA form 632, Weir noted.",
      "\"Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay,\" he said.",
      "You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561.",
      "Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.",
      "\"With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it,\" Weir said on his webcast. \"Always appeal everything.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare.",
      "\"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",
      "Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans.",
      "\"The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check.\"",
      "Social Security cuts",
      "The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.",
      "While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out \"fraud\" from the benefit system.",
      "\"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,\" he said. \"We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud,\" he added, referring to a false claim that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits.\"",
      "The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement.",
      "\"Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases,\" the group said.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",

      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:18:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Corrosion issues have been found on what Airbus calls a \"limited population\" of its A220 passenger jets, including some operated by U.S. airlines.",
    "story": [
      "Airbus is investigating corrosion issues on some of its A220 passenger jets. The issue has been found on what the manufacturer calls a \"limited population\" of A220s, including some operated by U.S. airlines. The manufacturer and multiple airlines said the issue does not constitute an immediate safety issue.",
      "\"Regular maintenance checks are scheduled to ensure it is captured early and the right corrective actions are put in place in a timely manner to mitigate the situation,\" an Airbus spokeswoman told CBS News in a statement. \"The A220 fleet's airworthiness remains intact.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the problem said the corrosion has been found on some passenger seat fittings and certain wing components, including what's known as the wing-to-body fairing, which is designed to minimize drag where the wing and body of the plane meet. It essentially acts as an aerodynamic cover over that junction and is not structural in nature.",
      "\"The FAA is aware of the issue and is ensuring airlines address it,\" an agency spokesman confirmed to CBS News in a brief statement.",
      "Delta Air Lines, the world's largest A220 operator, told CBS News it has observed the issue with some passenger seat fittings that require additional inspection and lubrication.",
      "The Atlanta-based carrier said the issue is not impacting scheduled A220 flights and has not resulted in cancellations.",
      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",
      "Because the plane was developed in Canada, it was initially certified by regulators there. The FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency validated the certification but would not typically be the lead agency on an issue like this.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:24:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Southwest Airlines is ending its free checked bags policy for many passengers. Some experts think customer loyalty could suffer.",
    "story": [
      "Southwest Airlines boasts that its passengers' \"bags fly free\" \u2014 but not for long.",
      "Starting May 28 \u2014 just in time for the busy summer travel season \u2014 only Southwest's most elite Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred members and passengers who book their top-tier Business Select fares will receive two free checked bags. Frequent flyer A-List Members, Southwest-branded credit card holders and other select customers will be allowed one checked bag.",
      "Everyone else will be charged for their first and second checked bags on flights booked on or after May 28, the carrier says.",
      "\"Just another airline\"?",
      "It's a break with Southwest's 54 year history \u2014 one that could undermine customer loyalty to the carrier, according to experts.",
      "\"This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty. And this, I think, is going to send Southwest into a financial tailspin,\" airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, of Atmosphere Research Group, told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"Southwest, with these changes, becomes just another airline.\"",
      "Just last September, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge.",
      "\"Bags will still fly free,\" Jordan said. \"It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free, on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free.\"",
      "But when pressed if they'd always fly free, he acknowledged, \"Well, never say never. \u2026 It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change, but from everything that we see, there's no reason to reconsider this at all, especially right now.\"",
      "\"When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it, you are telling almost all of your customers, 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore,'\" Harteveldt said. \"We are watching an airline self-destruct. This is the equivalent of deliberately sailing a ship into an iceberg.\"",
      "The cost of a checked bag hasn't been announced but airline sources say it will be competitive with other carriers.",
      "In comments at a JPMorgan Chase online event, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday that Southwest's baggage policy shift is like \"the slaying of a sacred cow,\" while adding that it could boost the discount carrier's profit margins.",
      "\"I view it as a big deal because it feels more a financially driven, results driven airline than it's ever been before,\" he said.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein, who also spoke at the JPMorgan conference, added that he thinks some Southwest customers could now be \"up for grabs\" because of its move away from free bags.",
      "Mounting financial pressure",
      "The move comes as Southwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has been under intense pressure from an activist investor to improve its financial performance after struggling to keep pace with changing customer preferences post-pandemic.",
      "Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs, launched its first redeye flights, and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead, the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.",
      "Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program \u2014 increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive \"Wanna Get Away\" and \"Wanna Get Away Plus\" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher and lower demand flights.",
      "What's more, starting May 28, Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.",
      "In a video statement Tuesday morning, Jordan said the changes \"will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect, and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want.",
      "\"Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand, a rise in premium demand, and a change in customer preferences.\"",
      "Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future.",
      "\"We are more than the logo on our planes,\" he said. \"Our DNA isn't open seating, or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service.\"",
      "Harteveldt says, \"More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way, and I believe they will, they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing.\"",
      "Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product, which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit.",
      "While the offerings vary by airline, basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment, tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year.",
      "\"Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets \u2014 amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers, a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S., and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members,\" the carrier said in a statement.",
      "But is that the Southwest that people know?",
      "\"Yes,\" Harteveldt said. \"This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful.\"",

    "story": [
      "A surge in retirements is sweeping America as baby boomers enter their golden years. More than 4 million people are poised to turn 65 this year, part of the largest wave of retirement-age Americans in history.",
      "For some, retirement looks different than traditional options. Instead of settling into condos or retirement communities, they're choosing a life at sea.",
      "\"I live at sea and I'm retired,\" says Jo Johnston, who said she has been on \"six or eight cruises of 80 days or longer.\"",
      "For Johnston, a cruise ship is her home.",
      "\"I sold everything that wouldn't fit in my car. And then I sold the car,\" she said.",
      "On board, Johnston gets everything bundled into one package: meals, travel, entertainment and housing, all for approximately $100,000 a year.",
      "\"It's important to really track what you're spending in some way,\" Johnston advises. \"I can tell you last year how much I spent per day on drinks or on short excursions on average.\"",
      "Johnston recently traveled aboard Holland America's \"Grand World Voyage\" cruise from Florida to Grand Cayman. Her 124-day itinerary included Bali, Cape Town and Barcelona.",
      "Lunchtime was spent with friends she's met sailing over the years. None knew each other before cruising.",
      "\"They're so welcoming and they look after you,\" she said about the friends.",
      "The loyal following is one reason why Holland America has launched two of these cruises simultaneously for the first time.",
      "According to the travel site Cruise Critic, more companies are adding longer-haul trips \u2014 voyages lasting three to six months. At least a dozen world cruises are being offered this year alone.",
      "A residential cruise launched last fall, where customers can buy a cabin starting at $130,000.",
      "Charlie Branch, a New York-based financial advisor, says retiring at sea could potentially cost less than retiring on land, \"depending on how you were living when you were on land.\"",
      "Branch said there's a trend of clients becoming more creative about retirement since the pandemic.",
      "\"It's given them some perspective in terms of what they want their lives to look like from this point on,\" he said. \"Some are going and doing things that they've always wanted to do and never had a chance to. We're definitely seeing an uptick in that.\"",
      "As for Johnston, she has cruises booked for the next two years with no plans to stop.",
      "\"I've come to appreciate politics around the world, how people everywhere are more alike than they are not, and just how beautiful the world is,\" she said.",
      "While retirement at sea may sound appealing, a significant factor to consider is health care. Ships typically have a doctor on board who handles basic needs and emergencies, but experts recommend consulting with your primary physician to determine if it's a viable option. As with any retirement plan, proper preparation is essential to ensure you have appropriate medication and care.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As bird flu continues to spread, impacting poultry farms and the price of eggs, the Agriculture Department says it's almost doubling the amount spent to combat it.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a major federal investment to help egg and poultry producers bounce back from bird flu losses, finding eggs at a reasonable price \u2014 or any eggs at all \u2014 remains a tough task for shoppers across the U.S.",
      "In January, egg prices rose 15.2%, and economists say they expect prices to continue to rise this year.",
      "The increase is due to the limited number of hens laying eggs right now. There are fewer hens because of federal bird flu control measures. They require farmers to kill their chickens if they discover a bird flu case in a flock \u2014 a process known as \"culling\" \u2014 to try to prevent the viral disease from spreading.",
      "When farmers cull their flocks to prevent the spread of a disease like the bird flu, they are eligible for public money to help them replace the flocks.",
      "Since 2020, the Department of Agriculture has paid $1.1 billion to hundreds of egg producers who had to cull their flocks to stop bird flu from spreading, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data.",
      "Now, the USDA says it will\u00a0send $400 million more to farmers who need new chickens. The agency also says it will pay $500 million for biosecurity measures and $100 million \"for vaccine research, action to reduce regulatory burdens, and exploring temporary import options.\"",
      "Frank Singleton, a spokesperson for Wayne-Sanderson Farms \u2014 the third largest poultry producer in the nation \u2014 is glad the USDA is helping.",
      "He says his company has 23 plants and 2,000 partner farms in seven states, employing 26,000 people across the Southeast and processing 21 million broiler chickens a week for sale of their meat into the consumer market.",
      "Wayne-Sanderson Farms received more than $600,000 from the USDA's bird flu assistance program to replace three flocks the company culled after discovering bird flu cases in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Singleton says the checks are an important investment to help the farms his company sponsors get back on track.",
      "\"It's a partnership with the farmers, and the consumer, and our company, to make sure we can continue to feed America,\" he says. \"It would be very difficult to get a farmer to take a risk like that without a farm partner like Wayne-Sanderson Farms. So that's where we step in. We make sure that we do our part, our due diligence, help them get back up to speed, and work to make sure those funds are available to them.\"",
      "Culling flocks and shielding them from bird flu",
      "The process of culling is arduous. Singleton says his company sprays a foam agent over the affected chickens to kill them quickly.",
      "\"Different farms and different companies have different methods,\" he said. \"We use a humane method to euthanize all the birds. It's all supervised by regulatory folks and our teams.\"",
      "\"Ours is an approved, USDA-approved method where a foaming agent used, and it's very quick,\" Singleton continued. \"So, those birds have to be disposed of. The house itself has to be cleaned up and sanitized. So it's a long process, and it takes awhile for the farmer to get back up and running. So we work with them directly to make sure that happens.\"",
      "Singleton says there are several proactive measures his company is taking to protect farms from exposure in the first place.",
      "Biosecurity measures are so tight for Wayne-Sanderson Farms, our CBS News cameras were not allowed inside a farm or facility.",
      "\"It just takes one vector to infect a flock so, from the time people come to the farm, using disinfectant sprays, wearing coveralls, wearing personal protective gear, goggles, those kinds of things \u2014 limiting the type of people, the number of people,\" Singleton explained. \"We make sure our people have the equipment, they have the chemicals, the disinfectants, and they have the knowledge. ... It's very critical. Every individual has to do their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.\"",
      "His company supports a recent proposal from other egg and poultry industry leaders to allow broiler eggs \u2014 eggs typically used to hatch chicks \u2014 to be used in consumer products amid the national shortage of traditional eggs.",
      "After a law change in 2009 that stipulated that eggs must be refrigerated sooner if sold into the consumer market, broiler egg producers were no longer able to send excess broiler eggs to consumer companies needing them for things like cakes and pies, because broiler eggs are typically stored at a higher temperature during the first 48 hours prior to shipment.",
      "Singleton says his company throws out 560,000 broiler eggs a week \u2014 about 2% of the total 26 million broiler eggs Wayne-Sanderson Farms produces.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration were to allow the broiler eggs to be used in consumer products, Singleton says, it would be a win-win.",
      "\"We certainly want to do our part to help feed the country and (solve) a need where a need is there; certainly (that) would help us from a waste standpoint and just from employees having to work on that particular aspect of it,\" Singleton said. \"So, it's really just a cost savings and an efficiency savings and putting food back into the marketplace for consumers.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Food and Drug Administration says it is still considering the proposal.",
      "A smaller farm's approach in the bird flu saga",
      "Another company currently able to fill the need is a small independent farm in the northern Alabama city of Madison called Southard Farms.",
      "It has been in co-owner Keith Southard's family for five generations. Southard turned the farm into a pasture-raised poultry, egg and pork production operation in 2019 and never dreamed his business would be booming so soon.",
      "He says over the last month, his phone has been ringing off the hook with restaurants seeking eggs.",
      "\"It's been it's been crazy. It's been busy. My phone rings constantly,\" Southard said. \"Huge, huge opportunity for growth, and people are searching now ... not just to find eggs but something different \u2014 to find good eggs, fresh, local, that they don't just depend on a store to provide them; they know where it's coming from.\"",
      "Southard's father grows grows crops on the farm and they in turn use the crops as feed for his chickens.",
      "He has 900 laying hens for eggs and 700 broiler chickens \u2014 or chickens used for meat.",
      "Right now, Southard's hens lay about 400 eggs a week. A few weeks ago, Southard signed a contract with a restaurant in Birmingham to sell it 500 dozen eggs a week. Southard says he expects his total egg production in the next few months will be just under 1,000 dozen a week to meet the demand.",
      "Unlike in traditional egg farms, where laying hens are kept in an indoor warehouse, Southard's chickens live an outdoor lifestyle, rotating regularly onto fresh grass to graze. He says the pasture-raised format keeps his chickens' immune systems stronger.",
      "\"No medicines needed to keep them going. So, we just use nature's benefits,\" Southard says.",
      "However, the outdoor living could make them more susceptible to coming into contact with wild birds that could be carrying the avian (bird) flu.",
      "\"There's always that risk,\" Southard says. \"We just hope that it doesn't affect us.\"",
      "Last year, Southard had to cull his flock after chickens got hit with a bacterial infection, different than bird flu, called mycoplasma. He says the experience was devastating.",
      "\"I noticed a few symptoms, and then within three days, we went from a normal amount of eggs per day to almost zero, and it was very similar symptoms to the avian flu, so (we) immediately took the hens to the state lab for testing ... and once we got the results in, there really wasn't any answer but to just cull the flock and start over,\" Southard recalled.",
      "He said he and his farmhand had to personally kill each chicken by cutting their throats to make it as quick and painless for the birds as possible.",
      "\"Nothing I want to see again, that's for sure,\" Southard said.",
      "Because mycoplasma is not considered a \"highly-pathogenic\" disease, he did not qualify for the USDA's program to receive a check to help him finance the replacement of his chickens.",
      "\"We just bared through it and kept going,\" Southard says.",
      "And kept going he did.",
      "Southard took us to Farm Burger in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the restaurants that uses his chicken meat and eggs. The staff affectionately calls out, \"The Chicken Man's here!\" upon his arrival to deliver his product in person each week.",
      "The restaurant's co-owner and manager says Southard has been a blessing to his business because Southard has kept his prices low at a time when other restaurants in neighboring states have seen egg prices more than double in the last few months.",
      "Low prices for the restaurant also mean costs don't have to be passed on to customers.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal data found some farms received large checks from the USDA indemnity and reimbursement program after culling their flocks last year \u2014 one egg producer received $10 million.",
      "Asked his thoughts about the taxpayer expense, Southard said, \"I think there's probably, there's definitely a question there about when USDA should get involved or not. So, I think that should be looked into to some more, because obviously we see still these big supply problems. So, I don't think we have the right answer yet, but it should be looked into some more.\"",
      "With supply issues and high egg costs expected at least another year, Southard says it's important to protect small farms.",
      "\"Small farmers like us, family farms, play a key role, because it takes away the big consolidation that's happened and spreads out the risk where you have more farms across the state or country and more farmers,\" Southard says. \"So, if one gets hit, it's not as big of an effect on the whole supply chain.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "The unemployment rate last month was 4.1%, slightly higher than the 4% rate forecast by economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Hiring has eased since December's blowout number of 323,000 new jobs, but the labor market has remained resilient at the start of 2025, experts say.",
      "What it means",
      "The February job figures suggest the labor market \"is showing signs of weakness with hiring across sectors,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual Of America Capital Management, in an email.",
      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",

      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",
      "\"Overall, this report is a sigh of relief for the Fed as they can continue to sit on the sidelines for the next couple meetings as they assess the potential inflation impacts resulting from U.S. tariff policy over the coming months,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email.",
      "Currently, only about 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed to cut rates at its March 19 meeting. About half of those polled are forecasting a rate cut at the Fed's subsequent meeting, scheduled for May 7.",

      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",

They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/auto-tariffs-should-you-buy-a-car-now-2025-prices/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "The Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration are likely to result in higher prices for American consumers and businesses, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",
      "Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.",
      "\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.",

      "Funding public charter schools",
      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",

      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",

      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",

      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday said he is pausing 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",

      "Walgreens Boots Alliance says it has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners as the struggling retailer looks to turn itself around after years of losing money.",
      "Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions.",
      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",
      "The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it.",
      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.",

      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",

And House leaders told members to leave town after the vote, adding to pressure on the Senate to approve the funding measure.",
      "\"We're going to pass the CR,\" Johnson said, while criticizing Democrats for what he called a \"striking new posture\" on government funding. \"We can do it on our own.\"",
      "Johnson could breathe a sigh of relief on Monday night when the House Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-liners who often oppose continuing resolutions on principle, said its members would back the stopgap funding measure.",
      "\"Contrary to Congress' longtime abuse of this legislative tool, this CR is a paradigm shift,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "The group argued in the statement that the stopgap bill would eliminate the need for an omnibus bill, a massive package filled with earmarks that lawmakers often turn to under time pressure to fund the government. And they said that the temporary funding measure will \"reduce and then freeze spending for the next six months to allow President Trump and his Administration to continue their critical work within the Executive Branch to find and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.\" Some of the hard-liners met with Mr. Trump last week at the White House.",
      "The path forward",
      "With the approval in the House, the measure now goes to the Senate, where support from a number of Democrats will be necessary to pass the continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk. Though many Senate Democrats have spoken out against the stopgap measure, some have kept their powder dry \u2014 keeping the door open to preventing a shutdown if no other options are on the table.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wouldn't weigh in on his caucus' stance, saying ahead of the vote on Tuesday that Senate Democrats would \"wait and see what the House does first.\" Senate Democrats are expected to meet Wednesday to determine their next moves.",
      "Democrats have signaled in recent days that they would prefer a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. The top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11 on Monday. But after the House approved the six-month continuing resolution, and with plans to leave town, their options remain limited.",
      "Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, told CBS News that he supports a short-term \"proper\" stopgap measure to continue the appropriations process, adding in response to the House planning to leave town that \"they like to bully and threaten.\"",

      "Ford and Lutnick announced the suspension of the electricity surcharge hours after Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he would double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports from the previous 25% rate to 50%.",
      "Lutnick, asked by CBS News in an interview Tuesday if the president plans to go through with the 50% tariffs, replied, \"No, that's off, too. So, we're at 25% for steel and aluminum because that's where we were.\"",
      "The tariff whiplash began after Mr. Trump's decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and all other countries.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News in a statement that although Mr. Trump had backed off his threat of a 50% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, the 25% tariffs would still take effect Wednesday,\u00a0as announced last month.",

In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\"",
      "Moments after the Ford-Lutnick joint statement was issued, the president told reporters he's considering dialing back the 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports he announced earlier, saying he's \"looking at it\" and could \"make a different decision.\"",

      "The president also called on Canada to drop tariffs on various U.S. dairy products, and said he will be declaring a \"national emergency on electricity\" in the areas affected by Canada's electricity surcharge.

      "\"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,\"\u00a0 the U.S. and Ukraine said in a joint statement released by the State Department. \"The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "The agreement came after more than eight hours of\u00a0negotiations\u00a0between Ukrainian officials and a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Saudi city of Jeddah.",
      "The statement said the U.S. \"will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\" Both were frozen\u00a0in the wake of an explosive meeting between Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Trump at the White House on Feb. 28.",
      "The now-unfrozen military aid includes roughly $1 billion in equipment that was approved by the Biden administration and has not yet been delivered. The Trump administration has the authority to provide another $3.8 billion in aid but has not announced any further aid packages. Ukraine has been buoyed by the U.S. and other Western allies in its fight against Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, and the move to cut off aid left Kyiv at a disadvantage and European allies scrambling.",

And we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace,\" Rubio said. \"The president's objective here is, number one, above everything else, he wants the war to end, and I think today Ukraine has taken a concrete step in that regard. We hope the Russians will reciprocate.\"",
      "The statement from the U.S. and Ukraine said they would each \"name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.\"",
      "It also said Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy would \"conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.\" Washington has been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal which would grant the U.S. access to its mineral reserves, and Zelenskyy indicated his readiness to sign a deal ahead of the talks.",
      "Rubio led the U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia, supported by Witkoff and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Zelenskyy was visiting Saudi Arabia at the time of the talks, but did not participate.",
      "Ahead of the talks, a senior Ukrainian official said his message to the U.S. team was the Kyiv was ready to make a peace deal with Russia, and that while Zelenskyy might still want Western security guarantees as part of the deal to deter any future Russian aggression, the focus was \"how to start this process.\"",
      "Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said his delegation's central message for the U.S. was that \"Ukrainians want a peace,\" and that Ukraine was \"ready to go\" to work toward that goal.",
      "When asked about security guarantees, Yermak said they were \"very important, because we want that never, this aggression, [is] never repeated in the future again.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A pair of federal judges warned Tuesday of continued threats against members of the judiciary amid criticism leveled by Elon Musk and threats of impeachment by Republicans in Congress. They warned such attacks strike at judicial independence.",
      "Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Richard Sullivan, who sit on the federal appeals courts, raised concerns about the increase in threats against judges in a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal judiciary.",
      "Sullivan, who chairs the committee on judicial security, said the protection of judges and federal courthouses around the country is a top priority for the judiciary and recent cuts to the U.S. Marshals Service's budget is a concern. The agency provides security for federal courts and judges.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" he said. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Sutton, meanwhile, said that while the types of threats against judges have evolved over time, they arise directly from the fact that they're doing their jobs.",
      "\"We're supposed to say what the law means, and there's 1,000 federal judges out there, we each take that responsibility seriously,\" he said, adding that judges take an oath to interpret the law neutrally and dispassionately. \"It's a shame to see people attacking judges simply for doing their level best to do their job.\"",
      "Sutton and Sullivan both noted that the justice system allows the losing party to appeal an adverse decision from the trial court to an appeals court and then the Supreme Court.",
      "\"We allocate disappointment to half the people that come before us,\" Sutton said. \"Criticism is no surprise. It's part of the job. But I do think when it gets to the level of a threat, it really is about attacking judicial independence, and that's just not good for the system or the country.\"",
      "Sutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.",
      "The concerns from the two GOP-appointed judges come as Musk and allies of Mr. Trump have attacked judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration. Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"",
      "In a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "The impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",

      "U.S. support for Ukraine is now unclear after a heated Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on one side and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the other.

    "summary": "Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
      "Lawmakers have until the end of the day on Friday, March 14, to fund the government. But it remains to be seen whether House Republicans will be able to muster the near-unanimous GOP support they'll need to pass the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution.",
      "Here's what to know about the funding fight:",
      "What is a government shutdown, exactly?",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding or funding extensions for federal agencies and programs, resulting in a funding gap that prompts federal agencies to shut down projects and activities. During a shutdown, agencies halt nonessential functions until Congress approves funding and the president signs it into law. Essential services, like air traffic control and law enforcement, continue during a shutdown, but workers go without pay until funding is passed. Shutdowns can also disrupt processing of government benefits, loans and applications and shutter national parks.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have used funding deadlines to their advantage in recent decades, leveraging the threat of a government shutdown to pass spending bills with their priorities attached. But lawmakers generally have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the last funding lapse caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "How does Congress fund the government?",
      "Article I of the Constitution gives \u00a0Congress the power to approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "Congress is tasked annually with approving spending bills before the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the president is supposed to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of February, outlining how much the executive branch needs for the coming year. The House and Senate budget committees then go on to pass a budget resolution by the middle of April, before the House begins considering the 12 individual appropriations bills drafted by subcommittees to fund different areas of the government, to be concluded by the end of June.",
      "In recent decades, Congress has hardly ever stuck to that timeline. Instead, lawmakers opt almost every year for continuing resolutions that extend funding before ultimately adopting massive bills, known as omnibus packages, in lieu of the 12 appropriations bills to get the new funding over the finish line. Tucked within those omnibus packages are often policies or programs that wouldn't pass if they were taken up in isolation, making them appealing to some lawmakers.",
      "Currently, Congress is still working on the funding process that was meant to be resolved by October of last year. Lawmakers passed a funding patch just ahead of the deadline in late September, giving themselves three more months to reach an agreement on new government funding and pass appropriations bills. Then in December, Congress approved another extension, setting up the March 14 deadline.",
      "What needs to happen this week to prevent a shutdown?",
      "To fund the government and avert a shutdown, both the House and Senate need to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, extending funding. The measure would then go to President Trump for his signature.",
      "House Republicans unveiled a continuing resolution over the weekend, which would extend government funding through September. The stopgap measure would increase defense spending, along with additional funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. The bill also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The House Rules Committee advanced the measure Monday night, setting up a vote on the floor on Tuesday. Republicans, who have a razor-thin majority in the House, are working to shore up support on the measure, as House Democratic leaders project widespread, if not unanimous, opposition from members of their caucus. Already at least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has pledged to oppose the continuing resolution.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that Massie should be primaried. The president has also been making calls to potential GOP holdouts on the continuing resolution, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "If the House is unable to find the necessary support for the six-month continuing resolution, lawmakers would likely move to a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. Democrats have signaled in recent days that they prefer the latter approach. The top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11 on Monday. The bill would likely find wide bipartisan margins in both chambers, while frustrating conservatives.",
      "Many Democrats have reservations about the six-month stopgap measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. That's because a continuing resolution, unlike regular appropriations bills, lacks a congressional statement of direction on how funds are to be spent by a department or agency. Democrats have also expressed frustration with the spending reductions in the continuing resolution. But Democrats generally aren't inclined to let the government shut down, and House Republicans \u2014 expected to leave town after the stopgap measure passes \u2014 are exerting pressure to avoid a shutdown.",
      "Should the House find enough support to approve the six-month stopgap measure, it would then go to the Senate. But the upper chamber poses its own hurdles. Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, but 60 votes are necessary to propel the bill to passage, meaning support from Democrats will be needed. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "Since the current budget process was enacted in 1976, Congress has prompted 20 funding gaps lasting at least one full day, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Many of those funding lapses were short lived and didn't prompt a shutdown, while a handful have been lengthy funding fights with major political significance and impact. In 2013, a feud over the Affordable Care Act prompted a shutdown. And disagreements over immigration prompted two shutdowns in 2018 \u2014 the second of which marked the most recent government shutdown, and the longest on record.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history started in 2018 and lasted 34 days. The shutdown occurred over an impasse on funding for Mr. Trump's border wall during his first term. But as the fight stretched into the new year, the president signed a bill to reopen the government without his demands being met.",
      "Before the 2018-2019 shutdown, a 1995-1996 shutdown held the record for the longest, at 21 days. The dispute concerned disagreement over spending cuts between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

The same day, a federal judge blocked Khalil's deportation and scheduled a court hearing after Khalil's attorney filed a petition challenging the arrest.",
      "The president wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that his administration \"will not tolerate\" what he said is \"pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American\" activity on college campuses across the country, and claimed the protests are being waged by \"paid agitators\" rather than students. As a student at Columbia University last spring, Khalil helped lead demonstrations protesting Israel and the war in Gaza.",
      "\"We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply.\"",
      "The president said the Saturday night arrest of Khalil is \"the first arrest of many to come.\"",
      "Last year, Khalil and other Columbia students set up an encampment on the school's main lawn to protest the ongoing war in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which Israel launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. More than 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed in the massacre and another 251 were taken hostage. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the fighting since, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, said in a statement that he was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday night. Greer said the ICE agents said Khalil's student visa had been revoked, but Greer noted that he is a U.S. green card holder.",
      "She has since filed a petition on Khalil's behalf challenging his arrest and detention. A federal judge on Monday blocked Khalil's deportation and scheduled a Wednesday conference to discuss the petition.",
      "\"If counsel do not believe a conference is required, and that briefing is appropriate, counsel should propose a briefing schedule (expedited or otherwise) in the joint letter,\" District Judge Jesse Furman wrote. \"To preserve the Court's jurisdiction pending a ruling on the petition, Petitioner shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court orders otherwise.\"",
      "Greer said in her statement that immigration authorities also threatened to arrest Khalil's wife, who is a U.S. citizen and eight months pregnant.",
      "\"We will vigorously be pursuing Mahmoud's rights in court, and will continue our efforts to right this terrible and inexcusable \u2014 and calculated \u2014 wrong committed against him,\" Greer said. \"ICE's arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the U.S. government's open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza. The U.S. government has made clear that they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress that speech.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\" The agency alleged that Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\" but did not provide any details.",
      "\"The remarks by government officials, including the President, on social media only confirm the purpose \u2014 and illegality \u2014 of Mahmoud's detention. He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment,\" Greer said in a statement Monday evening. \"While tomorrow or thereafter the government may cite the law or process, that toothpaste is out of the tube and irreversibly so. The government's objective is as transparent as it is unlawful, and our role as Mahmoud's lawyers is to ensure it does not prevail.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the Trump administration \"will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "An online ICE database states that Khalil is being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana, and lists his birthplace as Syria.",
      "Greer confirmed Khalil's location and said local attorneys would be visiting him Monday and Tuesday. She called his transfer from New York to Louisiana a \"blatantly improper but familiar tactic designed to frustrate the New York federal court's jurisdiction, and isolate Mahmoud far from his lawyers, his home, and his local community of support.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump and his administration have taken numerous steps in response to last year's protests on college campuses and antisemitic incidents.",

      "The Department of Education has also announced investigations into five universities, including Columbia, where there have been reported incidents of antisemitic harassment. On Friday, the Trump administration moved to cancel $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia.",

      "With a history of support for pro-labor policies, Chavez-DeRemer's path to confirmation once appeared threatened. Paul openly opposed her nomination and predicted in January that she'd lose more than a dozen Republican votes. But her confirmation was approved with support on both sides of the aisle Monday.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, a bill that would have made it easier for workers to unionize that was introduced in the last Congress. During her confirmation hearing last month, Chavez-DeRemer addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect,\" while at the same time backing right-to-work laws that allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",
      "Though Paul's opposition threatened to tank Chavez-DeRemer's advancement out of committee last month, three Democrats on the committee ultimately voted to move her nomination forward. And although Democrats haven't been eager to support some of Mr. Trump's nominees amid intense criticism of the administration's work so far, they didn't mount serious opposition to Chavez-DeRemer's confirmation.",
      "Monday's confirmation vote comes after Chavez-DeRemer's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle in a 66-30 vote last week, with 15 Democrats voting with all present Republicans except Paul to advance her nomination.",
      "Though some of her previous views may have conflicted with the administration, Chavez-DeRemer committed during her confirmation hearing to implementing Mr. Trump's policy vision.",
      "\"My guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principle \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced Monday a security clearance review that resulted in the revocations of security clearances for dozens of current and former officials.",
      "Gabbard said in a social media post that the security clearance purge targeted top aides to former President Joe Biden, former intelligence personnel who called a 2020 effort to expose information from Hunter Biden's laptop \"disinformation,\" and some who were involved in legal cases against President Trump.",
      "\"I have revoked security clearances and barred access to classified information for Antony Blinken, Jake Sullivan, Lisa Monaco, Mark Zaid, Norman Eisen, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, and Andrew Weissman, along with the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden 'disinformation' letter,\" Gabbard wrote. \"The President's Daily Brief is no longer being provided to former President Biden.\"",

    "summary": "\"CANCELLED: $600,000 grant to study 'menstrual cycles in transgender men,'\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on X last week. That's not what it was.",
    "story": [
      "Last Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated on X that a $600,000 grant to Southern University in Louisiana was being revoked for studying \"menstrual cycles in transgender men,\" in the latest mischaracterization of a grant that was then canceled by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency team, known as DOGE.",
      "DOGE highlighted the Rollins post, reposting it on the official doge.gov website and on X.",
      "The grant was actually intended for research on the potential health risks posed by synthetic feminine hygiene products and for developing alternatives using natural fibers and fabrics, according to the project's documentation, which was publicly filed on the USDA website.",
      "According to that documentation, the goals of the grant were to develop sustainable feminine hygiene products using regenerative cotton, wool, and industrial hemp while enhancing education through an extension program that teaches women and girls about menstrual health and reusable products. It also would have funded a fiber processing center for locally grown fibers in Louisiana \u2014 potentially benefiting a state with some of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country.",
      "The USDA's decision to cancel the grant appears to have been a result of the grant being flagged to the Trump administration by the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank.",
      "Cailey Myers, a spokesperson for the American Principles Project, said in an email to CBS News, \"This grant clearly denies biological reality \u2014 men don't menstruate,\" but did not provide any evidence the grant funded research into \"menstrual cycles in transgender men.\"",
      "A USDA spokesperson confirmed this reasoning in a statement emailed to CBS News, saying the taxpayer-funded education component of the grant \"prioritized women identifying as men who might menstruate.\"",
      "\"This mission certainly does not align with the priorities and policies of the Trump Administration, which maintains that there are two sexes: male and female,\" the statement said.",
      "While the grant language does include a single sentence acknowledging that transgender men are among those who menstruate, there was no indication that they were the focus of the grant or even part of it. The passing reference to transgender men in the original grant application appears to be the sole justification for its cancellation.",
      "The description of the grant's goals, objectives and project methods contains no mention of prioritizing transgender men and focuses solely on the development of menstrual products made from natural fibers. The grant repeatedly notes that it would focus on efforts to \"educate young women and adolescent girls\" about menstrual hygiene products.",
      "The USDA, asked in a follow-up question whether it had any evidence that the study prioritized transgender men, did not respond.",
      "The true purpose of the project, according to the grant, was to \"address the growing concerns and issues surrounding menstruation, including the potential health risks posed to users of synthetic feminine hygiene products.\"",
      "According to 2022 study published in the journal Current Environmental Health Reports, there have only been limited studies on the risks of environmental contamination from synthetic hygiene products, despite the potential for toxic chemical exposure. Some of the concerns include whether exposure to heavy metals and PFAS chemicals could be harmful or cancer causing.",
      "Dr. Samii Kennedy Benson, who oversaw the program, told the local NBC affiliate WVLA the program held potential for U.S. farmers.",
      "\"Our local fiber processing facility will benefit local farmers who often grow fibers on a smaller scale and so we'll also have that ability to provide something local,\" Benson said.",
      "CBS affiliate WAFB in Baton Rouge also covered the project.",
      "In an email, Benson told CBS News that she received notification her grant had been canceled on Saturday but had not been aware of why until contacted by CBS News.",
      "Southern University, which is a public historically Black land-grant university in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told CBS News \"the term 'transgender men' was only used once to state that this project, through the development of safer and healthier FHPs [feminine hygiene products], would benefit all biological women.\"",
      "A statement from Southern University said the grant was reviewed by researchers from throughout the country before going forward.",
      "Although the overall dollar amount of the grant is small in the larger context of government spending, it was posted by a Trump Cabinet secretary and re-shared by DOGE. As a result, the tweets reached over 5 million people on X by Sunday evening. It was also covered by Fox News and other conservative outlets.",
      "Since DOGE first began posting to its \"wall of receipts,\" news organizations have found numerous mistakes in both the claims of money saved and the descriptions of programs being shut down.",
      "In one instance, a contract was alleged to have been worth $8 billion, but was in fact worth just $8 million. Additionally, hundreds of millions of contracts and grants have been removed from the \"wall of receipts\" after reporters exposed errors including double or triple postings of the same contract.",
      "DOGE has also claimed credit for the sale of a building in Washington, D.C., that was sold at auction under the Biden administration.",
      "Hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts have been canceled due to inclusion of phrases or words that the Trump administration believes are associated with diversity, equity or inclusion, or DEI \u2014 initiatives Mr. Trump is seeking to ban by executive order \u2014 or for conflicting with his executive order declaring that the federal government recognizes only \"two sexes, male and female.\""

DOGE is supposed to be tasked with eliminating government waste and posted in February a \"wall of receipts\" outlining the money allegedly saved by cutting government programs. CBS News has found that the \"wall of receipts\" contained multiple errors, and DOGE's purges have faced numerous challenges in court.",

In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",

      "In early February, two top security officials were placed on administrative leave after they refused to allow DOGE access to classified information, sources confirmed to CBS News. Matt Hopson, tapped by Mr. Trump to be USAID chief of staff just two weeks earlier, resigned shortly afterward and USAID's website went dark. By the end of that week, nearly all of the agency's staff were put on administrative leave and all of its overseas staff were ordered to be shuttered.",
      "Meanwhile, a USAID deputy administrator was put on administrative leave in February for issuing memos saying the agency had failed to implement humanitarian assistance due to \"political leadership\" at the agency and DOGE.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order his first day in office that froze federal funding for foreign assistance for 90 days amid a review of foreign aid, although the State Department later issued a waiver for \"life-saving \"life-saving humanitarian assistance,\" defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",

    "summary": "The dispute will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a challenge to state and local laws that ban so-called \"conversion therapy\" for LGBTQ children.",
      "The dispute before the court arose out of a Colorado law that prohibits licensed mental health professionals from engaging in conversion therapy on children who may be questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity. More than 20 states and the District of Columbia have similar laws on the books. The case will be heard in the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October. A decision is expected by the end of June 2026.",
      "Colorado enacted the Minor Conversion Therapy Law in 2019 following what the state said was a growing mental health crisis among young people in the state and \"mounting evidence\" that conversion therapy is tied to increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.",
      "The law prohibits \"any practice or treatment [upon minors] \u2026 that attempts or purports to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"",
      "The state joined more than a dozen others in disciplining mental health professionals who practice conversion therapy on minors. Those who are found to engage in this practice face a range of punishments, from fines to a letter of admonition to having their license revoked.",
      "The challenge to Colorado's law was brought by Kaley Chiles, a professional counselor who is licensed by the state and uses talk therapy in her practice. A practicing Christian, Chiles works with adults and young people, and many of her clients are also Christian.",
      "According to court papers, some of Chiles' clients seek Christian-based counseling \"to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\"",
      "Chiles' sued the state of Colorado in September 2022 and sought to block enforcement of the state's restriction on conversion therapy. She argued that the measure violates her free speech rights under the First Amendment and censors her conversations with clients based on viewpoint.",
      "A federal district court declined to block the law, finding that it regulates professional conduct that incidentally involves speech. The court also found that conversion therapy is \"ineffective and harms minors.\"",
      "Chiles' appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which upheld the lower court's decision. The 10th Circuit said that the restriction on conversion therapy implicates speech solely as to the practice of mental health treatment, which can be licensed by the state. The appeals court also concluded that Colorado's law advances its interests in protecting minors and the integrity of the mental health profession.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for Chiles argued that she does not seek to \"cure\" her clients of same-sex attractions or change their sexual orientation. Instead, they said she aims to help her clients \"with their stated desires and objectives in counseling, which sometimes includes clients seeking to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with one's physical body.\"",
      "\"Colorado disagrees with Chiles's beliefs on gender and sexuality. So much so that the State puts itself in Chiles's counseling room, forbidding her from discussing the values she and her clients share,\" her lawyers wrote in a Supreme Court filing. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group.",
      "But Colorado officials said that the First Amendment allows states to regulate professional conduct to protect patients from \"substandard treatment,\"even when that rule \"incidentally\" burdens speech. They argued that efforts to change a young person's sexual orientation or gender identity are \"unsafe and ineffective.\"",
      "\"A professional's treatment of her patients and clients is fundamentally different, for First Amendment purposes, from laypersons' interactions with each other,\" Colorado officials wrote in a filing. \"Unlike laypersons, those who choose to practice as health professionals are required, among various other responsibilities, to provide treatment to their patients consistent with their field's standard of care.\"",
      "The state argued that Chiles' claim undercut the ability of states to protect patients and clients from \"harmful professional conduct.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked before to jump into the debate over conversion therapy, but had previously declined to intervene. In 2023, the court turned away a First Amendment challenge to a Washington state law that prohibits licensed therapists from performing conversion therapy on patients under the age of 18.",

The states claim that oil and gas companies engaged in deceptive marketing by misrepresenting the dangers of their fossil fuel products, which caused consumers to use more of them.",
      "The oil and gas companies sought to move nearly all the cases to federal court, arguing that federal law governs interstate emissions, but the efforts were rejected by U.S. courts of appeals.",

They asked the high court to block the civil suits filed by the Democratic-led states and prevent other litigation seeking similar relief in the future.",
      "The red states allege that the claims pending in state court seek to regulate activity outside of the blue states' borders and involve an area governed by federal law.",
      "They argued in a Supreme Court filing that the blue states are seeking \"massive\" penalties and relief against energy producers that are not based in their states. If the Democratic-led states succeed, they warned it would have sweeping impacts on the national energy system.",
      "\"If defendant states are right about the substance and reach of state law, their actions imperil access to affordable energy everywhere and inculpate every state and indeed every person on the planet,\" the red states wrote. \"Consequently, defendant states threaten not only our system of federalism and equal sovereignty among States, but our basic way of life.\"",
      "But the attorneys general for the blue states told the court\u00a0that their state-court actions seek to address local harms resulting from allegedly unlawful deceptive conduct by the oil and gas companies.",

      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",

      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

      "SpaceX launched its huge Starship rocket on the program's eighth test flight Thursday, but a malfunction of some sort triggered multiple upper stage engine shutdowns and the vehicle failed to reach its planned sub-orbital altitude, breaking apart in a spectacular shower of debris.",
      "It was the second failure in a row for a Starship upper stage, a vehicle critical to NASA's plans to return astronauts to the moon in the next few years.",
      "\"During Starship's ascent burn, the vehicle experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly and contact was lost. Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses,\" SpaceX said in a statement.",
      "\"We will review the data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.\"",

      "Telemetry indicated the fire broke out after propellant lines leading to one of the Raptors ruptured due to unexpected harmonic vibrations. SpaceX carried out a 60-second engine test firing of the Starship launched Monday, studying responses to various thrust levels.",
      "Based on the test results, propellant feed lines were modified, fuel temperatures were changed and thrust levels were adjusted to avoid any such harmonic responses.

      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",

      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "The full moon reaches peak illumination at 2:55 a.m. ET on Friday, March 14. The total lunar eclipse will make the moon appear red on Thursday, March 13 into the following day, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "When and where to see the \"Blood Worm Moon\"",
      "While this month's full moon will rise early Friday, it will appear full from around Wednesday evening into Saturday morning, according to NASA. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday night at 11:57 p.m. EDT. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",

      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "This month's full moon is also called the Worm Moon. The nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

      "A federal appeals court has tossed an Amarillo woman's death sentence after it found that local prosecutors had failed to reveal that their primary trial witness was a paid informant.",
      "With a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals last week sent Brittany Marlowe Holberg's 1998 murder conviction back down to the trial court to decide how to proceed.",
      "Holberg has been on death row for 27 years. In securing her conviction in 1998, Randall County prosecutors heavily relied on testimony from a jail inmate who was working as a confidential informant for the City of Amarillo police. That informant recanted her testimony in 2011, but neither a Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or a federal district court found that prosecutors had violated Holberg's constitutional right to a fair trial.",
      "The appeals court disagreed, saying that the informant was critical to the jury's determination of guilt and that the prosecution violated Holberg's due process rights by hiding information that, according to a landmark U.S. Supreme court ruling called the Brady doctrine, must be disclosed. Writing for the majority, judge Patrick E. Higginbotham cast Holberg's case as a blight on the criminal justice system.",
      "A federal appeals court has reversed an Amarillo woman\u2019s death sentence after it found that local prosecutors had failed to reveal that their primary trial witness was a paid informant. >>> https://t.co/w6VqpILI3K pic.twitter.com/ljsAGno3by",
      "\"We pause only to acknowledge that 27 years on death row is a reality dimming the light that ought to attend proceedings where a life is at stake, a stark reminder that the jurisprudence of capital punishment remains a work in progress,\" wrote Higginbotham, a Ronald Reagan appointee.",
      "Holberg was sentenced to death by an Amarillo jury when she was 23 years old. The jury found her guilty of murdering A.B. Towery, an 80-year-old man and former client of Holberg, a sex worker. During trial, Holberg asserted that she acted in self-defense and that she stabbed Towery because she feared for her life and sought to protect herself after he struck her on the back of the head and refused to relent.",
      "The prosecution, however, presented testimony from Holberg's jail cellmate Vickie Marie Kirkpatrick, who alleged that Holberg had admitted to killing Towery \"in order to get money\" and said she \"would do it all over again for more drugs.\"",
      "Kirkpatrick was at the time working as a confidential informant for the City of Amarillo police, a fact prosecutors did not disclose. They instead presented Kirkpatrick as a \"disinterested individual who 'wanted to do the right thing,'\" Higginbotham wrote.",
      "\"Ms. Holberg's 27 years on death row is a showcase of the State's failure to abide by a core structure of prosecution: the Brady doctrine,\" Higginbotham wrote.",
      "Holberg had experienced severe and repeated sexual abuse during her childhood and fell into a crack cocaine addiction. She turned to sex work to support her addiction, according to court documents.",
      "On Nov. 13, 1996, she had a minor traffic accident and then sought refuge in Towery's apartment. A heated argument turned violent, leaving Towery dead with part of a lamp lodged within his throat. Holberg left the apartment cut, bruised and bleeding from her head where Towery struck her.",
      "While in jail, the Randall County District Attorney's Office approached multiple inmates to question them about Holberg, offering them a deal in exchange for testimony. Kirkpatrick, who was placed in the same cell as Holberg, produced a statement detailing an alleged admission from Holberg. That same day, Kirkpatrick was released on bond.",
      "In a lone dissent, circuit judge Stuart Kyle Duncan, a Donald Trump appointee, wrote that the jury did not solely rely on Kirkpatrick's testimony to reach their decision of guilt.",
      "\"The jury was presented with graphic physical evidence that Holberg sadistically butchered a sick old man-with a lamp rammed down his throat as the coup de gr\u00e2ce,\" Duncan wrote. \"That evidence doomed Holberg's self-defense theory and there is no chance that impeaching Kirkpatrick would have resurrected it.\"",
      "Randall County District Attorney Robert Love, who was the assistant district attorney when Holberg's case was first prosecuted, said in an emailed statement that he was \"disappointed\" by the 5th Circuit's ruling. He declined to comment further on the case until the Texas Office of the Attorney General decides how to proceed. \"They are currently discussing the legal options available,\" Love said.",
      "Holberg's attorneys didn't immediately respond to The Texas Tribune's request for comment on Monday. A Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson said the agency had no comment on Holberg's case. Holberg is currently being held at the Patrick L. O'Daniel Unit, a Gatesville prison that houses females on death row, among other inmates.",
      "Texas leads the country in executions and is among the top three in imposing death sentences. The state's use of capital punishment has waned, however, and the number of people on death row has dropped by more than half over the past twenty five years. There are 174 people on Texas' death row, and seven of them are women.",
      "According to CBS affiliate KFDA-TV, Holberg is currently being held at the Patrick L. O'Daniel Unit, a Gatesville prison that houses women on death row.",
      "One of those inmates is Melissa Lucio, who has been on death row in Texas since 2008 in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Mariah. Last November, the judge who presided over Lucio's murder trial ruled there was clear and convincing evidence that Mariah died from an accidental fall, and said Lucio \"is actually innocent.\"",

    "summary": "U.K. police say the Solong cargo ship's captain, identified by the vessel's owner as a Russian national, was detained on suspicion of negligent manslaughter.",
    "story": [
      "British police on Tuesday arrested the captain of a cargo ship on suspicion of manslaughter as they searched for answers about why it\u00a0hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military\u00a0off eastern England a day earlier, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor was presumed dead in the collision.",
      "Humberside Police said the 59-year-old was detained \"on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.\" He wasn't named by the police and has not been charged.",
      "Shipping company Ernst Russ, the owner of the Portugal-flagged container carrier the Solong, said the arrested man was the ship's master, whom the firm identified on Wednesday as a Russian national. It said he \"and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations.\"",
      "The company said the ship's 14 crew members were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.",
      "U.K. authorities have said they don't suspect foul play in the collision.",
      "An American crew member of the U.S.-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker who anonymously spoke to CBS News because he wasn't permitted to speak with media about the crash said the vessel had been anchored on the spot where the collision occurred. The tanker had relayed its coordinates, the man said, meaning all other vessels in the area should have known its position.",
      "The crew member said the Solong\u00a0\"came out of the blue\"\u00a0and struck the Stena.",
      "He said he was near to the part of the Stena where the Solong made its impact, and that he had only seconds to react when he heard shouts to brace before impact.",
      "The government said the cause of the collision was being investigated. There was no indication of foul play, but it sparked fears of significant environmental damage.",
      "U.K. officials were watching for damage to birds and sea life after jet fuel poured into the North Sea when the Solong broadsided the Stena Monday. The collision sparked explosions and fires that burned for more than 24 hours.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News Monday that the Stena was carrying cargo in support of the Defense Department. The collision did not impact operations or combat readiness, the official said.",
      "Footage filmed from a helicopter on Tuesday morning showed the fire appeared to largely be out on the Stena, which had a large gash on its port side.",
      "The U.K. coast guard agency said Tuesday that the Solong was still alight. It said the cargo ship, whose front end was crushed and blackened, was drifting south, away from the tanker, and an approximately half-mile exclusion zone had been put in place around both ships.",
      "\"No sign of pollution from vessels is observed at this time,\" British Transport Minister Mike Kane told lawmakers in the House of Commons.",
      "The government said air quality readings were normal and the risk to public health onshore was \"very low.\"",
      "Kane initially said the Solong was expected to sink, but the government said later that both vessels were likely to stay afloat.",
      "The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea.",
      "All but one of the 37 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore in the port of Grimsby, about 150 miles (north of London, with no major injuries. One crew member was missing, and the coast guards called off the search late Monday.",
      "\"Our working assumption is that, very sadly, the sailor is deceased,\" Kane said.",
      "The U.K. Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun gathering evidence of what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth, Scotland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored about 10 miles off the English coast.",
      "The investigation will be led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.",
      "The 596-foot Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. Its operator, U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, said that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel in 16 tanks, at least one of which was ruptured.",
      "The company said it was unclear how much fuel had leaked into the sea.",
      "The North Sea is home to a number of protected marine animals, as well as vital fishing stocks for the U.K. and other European countries.",
      "Oceana U.K. believes the collision took place near two protected areas in particular, including the Southern North Sea marine protected area, which is designated to protect the harbor porpoise, according to Naomi Tilley, the Oil and Gas Campaign Lead at Oceana U.K., an environmental group focused on oceans.",
      "\"It's a really important area of breeding and a really large portion of the global population is found in that area,\" she told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The owner of the Solong said that contrary to earlier reports, the vessel wasn't carrying containers of sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water. It said that four empty containers had previously contained the chemical.",
      "\"Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with cleanup teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Greenpeace U.K. said it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage from the collision, which took place near busy fishing grounds and major seabird colonies.",
      "Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.",
      "Tom Webb, senior lecturer in marine ecology and conservation at the University of Sheffield, said that wildlife along that stretch of coast \"is of immense biological, cultural and economic importance.\"",
      "Alex Lukyanov, who models oil spills at the University of Reading, said the environmental impact would depend on multiple factors, including \"the size of the spill, weather conditions, sea currents, water waves, wind patterns and the type of oil involved.\"",
      "\"This particular incident is troubling because it appears to involve persistent oil, which breaks up slowly in water,\" he said. \"The environmental toll could be severe.\"",

      "They run businesses. They tend bars. They pay taxes. While they are in the U.S. illegally, they are largely spared the scrutiny of that label. But still they live in fear. They are the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants in America today.",
      "Recent estimates from the Irish government suggest that there are as many as 10,000 undocumented Irish immigrants across the United States. Many have lived in the shadows for decades, waiting for a pathway to citizenship that may never come. And with a new president that has vowed to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, anxieties have been heightened.",
      "\"It's definitely a concern, definitely a worry,\" Mary, an undocumented Irish immigrant in New England, told CBS News. \"I've heard of different people, you know, getting caught up in a swoop of undocumented people \u2014 some of them may be criminals, but some of them may not be, and it's just a situation of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"",
      "Mary, and others interviewed for this story, asked that their full names not be used to maintain their anonymity.",
      "Irish privilege?",
      "While Mary fears for her own status, she says communities of color are bearing the brunt of President Trump's immigration crackdown while she can somewhat fly under the radar.",
      "\"There's some very hardworking people that have set up businesses and are employing people and all of a sudden, you know, they're on a plane somewhere, their lives have changed, and it's very hard,\" she said. \"I absolutely do feel for people.\"",
      "Aisling, an undocumented Irish waitress in Chicago, who has lived in America for eight years, says that while she is concerned she may become a \"collateral damage\" target for the administration, ICE raids in her neighborhood have targeted predominantly Latino communities \u2014 something she has condemned as racist.",
      "\"If ICE were to walk into my work, I could definitely just blend in with the crowd, but the fear for me is getting pulled over or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" she told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment as to how ICE conducts its enforcement operations and whether the characterization that they are specifically targeting Hispanic and Latino communities is a fair one.",
      "Mick, who arrived in New York from Ireland in 2000, said public treatment of Irish people in the U.S. was in many ways the opposite of what other nationalities face. \"I used to find it quite unfair hearing how locals would speak about these immigrants coming here,\" he explained. \"I'd have to remind them, say, 'Hey guys, I'm an immigrant.'\" The attitude, he said, was, \"'Yeah, but you're different.'\"",
      "Mick was undocumented for the first few years he lived in the U.S., but he is now a citizen and describes himself as a proud New Yorker. He said there was a \"much broader fear\" among immigrant communities now during the second Trump administration.",
      "\"There's tips being posted online \u2026 for people to report businesses if they suspect there's undocumented people working. It's horrible. There's definitely a feeling here, which is new and not nice,\" he said.",
      "Ciara, who arrived in the U.S. before President Trump took office, said she was on a J-1 visa, which allows for educational and cultural exchange, but working illegally on the side. \"There is a bit of a safety net\" for Irish people in the hospitality industry, she said.",
      "\"It definitely is a worry, but I think I am definitely very privileged as well. I'm a White Irish girl with a third-level [college] education, so I think I'm in a lot more secure position to a lot of other people who are undocumented.\"",
      "But immigration attorneys have told CBS News that it would be naive for Irish undocumented people to believe that they may be immune to deportation.",
      "\"When Irish people come here, they come on what we call the visa waiver program, so that allows them to come to the United States without going to the consulate in Dublin, and they can come in for 90 days and stay for 90 days, and so most of them [who are undocumented] overstay,\" John Foley, a Boston-based immigration attorney told CBS News.",
      "\"The waiver part means they waive all rights to judicial processing, meaning they can be removed or deported from the United States without going in front of a judge,\" Foley said. \"If you're an ICE officer and you need to get 40 people a week, it's Thursday and you're at 27, you don't care where the last 13 come from.\"",
      "Contribution to the American economy",
      "Tom, a New York bar owner and legal resident in Manhattan, told CBS News that he has employed many undocumented Irish workers as well as undocumented Central and South American staff in his pub over the years. He says he couldn't operate as a business owner without them.",
      "\"I'd say 90% of the restaurants and small businesses in this city would close down if you took away the [undocumented] immigrants,\" Tom said. \"The folks who want to do those jobs are people that don't have clear legal paths into America.\"",
      "An estimate from the American Immigration Council showed that undocumented immigrants in America contributed $75.6 billion in taxes in 2022. That included $29 billion in state and local taxes and $46.6 billion in federal taxes.",
      "Aisling, in Chicago, says her colleagues at the bar where she works are predominantly undocumented.",
      "\"The business relies on it, basically \u2026 people coming in applying for jobs here, it's not Americans coming in and applying. They don't want to do these jobs,\" she said.",
      "Legal pathways for undocumented immigrants are limited",
      "Mary, in New England, arrived in the U.S. in 1999. In the 26 years that she has lived in America, she has become a property owner and is self-employed.\u00a0 For the past 14 years, she has been trying to obtain sponsorship for legal residency through a legal petition from her brother, who is an American citizen. That process is still pending with no end in sight.",
      "\"There isn't really any opportunities,\" she said. \"There isn't a path right now for me.\"",
      "It's an issue facing many undocumented immigrants working in the United States today, where few legal pathways exist, and where they do, massive backlogs and bureaucracy cause long processing delays.",
      "A 2023 policy analysis\u00a0from the conservative think tank the Cato Institute said that fewer than 1% of people who want to move permanently to the United States can do so legally.",
      "One young Irish woman who overstayed her visa waiver in New York and is now working in a bar in Manhattan told CBS News that she just wants to work, but the avenues are limited.",
      "\"I would prefer to be legal and have legal status, but it was hard in general to get a visa, and I feel like now, it's 10 times harder to even consider trying to get a visa,\" she said.",
      "Mick, who eventually obtained citizenship, said he would support amnesty for people without criminal convictions who are living illegally in the U.S. and contribute to communities.",
      "\"A lot of the people who are coming to our countries and our shores are coming here because of policies that we've allowed to happen and that have benefited us for decades,\" he said. \"I feel like we should be looking after people who need help the most.

      "Americans hoping for good news on inflation with Wednesday's release of Consumer Price Index data for February may have to wait a little longer for relief.",
      "Prices across the U.S. likely rose 2.9% last month from a year ago, which would remain well above the Federal Reserve's target of a 2% annual rate, according to the average estimate from economists polled by FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in those prices over time, has cooled considerably from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but continues to eclipse the index's pre-pandemic levels.",
      "February's data reflects the first full month of the Trump administration, although some of Mr. Trump's economic policies have yet to take effect, such as his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, now set to kick in on April 2 after a one-month reprieve. Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025 due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",
      "The ongoing rise in food prices is posing a challenge to some U.S. households, particularly among lower-income consumers who spend a greater share of their income on groceries than higher-earning Americans, according to a new Bank of America Institute analysis of consumer spending.",
      "Egg prices",
      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "But while egg prices could see some relief in Wednesday's inflation report, food prices are still on the rise, economists say. On a month-over-month basis, food costs likely rose 0.3%, Vanguard said on Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans themselves are bracing for higher grocery costs, according to the March 10 release of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",
      "Consumers bracing for a reignition of inflation could be feeding into a sharp downturn of consumer confidence, which plummeted in February to its lowest level in four years. More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",

      "Washington\u2014Some U.S. Agency for International Development employees have been directed to clear out classified safes and personnel documents from the Ronald Reagan Building, where the agency is housed, and shred or burn the records, according to two sources' screenshots of an email sent to USAID staff and obtained by CBS News.",
      "USAID staffers received an email from USAID acting executive secretary Erica Carr directing them to clear out classified safes and personnel documents, beginning at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. The shredding instruction regarding sensitive documents was first reported by ProPublica.",
      "\"Shred as many documents first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes unavailable or needs a break,\" the email reads. If you need to use the burn bags, do not overfill, and ensure the burn bag can be closed with staples at the top. The only labeling required on the burn bags are the words 'SECRET' and 'USAID/(B/IO)' in dark sharpie if possible. If you need additional burn bags or sharpie markers, please let me or the SEC InfoSec team know.\"",
      "The documents being ordered destroyed could be evidence for multiple court filings against the Trump administration and the government aid agency, one source familiar with the instructions about the handling of USAID records told CBS News.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said on social media, \"The USAID building will soon be occupied by CBP,\" and that the email was sent to \"roughly three dozen employees.\" She claimed the documents being destroyed were \"old, mostly courtesy content (content from other agencies), and the originals still exist on classified computer systems.\"",
      "An administration official told CBS News that today's actions were part of the process for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to be housed in that building, to clean up the work spaces involved in the transfer. The official also echoed what Kelly said about the content of the documents.",
      "Of the roughly three dozen USAID staff who received the email, all had a Secret level security clearance or higher, and none were on administrative leave, the official told CBS News. The staffers were all appointed by the departments that the documents pertained to, and any documents from a particular bureau or office that didn't have someone who met those specific requirements to handle them were being held accordingly, according to the official.",
      "The official said the move was \"fully compliant\" with the Federal Records Act.",
      "USAID staff also received another email around midday, Tuesday, instructing them to come by the USAID annex offices in Washington this Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to retrieve personal belongings. The email obtained by CBS News reads, \"Staff will be given 15 minutes to complete this retrieval and must be finished removing items within their time slot only.\" The email also appears to contradict the other email on how records should be handled.",
      "\"While collecting their items, staff must ensure that proper records management practices are employed when identifying and/or disposing records, pursuant to the Federal Records Act and ADS 502,\" the email said.",
      "On Tuesday, Democracy Forward and Public Citizen Litigation Group filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order to stop what they called the unlawful destruction of federal records at USAID.",
      "The State Department has so far not responded to CBS News' requests for comment on either the email or the list of USAID grants that have been terminated by the State Department. On Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tweeted from his personal X account confirming that 83% of USAID programs have been canceled.",
      "In response to a question from CBS News on if and when the full list of terminated grants will be made available to the public during last week's State Department press briefing, spokesperson Tammy Bruce said she did not yet have an answer on this. She added, \"It's important, because many Americans have questions about the nature of the details of what's happening.\""

      "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 A federal judge has halted Louisiana's first death row execution using nitrogen gas, which was scheduled to take place next week.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Shelly Dick issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday, stopping the state from immediately moving forward with the execution, which would have been Louisiana's first in 15 years. Attorney General Liz Murrill said the state will immediately appeal the decision.",
      "In her ruling, Dick said the court is tasked with answering the question: \"Is nitrogen hypoxia cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment?\"",
      "Dick went on to say that it is in the public's interest to halt the execution until the matter can \"be resolved at a trial on the merits\" and that the injunction is especially of public interest if it prevents \"the violation of constitutional rights.\" She added that it is not a question of whether Jessie Hoffman Jr. will be executed, but rather how.",
      "Last month, Hoffman filed a lawsuit against the state and sought to block his March 18 execution date. During a hearing last week, attorneys for Hoffman argued that the execution method of nitrogen hypoxia is cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution and infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice his religion, specifically Buddhist breathing and meditation exercises.",
      "They also said the execution protocol lacks transparency, noting that under the policy, Hoffman's attorneys do not fall under the list of \"required witnesses\" to the execution.",
      "Louisiana has three approved execution methods, including lethal injection as the default and electrocution and nitrogen hypoxia as alternatives.",
      "Cecelia Kappel, Hoffman's attorney, applauded Dick's ruling and said that she looks forward to presenting the evidence that that nitrogen hypoxia would inflict \"torture on Jessie at the time of his death.\"",
      "U.N. experts have said execution by nitrogen hypoxia could \"result in a painful and humiliating death\" and likely violates international bans on torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading punishment.",
      "The execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith, the first person put to death by nitrogen hypoxia, was described as prolonged, horrific and torturous by some witnesses, including journalists, who said he writhed and thrashed for several minutes on the gurney once the nitrogen system switched on.",
      "At a media briefing once he was pronounced dead, Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm called the execution\u00a0\"textbook,\"\u00a0even though it had never been done.",
      "Hoffman, who did not challenge his conviction or sentence during the hearing, asked that he be put to death using a \"humane\" method. He asked to be executed by a firing squad or consuming a drug cocktail typically used for physician-assisted death, but neither of those methods is approved by Louisiana law.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that nitrogen hypoxia has proven to be successful in Alabama, saying the method is seemingly painless and an approved method under Louisiana law.",
      "Republican officials, including Gov. Jeff Landry and Murrill, say the state is long overdue in delivering justice that has been promised to the families of victims.",
      "Hoffman, 46, was convicted of the 1996 murder of Mary Elliott in New Orleans.",
      "Murrill told The Associated Press last month that she expects at least four people will be executed this year. There are 56 people on Louisiana's death row.",
      "Louisiana is following in the footsteps of Alabama, which has executed four people using nitrogen gas. In January 2024, Smith, a former death row inmate, was the first inmate to die by\u00a0nitrogen hypoxia, a controversial and at the time untested method that prompted\u00a0legal pushback\u00a0and public scrutiny from critics within the United States and abroad.",
      "During last week's hearing, state officials described Louisiana's execution protocol using nitrogen gas to be nearly identical to Alabama's.",
      "Under the protocol, the subject is strapped to a gurney, forced to breathe pure nitrogen gas through a mask placed on their face, depriving them of oxygen. The procedure is a relatively new alternative to more common forms of capital punishment, such as lethal injection and electrocution, which are the two methods used most prevalently across the U.S.,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Death Penalty Information Center.",

      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

      "Sutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.",
      "The concerns from the two GOP-appointed judges come as Musk and allies of Mr. Trump have attacked judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration. Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"",
      "In a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "The impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" Sutton said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Sullivan said that amid the evolving threat landscape, and as there are more threats to judges, public officials must be responsible in their comments about the system of justice.",
      "\"The reality is that there are a lot of folks who will respond and react perhaps inappropriately based on something they heard or read, and so, I just think it's important for everyone to be responsible in what they say about our process,\" he said.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts separately spoke of the importance of preserving judicial independence in his year-end report closing out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "When it comes to protecting judges from threats, the federal judiciary's Vulnerability Management Program provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members last year, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report, released Tuesday.",
      "The program was established after Congress passed legislation responding to the 2020 killing of the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. The gunman found the judge's address, pictures of her house and vehicle information online.",

    "story": [
      "Police in Louisiana have arrested two more people who were allegedly involved in the off-campus, fraternity hazing death of 20-year-old Southern University student Caleb Wilson last month, bringing the total arrests to three.",
      "Baton Rouge Police Department on Tuesday announced the arrests of 25-year-old Kyle Thurman and 28-year-old Isaiah Smith. They were both charged with criminal hazing, a felony in the state of Louisiana, according to authorities. Law enforcement officials arrested Thurman on Monday in Port Allen, a neighboring city west of Baton Rouge. Smith turned himself into Baton Rouge police on Tuesday, the police department said.",
      "Police said more arrests were expected after Caleb McCray, 23, turned himself into police on Friday. McCray is accused of punching Wilson in the chest multiple times as part of a hazing ritual for the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, according to investigators. He was charged with criminal hazing and manslaughter.",
      "The deadly incident unfolded when Wilson and eight other fraternity pledges went to a warehouse of a flooring company in Baton Rouge on Feb. 26, police said. At the warehouse, they changed into gray sweatsuits for the hazing ritual that allegedly involved McCray, Thurman and Smith wearing boxing gloves and punching the pledges four times, according to their arrest warrants.",
      "\"Thurman proceeded to punch the first half of the group, McCray punched the second half, with Smith punching at least one pledge,\" Smith's arrest warrant said.",
      "Wilson, who was in the second group of pledges, collapsed to the floor, appeared to suffer a seizure and urinated on himself, according to the arrest warrants. No one called or attempted to call 911 or tried to summon an ambulance, Baton Rouge Police Department Chief Thomas Morse Jr. said at a news conference on Friday.",
      "Wilson was later dropped off by a group of males at Baton Rouge General Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, Morse said. The time between the incident at the warehouse and Wilson's arrival at the hospital was not immediately clear.",
      "Investigators later found that the vehicle that dropped Wilson off at the hospital was registered to Smith, according to his arrest warrant which also noted that Wilson was changed out of his clothing before he arrived at the hospital. Wilson was wearing only black sweatpants and white socks, the warrant said.",
      "Smith was confirmed to be the person in surveillance video seen removing Wilson from the car, according to the warrant. Investigators also later learned that he was the fraternity's Dean of Pledges and was in charge of the pledges at the time of the incident. McCray and Thurman were also identified as current members of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, their arrest warrants say.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A hurricane modeling specialist fired from the National Weather Service said progress on forecast accuracy may \"go backwards\" if job cuts continue.",
    "story": [
      "Andy Hazelton learned he'd been fired the same way everyone else did. Like hundreds of his colleagues at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, he received a mass email from the head of the agency at around 3:45 p.m. on Feb. 27 confirming his termination, effective immediately.",
      "\"They gave us 'til 5,\" said Hazelton, a scientist who specialized in hurricane research and modeling at the National Weather Service, the meteorological branch of NOAA responsible for weather forecasts. \"That was our cutoff. And then our email access was lost later that night, too.\"",
      "More than 800 employees were dismissed in February's initial sweep across NOAA, a congressional source told CBS News after the firings. And more job cuts could be coming \u2014 all as part of a federal cost-cutting initiative by the Trump administration and the Elon Musk-led\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "As the nation's primary hub for weather and climate information and a leading source of\u00a0environmental data overseas, NOAA is considered the authority on forecasting, storm tracking and climate monitoring. Many are warning that slashing its workforce could compromise the quality and accuracy of extreme weather forecasts that guide government responses to hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and floods, often providing life-saving predictions and warnings that don't exist anywhere else.",
      "The job cuts at NOAA \"jeopardize our ability to forecast and respond to extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods\u2014putting communities in harm's way,\" said Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees NOAA, in a statement responding to the agency's job cuts.",
      "The American Meteorological Society, an organization that partners with NOAA, warned in a separate statement that \"the consequences to the American people will be large and wide-ranging, including increased vulnerability to hazardous weather.\"",
      "Peak tornado season is now in full swing in the United States, where wildfire and hurricane seasons typically pick up in May and June but have started sooner and stretched on longer in recent years. Natural disasters are occurring with increasing frequency and strength\u00a0because of climate change.",
      "Hazelton's termination came about four months into his tenure as a full-time federal employee at the weather service's National Hurricane Center in Miami. On his first day, back in October, Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida's west coast, and during his time at the agency he worked on a storm prediction program that provided data to inform track forecasts, hazard warnings and evacuation orders for storms like it.",
      "\"It's hard to say for sure, but with fewer people working on upgrades to the models, and fewer people working on collecting the data that goes into these models, I think it's quite possible that the model accuracy will not have continued the improvement that we've seen over the last five, 10, 15 years for hurricanes,\" Hazelton said. \"We may start to lose those improvements or even potentially reverse some of the skill and go backwards if we're not careful. You know, especially if these cuts continue.\"",
      "A Trump administration official told CBS News the first round of job cuts at NOAA shrunk its staff by 5% and largely spared employees with critical roles, such as weather service meteorologists. But a source at the National Weather Service disputed that, saying some meteorologists including radar specialists were impacted, as were staff of the Hurricane Hunters crew, which fly airplanes into storms during hurricanes to help forecasters make accurate predications.",
      "At least a significant portion of the cuts impacted workers in the \"probation\" period of their employment, which usually lasts 1 to 3 years after starting a full-time role, according to a NOAA source. Probationary employees aren't necessarily novices, though. A weather service source said staff with 15 years of experience at NOAA, or more, could technically be categorized that way if they were recently promoted to a higher position.",
      "NOAA is now preparing to lose more than 1,000 additional workers in a second round of firings, sources told CBS News this week. The agency could ultimately lose about 20% of its staff along with some of the programs they work on, although it's not known which will be impacted.",
      "DOGE has also announced it might terminate the leases of 19 NOAA offices nationwide, including key buildings that generate vital weather forecasts and maintain radar operations. Individual offices have already paused some operations because of a lack of workers. The weather service office in Kotzebue, Alaska, said shortly after the first wave of layoffs that it would stop launching weather balloons, which collect weather observations from the atmosphere, indefinitely, while NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory shut down its communications services due to staff reductions there.",
      "Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, called the firings \"shortsighted.\" Without a means to replace lost employees or their work, Swain told CBS News he believes the situation could quickly devolve into a public safety threat.",
      "\"These literally are the people who are responsible for issuing a tornado warning during a tornado outbreak, or a flash flood warning during a flash flood, and we've seen plenty of deadly iterations of those kinds of things in recent years,\" he said of NOAA staffers. \"Same thing, by the way, when it comes to extreme wildfire conditions. The weather service office in L.A. was very active in the days leading up to and following the catastrophic fires just a couple of months ago.\"",
      "Swain said the reduction in NOAA's workforce will make nearly every aspect of his job as a weather and climate scientist more challenging, and the firings stand to influence a broader network of industries, too.",
      "\"It will affect every single colleague that I have, working in any type of weather or climate institution, whether it's public, private or academic,\" he said. \"It will really affect every single American, and, frankly, many people around the world, because NOAA is the backbone for providing virtually all of the basic weather information that is needed to produce global weather forecasts to observe and understand climate change, essentially, to predict the future, to lessen the impacts of disasters, you name it.\"",
      "Swain and almost 150 other scientists signed an open letter to Congress and the Trump administration before NOAA's layoffs last month, calling for a stop to what they deemed an \"increasing assault\" on science conducted at U.S. agencies and institutions as earlier federal cuts hit the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.",
      "\"Without a strong NOAA, a cornerstone of the U.S. scientific research enterprise, the world will be flying blind into the growing perils of global climate change,\" read the letter, which urged Congress and the Trump administration to keep NOAA fully staffed.",
      "Later, in a video shared to his YouTube channel the day of the NOAA firings, Swain said, \"There will be people who die in extreme weather events and related disasters who would not have otherwise.\"",
      "NOAA declined to comment on the layoffs. In a statement emailed to CBS News, a spokesperson for the agency said \"we are not discussing internal personnel and management matters.\"",
      "\"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience. We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Rick Spinrad, who was NOAA's administrator during the Biden administration, is worried about the impact on the National Weather Service, saying job cuts will \"most assuredly\" affect the availability, frequency and accuracy of weather warnings.",
      "\"I think at some point people are going to recognize we need these capabilities for the public good, which, after all, is the role of government,\" he said. \"The question is: how much damage will we sustain before we're able to turn around the damage that's already been done?\"",
      "Rob Marciano, \n                                                  \n                                  Jordan Freiman and \n                                                  \n                                  Tracy J. Wholf\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",

      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",

At least 30 of the militants had been killed, security officials said, while about 190 of the roughly 450 passengers initially on the train had been rescued.",
      "Militants wearing vests loaded with explosives surrounded the remaining 250 or so hostages after the attack on the train, which happened as it entered a tunnel Tuesday in Bolan, a district in the restive Balochistan province.",
      "The Baloch Liberation Army, a U.S. and Pakistani-designated terrorist organization that has waged a yearslong insurgency in Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Spokesman Jeeyand Baloch said the group was ready to free passengers if authorities agree to release jailed militants.",
      "Authorities said those rescued as of Wednesday included women and children, while an undisclosed number of security personnel had been killed, according to three security officials who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to media.",
      "According to the officials, the train was partially inside a tunnel when the militants blew up the tracks and immobilized the engine and its nine coaches. The driver was critically wounded by gunfire and guards aboard the train were attacked, although the officials gave no details on the number of guards who were aboard, or their fate.",
      "A security officer in province capital Quetta told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai the militants had split the hostages into small groups and that they were using them as human shields. The BLA warned that the life of hostages would be at risk if the government did not negotiate a release of prisoners.",

      "In Iran, the militant group Jaish al-Adl has carried out many attacks in recent years. Tehran has sought help from Pakistan in countering the threat from Jaish al-Adl, and Pakistan also wants Tehran to deny sanctuaries to BLA fighters. In January 2024, the two nations engaged in a tit-for-tat airstrike targeting insurgents inside each other's border areas, killing at least 11 people, but later they quickly deescalated the situation through talks",
      "Trains in Balochistan typically have security personnel on board as members of the military frequently use them to travel from Quetta to other parts of the country. Militants have attacked trains in the past but have never managed to hijack one.",
      "In November, the BLA carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta that killed 26 people.",
      "Pakistani authorities and analysts estimate that the BLA has around 3,000 fighters.",
      "Analysts have said the train attack, putting so many civilians in danger, could backfire for the BLA.",

      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday night at 11:57 p.m. EDT. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",

      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",

    "summary": "U.K. police say the Solong cargo ship's captain, identified by the vessel's owner as a Russian national, was detained on suspicion of negligent manslaughter.",
    "story": [
      "British police on Tuesday arrested the captain of a cargo ship on suspicion of manslaughter as they searched for answers about why it\u00a0hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military\u00a0off eastern England a day earlier, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor was presumed dead in the collision.",
      "Humberside Police said the 59-year-old was detained \"on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.\" He wasn't named by the police and has not been charged.",
      "Shipping company Ernst Russ, the owner of the Portugal-flagged container carrier the Solong, said the arrested man was the ship's master, whom the firm identified on Wednesday as a Russian national. It said he \"and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations.\"",
      "The company said the ship's 14 crew members were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.",
      "U.K. authorities have said they don't suspect foul play in the collision.",
      "An American crew member of the U.S.-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker who anonymously spoke to CBS News because he wasn't permitted to speak with media about the crash said the vessel had been anchored on the spot where the collision occurred. The tanker had relayed its coordinates, the man said, meaning all other vessels in the area should have known its position.",
      "The crew member said the Solong\u00a0\"came out of the blue\"\u00a0and struck the Stena.",
      "He said he was near to the part of the Stena where the Solong made its impact, and that he had only seconds to react when he heard shouts to brace before impact.",
      "The government said the cause of the collision was being investigated. There was no indication of foul play, but it sparked fears of significant environmental damage.",
      "U.K. officials were watching for damage to birds and sea life after jet fuel poured into the North Sea when the Solong broadsided the Stena Monday. The collision sparked explosions and fires that burned for more than 24 hours.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News Monday that the Stena was carrying cargo in support of the Defense Department. The collision did not impact operations or combat readiness, the official said.",
      "Footage filmed from a helicopter on Tuesday morning showed the fire appeared to largely be out on the Stena, which had a large gash on its port side.",
      "The U.K. coast guard agency said Tuesday that the Solong was still alight. It said the cargo ship, whose front end was crushed and blackened, was drifting south, away from the tanker, and an approximately half-mile exclusion zone had been put in place around both ships.",
      "\"No sign of pollution from vessels is observed at this time,\" British Transport Minister Mike Kane told lawmakers in the House of Commons.",
      "The government said air quality readings were normal and the risk to public health onshore was \"very low.\"",
      "Kane initially said the Solong was expected to sink, but the government said later that both vessels were likely to stay afloat.",
      "The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea.",
      "All but one of the 37 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore in the port of Grimsby, about 150 miles (north of London, with no major injuries. One crew member was missing, and the coast guards called off the search late Monday.",
      "\"Our working assumption is that, very sadly, the sailor is deceased,\" Kane said.",
      "The U.K. Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun gathering evidence of what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth, Scotland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored about 10 miles off the English coast.",
      "The investigation will be led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.",
      "The 596-foot Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. Its operator, U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, said that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel in 16 tanks, at least one of which was ruptured.",
      "The company said it was unclear how much fuel had leaked into the sea.",
      "The North Sea is home to a number of protected marine animals, as well as vital fishing stocks for the U.K. and other European countries.",
      "Oceana U.K. believes the collision took place near two protected areas in particular, including the Southern North Sea marine protected area, which is designated to protect the harbor porpoise, according to Naomi Tilley, the Oil and Gas Campaign Lead at Oceana U.K., an environmental group focused on oceans.",
      "\"It's a really important area of breeding and a really large portion of the global population is found in that area,\" she told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The owner of the Solong said that contrary to earlier reports, the vessel wasn't carrying containers of sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water. It said that four empty containers had previously contained the chemical.",
      "\"Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with cleanup teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Greenpeace U.K. said it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage from the collision, which took place near busy fishing grounds and major seabird colonies.",
      "Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.",

      "They run businesses. They tend bars. They pay taxes. While they are in the U.S. illegally, they are largely spared the scrutiny of that label. But still they live in fear. They are the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants in America today.",
      "Recent estimates from the Irish government suggest that there are as many as 10,000 undocumented Irish immigrants across the United States. Many have lived in the shadows for decades, waiting for a pathway to citizenship that may never come. And with a new president that has vowed to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, anxieties have been heightened.",
      "\"It's definitely a concern, definitely a worry,\" Mary, an undocumented Irish immigrant in New England, told CBS News. \"I've heard of different people, you know, getting caught up in a swoop of undocumented people \u2014 some of them may be criminals, but some of them may not be, and it's just a situation of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"",
      "Mary, and others interviewed for this story, asked that their full names not be used to maintain their anonymity.",
      "Irish privilege?",
      "While Mary fears for her own status, she says communities of color are bearing the brunt of President Trump's immigration crackdown while she can somewhat fly under the radar.",
      "\"There's some very hardworking people that have set up businesses and are employing people and all of a sudden, you know, they're on a plane somewhere, their lives have changed, and it's very hard,\" she said. \"I absolutely do feel for people.\"",
      "Aisling, an undocumented Irish waitress in Chicago, who has lived in America for eight years, says that while she is concerned she may become a \"collateral damage\" target for the administration, ICE raids in her neighborhood have targeted predominantly Latino communities \u2014 something she has condemned as racist.",
      "\"If ICE were to walk into my work, I could definitely just blend in with the crowd, but the fear for me is getting pulled over or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" she told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment as to how ICE conducts its enforcement operations and whether the characterization that they are specifically targeting Hispanic and Latino communities is a fair one.",
      "Mick, who arrived in New York from Ireland in 2000, said public treatment of Irish people in the U.S. was in many ways the opposite of what other nationalities face. \"I used to find it quite unfair hearing how locals would speak about these immigrants coming here,\" he explained. \"I'd have to remind them, say, 'Hey guys, I'm an immigrant.'\" The attitude, he said, was, \"'Yeah, but you're different.'\"",
      "Mick was undocumented for the first few years he lived in the U.S., but he is now a citizen and describes himself as a proud New Yorker. He said there was a \"much broader fear\" among immigrant communities now during the second Trump administration.",
      "\"There's tips being posted online \u2026 for people to report businesses if they suspect there's undocumented people working. It's horrible. There's definitely a feeling here, which is new and not nice,\" he said.",
      "Ciara, who arrived in the U.S. before President Trump took office, said she was on a J-1 visa, which allows for educational and cultural exchange, but working illegally on the side. \"There is a bit of a safety net\" for Irish people in the hospitality industry, she said.",
      "\"It definitely is a worry, but I think I am definitely very privileged as well. I'm a White Irish girl with a third-level [college] education, so I think I'm in a lot more secure position to a lot of other people who are undocumented.\"",
      "But immigration attorneys have told CBS News that it would be naive for Irish undocumented people to believe that they may be immune to deportation.",
      "\"When Irish people come here, they come on what we call the visa waiver program, so that allows them to come to the United States without going to the consulate in Dublin, and they can come in for 90 days and stay for 90 days, and so most of them [who are undocumented] overstay,\" John Foley, a Boston-based immigration attorney told CBS News.",
      "\"The waiver part means they waive all rights to judicial processing, meaning they can be removed or deported from the United States without going in front of a judge,\" Foley said. \"If you're an ICE officer and you need to get 40 people a week, it's Thursday and you're at 27, you don't care where the last 13 come from.\"",
      "Contribution to the American economy",
      "Tom, a New York bar owner and legal resident in Manhattan, told CBS News that he has employed many undocumented Irish workers as well as undocumented Central and South American staff in his pub over the years. He says he couldn't operate as a business owner without them.",
      "\"I'd say 90% of the restaurants and small businesses in this city would close down if you took away the [undocumented] immigrants,\" Tom said. \"The folks who want to do those jobs are people that don't have clear legal paths into America.\"",
      "An estimate from the American Immigration Council showed that undocumented immigrants in America contributed $75.6 billion in taxes in 2022. That included $29 billion in state and local taxes and $46.6 billion in federal taxes.",
      "Aisling, in Chicago, says her colleagues at the bar where she works are predominantly undocumented.",

      "Legal pathways for undocumented immigrants are limited",
      "Mary, in New England, arrived in the U.S. in 1999. In the 26 years that she has lived in America, she has become a property owner and is self-employed.\u00a0 For the past 14 years, she has been trying to obtain sponsorship for legal residency through a legal petition from her brother, who is an American citizen. That process is still pending with no end in sight.",
      "\"There isn't really any opportunities,\" she said. \"There isn't a path right now for me.\"",
      "It's an issue facing many undocumented immigrants working in the United States today, where few legal pathways exist, and where they do, massive backlogs and bureaucracy cause long processing delays.",
      "A 2023 policy analysis\u00a0from the conservative think tank the Cato Institute said that fewer than 1% of people who want to move permanently to the United States can do so legally.",
      "One young Irish woman who overstayed her visa waiver in New York and is now working in a bar in Manhattan told CBS News that she just wants to work, but the avenues are limited.",
      "\"I would prefer to be legal and have legal status, but it was hard in general to get a visa, and I feel like now, it's 10 times harder to even consider trying to get a visa,\" she said.",
      "Mick, who eventually obtained citizenship, said he would support amnesty for people without criminal convictions who are living illegally in the U.S. and contribute to communities.",
      "\"A lot of the people who are coming to our countries and our shores are coming here because of policies that we've allowed to happen and that have benefited us for decades,\" he said. \"I feel like we should be looking after people who need help the most. And I've never met any evil, nasty people who eat dogs and cats who came here legally or illegally.\"",

      "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia \u2014 The U.S. and Ukraine said Kyiv would accept a 30-day ceasefire with Russia after talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, with Washington pledging to immediately lift a freeze on intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,\"\u00a0 the U.S. and Ukraine said in a joint statement released by the State Department. \"The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "The agreement came after more than eight hours of\u00a0negotiations\u00a0between Ukrainian officials and a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Saudi city of Jeddah.",
      "The statement said the U.S. \"will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\" Both were frozen\u00a0in the wake of an explosive meeting between Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Trump at the White House on Feb. 28.",
      "The now-unfrozen military aid includes roughly $1 billion in equipment that was approved by the Biden administration and has not yet been delivered. The Trump administration has the authority to provide another $3.8 billion in aid but has not announced any further aid packages. Ukraine has been buoyed by the U.S. and other Western allies in its fight against Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, and the move to cut off aid left Kyiv at a disadvantage and European allies scrambling.",

      "The U.K. Coastguard said an exclusion zone of about half of a mile had been established around both vessels, which were no longer stuck together.",
      "\"At this stage, it's too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage,\" Greenpeace U.K. said in a statement early Tuesday, explaining that the severity of any impact would depend on a number of factors, including \"the amount and type of oil carried by the tanker, the fuel carried by both ships, and how much of that, if any, has entered the water.\"",
      "The U.K. Coastguard said its Counter Pollution and Salvage Team was \"assessing the situation\" and \"developing a plan ready for implementation as soon as the situation allows.\"",
      "Air quality in the area was reported to be normal, and there was a \"very low\" public health risk on nearby shores, according to the U.K. Health Security Agency.",
      "\"It's really hard to know at this stage what is in the water and how that's going to behave, but almost in any circumstances, it's bad news,\" Tilley told CBS News.",

      "The North Sea is home to a number of protected marine animals, as well as vital fishing stocks for the U.K. and other European countries.",
      "Oceana U.K. believes the collision took place near two protected areas in particular, including the Southern North Sea marine protected area, which is designated to protect the harbor porpoise, Tilley said.",
      "\"It's a really important area of breeding and a really large portion of the global population is found in that area,\" she said.",
      "The harbor porpoise is a \"species that needs to come to the surface to breathe, so it won't easily be able to avoid slicks on the surface,\" Tilley told CBS News.",

      "Both of the vessels involved in the collision would have had their own fuel for propulsion, and the American tanker that was hit, the MV Stena Immaculate, was also transporting jet fuel, according to Crowley, the U.S. logistics group that operates the vessel.",
      "Jet fuel is toxic for marine life, and Crowley said some of it had been released in the crash.",
      "\"The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the collision,\" Crowley said in a statement to the Reuters news agency. \"A fire occurred as a result.\"",

Sodium cyanide is a toxic substance that evaporates quickly and could have created dangerous air conditions on the surface of the water for cleanup crews and animals.",

    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Manila's international airport Tuesday on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.",
      "Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement.",
      "\"Upon his arrival, the prosecutor general served the ICC notification for an arrest warrant to the former president for the crime of crime against humanity,\" the government said. \"He's now in the custody of authorities.\"",
      "The surprise arrest sparked a commotion at the airport when lawyers and Duterte aides loudly protested that they, along with a doctor and lawyers, were prevented from coming close to him after he was taken into police custody. \"This is a violation of his constitutional right,\" Sen. Bong Go, a close Duterte ally, told reporters.",
      "Duterte's former lawyer and spokesperson, Salvador Panelo, asserted in a statement that the warrant came from \"a spurious source,\" since the ICC has no jurisdiction in the Philippines, the Reuters news agency reported. The ICC says it has jurisdiction there over alleged crimes committed before the country withdrew as a member.",
      "The arrest warrant sent by the ICC to Philippine officials, a copy of which was seen by The AP, said, \"There are reasonable grounds to believe\" the attack on victims \"was both widespread and systematic: The attack took place over a period of several years and thousands people appear to have been killed.\"",
      "Duterte's arrest was necessary \"to ensure his appearance before the court,\" according to the March 7 warrant, adding that the former president was expected to ignore a court summons.",
      "It said that although Duterte was no longer president, he \"appears to continue to wield considerable power.\"",
      "\"Mindful of the resultant risk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims, the chamber is satisfied that the arrest of Mr. Duterte is necessary,\" it said.",
      "A photo released by his political party said he was being held at the Villamor Air Base next to Manila airport, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "The government said Duterte was in good health.",
      "Relatives of victims of Duterte drug killings react",
      "Duterte's arrest and downfall stunned families of the victims of his bloody crackdowns against illegal drugs and drove them to tears.",
      "\"This is a big, long-awaited day for justice,\" Randy delos Santos, the uncle of a teenager killed by police during an anti-drug operation in August 2017 in the Manila metropolis, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Now we feel that justice is rolling. We hope that top police officials and the hundreds of police officers who were involved in the illegal killings should also be placed in custody and punished,\" delos Santos said.",
      "Three of the police officers who killed his nephew, Kian delos Santos, were convicted in 2018 for the high-profile murder, which prompted Duterte at the time to temporarily suspend his brutal anti-drugs crackdown.",
      "The conviction was one of at least three, so far, against law enforcement personnel involved in the anti-drugs campaign, reflecting the concerns of families of victims of suspected extrajudicial killings that they wouldn't get justice in the Philippines, which led to their decision to seek the help of the ICC.",
      "Long history of drug killings under Duterte",
      "The ICC investigated drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. In 2019, Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by noting that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn't have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration's objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asked international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a criminal suspect.",

      "The annual report looks at data from more than more than 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, territories and regions, according to IQAir, an air technology company based in Switzerland.",
      "The rankings are based on the annual average of concentrated micrograms of an air pollutant per cubic meter of air. The World Health Organization recommends 5 micrograms of pollutant per cubic meter.",
      "Which countries have the lowest air quality?",
      "Worldwide, the countries with the worst air quality were Chad, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and India. Chad had 91.5 micrograms of pollutant per cubic meter, IQAir said \u2014 more than 18 times more than what the WHO recommends. Bangladesh had 78, Pakistan had 73.7, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had 58.2, and India had 50.6 micrograms per cubic meter.",
      "But Byrnihat, India was the most polluted metropolitan area in 2024, the IQAir report said. The city had an annual average concentration of 128.2 micrograms per cubic meter of air. India was home to six of the nine most polluted global cities, IQAir said.",
      "One hundred and twenty-six countries, or 91.3% of the world, exceeded the WHO guideline, according to the report.",
      "Conditions on the ground in various countries can affect the amount of pollutants per cubic meter, IQAir said. Wildfires in the Amazon caused levels in parts of Brazil to nearly quadruple in the fall. The entire continent of Africa only has one moniotring station for every 3.7 million people, IQAir said, which may lead to inaccurate data for the region.",
      "What parts of the U.S. have the best and worst air quality?",
      "Most cities in the United States had between 5.1 and 15 micrograms of pollution per cubic meter of air, according to IQAir. A number of cities, especially along the West Coast, New England and in the Southwest, had between 0 and 5 micrograms of pollution per cubic meter, meeting WHO guidelines.",
      "The major city with the worst air pollution was Los Angeles, California. The smaller municipality of Ontario, California, had the most pollution of any city, the report said.",
      "Seattle, Washington was the cleanest major city in the U.S., according to IQAir.",
      "What parts of the world have the best air quality?",
      "Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand met the WHO guideline for air quality. The cleanest metropolitan area in the world was Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, with an annual average concentration of 1.1 micrograms per cubic meter of air.",
      "The cleanest region is Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and hundreds of smaller islands. Fifty-seven percent of cities in the region met the WHO guideline, the IQAir report found.",
      "Seventeen percent of cities included in the report met the annual WHO guideline, IQAir said. That's an increase from 2023, when just 9% of cities met the guideline.",
      "\"While this marks some progress, much more work has yet to be done to protect human health, especially that of children,\" IQAir said in the report.",
      "Why is air quality so important?",
      "Air pollution is a \"critical threat to both human health and environmental stability, IQAir CEO Frank Hammes said in a news release announcing the findings of the report.",
      "Ninety-nine percent of the world's population lives in areas that do not meet recommended air quality guideline levels, according to WHO. Air pollution is the second leading global risk factor for death. In 2021, 8.1 million deaths worldwide could be attributed to air pollution, IQAir said.",
      "Exposure to concentrated micrograms of an air pollutant caused about 58% of those deaths, IQAir said. Exposure to micrograms of pollutants can contribute to and exacerbate health conditions including asthma, cancer, stroke and lung diseases. Children may face issues with respiratory and developmental health.",

    "summary": "Here are the products subject to China's retaliatory tariffs, and how U.S. farmers are reacting to Trump's trade policy.",
    "story": [
      "China's retaliatory tariffs went into effect Monday, spelling trouble for American farmers by making U.S.-grown crops more expensive for their top purchaser.",
      "Beijing imposed the levies in response to President Trump's extra 10% blanket tariff on Chinese goods. Under China's retaliatory action, U.S. farmers now face levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "China is the largest market for such products, and if prices of foreign-grown goods rise in China, locals will turn to less expensive alternatives either from China or other countries. American farmers that deal in chicken and more will likely lose market share as a result.",
      "\"If prices go up, folks won't eat imported stuff,\" a fruit seller, surnamed Shi, told Agence France-Presse. \"There will be more domestic goods sold, and I think this is something folks can accept.\"",
      "Shi told the agency that if U.S. produce prices rise, he might seek out replacement fruit and vegetables from Thailand and Malaysia.",
      "Goods that shipped before Monday and arrive in China before April 12 will not be subject to the new tariffs.",
      "\"A web of uncertainty\"",
      "Virginia-based farmer John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers Association, told CBS MoneyWatch that Mr. Trump's trade conflict with China hits farmers like himself hard.",
      "For one, Mr. Trump's earlier flip-flopping on his tariff policy vis-a-vis Mexico and Canada \"has cast a web of uncertainty around agriculture,\" Boyd told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are really shaking at the root of all the major commodities that we produce in the U.S., because we are a market-driven industry.\"",
      "Farmers are bearing the brunt of the effects of a trade war with key U.S. trade partners, Boyd added. \"The president is using American farmers to bargain with, but at the end of the day, we are the ones that are hurting.\"",
      "Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, told CBS MoneyWatch that the industry had anticipated that Mr. Trump would impose levies on key U.S. trade partners, but that there wasn't a whole lot the farmers he represents could do to prepare.",
      "\"Of course, agriculture products are subject to the retaliatory tariffs, and farmers tend to be the ones that get it first and hardest in a trade war; we take the brunt of this and get a black eye or busted nose,\" Levendofsky told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He explained that farmers across the U.S. are grappling with high input costs, including the price of seeds, fertilizer, chemicals, fuel and equipment costs needed to run their farms. Meanwhile, commodity prices are low.",
      "\"This trade war and these tariffs adds to that very stressful time and does not help the farm economy. When farmers aren't making money, they are not spending money and that directly ripples across the rural economy,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 16:05:28 -0400",
    "summary": "In a sign of his improved health, Pope Francis followed the Vatican's weeklong spiritual retreat via videoconference on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Doctors said Monday Pope Francis is no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of pneumonia that has kept him hospitalized for nearly a month, but have decided to keep him hospitalized for several more days to receive treatment.",
      "In a late update, the doctors said the 88-year-old pope remains stable and has consolidated improvements in recent days, as determined by blood tests and positive responses to drug treatments.",
      "The\u00a0Vatican said the doctors had lifted their previous \"guarded\" prognosis, meaning they determined he was no longer in imminent danger as a result of the original respiratory infection he arrived with on Feb. 14. But their caution remained.",
      "\"However, in view of the complexity of the clinical picture and the important infectious picture presented on admission, it will be necessary to continue medical drug therapy in a hospital setting for additional days,\" according to the Vatican statement.",
      "In a sign of his improved health, Francis followed the Vatican's weeklong spiritual retreat via videoconference on Monday in both the morning and afternoon sessions.",
      "As he did on Sunday, Francis participated in the retreat remotely from the Rome hospital where he is being treated. He could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals gathered for the retreat in the Vatican auditorium could not see or hear him.",
      "Pasolini is delivering a series of meditations this week on \"The hope of eternal life,\" a theme that was chosen well before\u00a0Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection.",
      "The retreat, an annual gathering that kicks off the\u00a0Catholic Church's solemn Lenten season\u00a0leading to Easter, continues through the week. The Vatican has said Francis would participate \"in spiritual communion\" with the rest of the hierarchy, from afar.",
      "Francis also resumed his physical and respiratory therapy at the Gemelli hospital, and rested and prayed in between. Francis has been using a nasal tube for supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night, therapy that he was continuing Monday.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was just a bad case of bronchitis when he was hospitalized last month. The infection progressed into a\u00a0complex respiratory tract infection\u00a0and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",
      "Francis was still keeping his eye on things. The Vatican said he had been informed about the floods in his native Argentina and expressed his closeness to the affected population. In addition, a Vatican cardinal close to Francis spoke out Monday to refute some negative media reports that have circulated in his absence.",
      "The Vatican development office released a letter written by Cardinal Michael Czerny to one of Francis' close friends, the Argentine social justice activist Juan Grabois. Grabois had travelled to Rome to pray for Francis at Gemelli hospital, and some Italian media reported last month that he had tried to forcibly get into Francis' 10th floor hospital suite, a claim he denied.",
      "In the March 6 letter, Czerny told Grabois that Francis \"knew of your presence in Rome and your daily vigils of prayer and spiritual solidarity at Gemelli Polyclinic and I'm sure this gave him a true comfort and support.\"",
      "\"Additionally, I know that you join me in strongly repudiating the unfounded versions that have circulated in some media about alleged inappropriate behavior in the hospital,\" Czerny wrote.",
      "The Vatican is always abuzz with rumor but has gone into overdrive with speculation about Francis' health and talk of conclaves, even though Francis is very much alive and in charge. The fact that Czerny felt it necessary to defend one of Francis' friends suggested that the rumor and maneuvering in Francis' absence had crossed a line.",
      "On Thursday, the Vatican will mark the 12th anniversary of Francis' election, the first with the pope out of sight but still in charge. Francis was elected the 266th pope,\u00a0the first Jesuit pope\u00a0and first from Latin America on March 13, 2013, following the resignation of\u00a0Pope Benedict XVI.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-south-africa-farmers-white-afrikaners-offer-us-citizenship/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 13:30:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump says he'll offer White South African farmers \"safe refuge\" as U.S. citizens, but do they actually want it?",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0President Trump doubled down Friday on his offer to grant U.S. citizenship to White Afrikaner farmers in South Africa, accusing their government of treating them \"terribly.\" Mr. Trump said the U.S. would offer them \"safety\" and that they would be given a \"rapid pathway to citizenship.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously pointed to new land expropriation laws in South Africa that he claims are racist and a breach of the White farmers' human rights. In reaction to the laws, he has halted all foreign aid to South Africa.",
      "Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been cool for several years, since then-U.S. Ambassador Reuben Brigety, during a May 2023 news conference, accused South Africa of loading weapons onto a U.S.-sanctioned Russian ship in Simon's Town harbor which then sailed back to Russia, where the weapons were allegedly used to help in the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump's offer of \"safe refuge\" for Afrikaner farmers",
      "That tension has been exacerbated by South Africa's case at the International Criminal Court, where it has accused close U.S. ally Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in the war-torn Gaza Strip.",
      "In a Friday post on his own Truth social platform, Mr. Trump once again offered \"safe refuge\" to Afrikaner farmers who feel unsafe in South Africa. That came after, on Feb. 7, Mr. Trump signed an executive order accusing the South African government of adopting racist laws that discriminate against Afrikaners, an ethnic group made up primarily of the descendants of Dutch settlers who started arriving in the country hundreds of years ago and now amount to about 13% of the population.",
      "He specifically called out a law that was passed to allow the government expropriation of some privately owned land without compensation.",
      "South Africa's government hit back at the time, saying the law pertained to unused land or land that was not serving the public interest. Mr. Trump ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to prioritize the resettlement program in the U.S. for Afrikaners who feel they have been the victims of racial discrimination. He also cut off all aid and assistance to South Africa for as long as the land expropriation law remains on the books.",
      "What do Afrikaner farmers actually want?",
      "Talk shows and editorials in South Africa buzzed with talk of Mr. Trump's executive order, and the possibility of even more U.S. sanctions. Many South Africans who've called into such shows have voiced confusion, as it seems there's little interest in an offer of asylum in the U.S. \u2014 even among the leaders of the Afrikaans groups who have appealed to Mr. Trump for help.",
      "\"I think we the Afrikaners have been treated as a scapegoat and punching bag in this country for three decades, with political leaders chanting on stage at political rallies 'kill the boer,' so we are very grateful for someone like President Trump to acknowledge the 144 race laws in South Africa,\" Ernest Roets, former head of policy at the Afrikaans organization Solidarity Movement, told CBS News.",
      "He added, however, that he and many other Afrikaner leaders do not want to leave the country, and do not necessarily support the blanket sanctions being imposed by the Trump administration. He said there should be targeted sanctions against \"specific leaders\" who act against the South Africa's constitution \"by discriminating against the Afrikaner with racist laws.\"",
      "South Africa's News24 reported over the weekend that members of the Solidarity group had travelled to the U.S. over the past two weeks and met with Michael Needham, a chief adviser to Rubio, as well as senior advisers to both President Trump and Vice President JD Vance and members of the U.S. Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "Flip Buys, who chairs the Solidarity Movement and who was among those to visit Washington, told News 24 that the possibility of targeted U.S. sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, which would require a determination of serious human rights violations, was discussed at the meetings.",
      "It's expected that a small number of farmers would take Mr. Trump up on his offer, but most say that while their rights and safety need to be protected, they want to stay on the land their families have farmed for, in many cases, generations.",
      "South Africa rejects Elon Musk's complaint over Starlink",
      "Mr. Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa and still holds dual nationality, took to his X platform Friday and criticized the government in Pretoria, claiming his Starlink satellite network was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa, because I'm not black.\"",
      "South Africa's Electronic Communications Act, which, since 2005 has regulated broadcasting and telecommunications in the post-Apartheid country, requires that at least 30% of a company must be owned by previously disadvantaged groups as part of the criteria to gain a communications license. News24 reports that, as of Friday, Starlink had not applied for a license to operate in the country.",
      "Clayson Monyela, the head of public diplomacy for the South African government's Department of International Relations and Cooperation, replied to Musk on X, saying: \"Sir that's NOT true, and you know it! It's got nothing to do with skin color.\"",
      "\"Starlink is welcome to operate in South Africa,\" Monyela said, \"provided there's compliance with local laws.\"",
      "Some South African government officials have told CBS News they expect they could be targeted with specific U.S. sanctions.",
      "There is also some concern that Mr. Trump will scrap the Africa Growth Opportunity Act, a trade agreement between the U.S. and 32 African countries that took effect in 2000.",
      "Multiple officials said there are already plans to draft a replacement trade and energy pact, with the hope that the White House can be convinced to consider a new deal.",

      "\"This new study further demonstrates how aspirin and other inhibitors of this pathway could be used in new treatments to prevent the cancer from metastasizing or spreading.\"",
      "Potential risks",
      "Roychoudhuri, the senior researcher, encouraged caution in applying the findings.",
      "While aspirin is low-cost and widely available, its long-term use is not without \"significant risks,\" he said, including stomach bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in older individuals.",

      "\"The risk-benefit calculation varies substantially between individuals based on age, comorbidities and concurrent medications,\" the doctor noted.",

      "Next steps",
      "The scientists are planning to conduct more research \u2014 through the Add-Aspirin clinical trial, which will recruit more than 10,000 patients with early-stage breast, colorectal, gastroesophageal and prostate cancers across the U.K. and India \u2014 to determine whether aspirin can stop or delay the recurrence of these cancers.",
      "\"Patients interested in aspirin therapy should discuss it with their oncologist or family practitioner, who can evaluate the potential benefits against the risks.\"",
      "\"Our research suggests aspirin could potentially be most beneficial for patients with early-stage cancers who have been treated with curative intent but might harbor undetected micrometastases,\" Roychoudhuri said.",

      "One patient\u2019s story",
      "One of\u00a0Scheinin\u2019s\u00a0patients was a pastor in his mid-50s who was infected with COVID-19 in March 2020.",
      "Pastor\u00a0Benjamin Thomas of East Meadow, Long Island, spent nearly 100 days in the hospital \u2014 54 of which were on a ventilator \u2014 and six weeks in a medically induced coma.",
      "5 YEARS AFTER COVID, AMERICANS ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER IT'S STILL A THREAT",
      "He was discharged in July 2020 with an oxygen tank. Despite overcoming the initial infection, Thomas\u2019 condition deteriorated.",
      "In 2022, the pastor noticed that his daily activity tolerance diminished dramatically and he required more oxygen for simple tasks.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"I couldn't take a shower for more than 30 seconds without being on oxygen,\" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.",
      "Scheinin said the pastor had no underlying conditions before contracting COVID. A lung biopsy showed that Thomas\u2019 symptoms were consistent with post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to the COVID-19 infection.",
      "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS \u2014 SOME MAY SURPRISE YOU",
      "Thomas\u2019 story was remarkable in that he survived the first bout with COVID, but two years later, his lungs had deteriorated so badly from the scarring that he needed a double lung transplant, Scheinin shared.",
      "After spending seven months on the wait list, Thomas opted to settle for one lung since that would be faster than waiting for two. His surgery was performed on Feb. 28, 2023.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung.\"",

      "What is post-COVID fibrosis?",
      "A healthy lung allows for the normal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, when one breathes air,\u00a0Scheinin told Fox News Digital.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.",
      "Testing for this condition is relatively non-invasive, typically including a cat scan or X-ray to check for structural lung damage, as well as blood tests and a pulmonary function test. (iStock)",
      "In certain cases, the doctor said, the lungs no longer function as well as they did before the infection.",
      "\"The normal gas exchange is impeded because now you have areas of the lung tissue that are scarred, and therefore they're not functioning normally,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"If it's a small area, it may be insignificant and unnoticeable, but as more of the lung tissue becomes scarred, more of the normal lung function is destroyed, [and] the patient becomes short of breath.\"",
      "This could lead to future issues, especially if the patient is exposed to other respiratory ailments.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung,\" Scheinin said. \"I think it just makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.\"",
      "Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment",
      "Symptoms of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis can mimic other types of interstitial lung diseases, which are disorders that\u00a0cause progressive scarring and inflammation of lung tissue.",
      "If a person who previously had a COVID infection continues to experience shortness of breath, chronic cough and change in their exercise tolerance \u2014 or if they smoke or have an underlying condition such as emphysema \u2014 they should see their physician or a pulmonologist, according to Scheinin.",

      "Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how House Republicans' narrowly-passed budget bill will help advance Trump's agenda and how she is responding to Democrats' 'fearmongering' over the possibility of Medicaid cuts.",
      "Democratic New York Rep. Tom Suozzi said Tuesday that there is a catastrophe brewing for the country's aging population, and he wants to do something about it.",
      "Alongside Republican Rep. John Moolenaar, Suozzi introduced the \"Well-Being Insurance for Seniors to be at Home Act\" on Tuesday, which seeks to help more of the country's increasingly older population obtain long-term home care insurance.",
      "\"Currently, 10,000 Americans every day are turning 65-years-old,\" Suozzi told reporters during a press call on Tuesday, and, in five years, 6,000 Americans will turn 85 every day. Suozzi also noted that right now, only about 4% of seniors are covered by long-term care insurance.",
      "AGING MAY SPEED UP IN AREAS WITH EXTREME HEAT, RESEARCH SUGGESTS",
      "\"One of the main causes of people becoming homeless \u2014 new homeless people \u2014 is turning 80 years old, because a lot of people are becoming destitute as they get old, and they face what are called, \u2018Their inability to conduct daily activities of living,'\" Suozzi said. \"And right now, very few people have long-term care insurance, and people will end up going into nursing homes. And not only can the nursing homes not handle this volume of people, but the Medicaid system will go bust, and two thirds of the people in America that are in nursing homes are paid for with Medicaid.\"",
      "(Democratic New York Rep. Tom Suozzi said Tuesday that there is a catastrophe brewing for the country's aging population, and he wants to do something about it.)",
      "In addition to the increasingly growing senior population in the U.S., Suozzi also cited societal factors that are making it harder for aging and disabled seniors to receive the at-home care they need. One is the fact that Americans are having fewer kids, so there will be fewer of them to take care of their aging or disabled parents. Another was the fact that kids are increasingly moving to other parts of the country away from their parents, again increasing the burden for seniors to figure things out on their own.",
      "\"There's a lot of people becoming senior citizens right now because the baby boomers, there's less kids available to take care of them, and the kids that are alive don't necessarily live where their parents live. So we've got this big perfect storm brewing, and Medicaid will never be able to solve this problem,\" according to Suozzi. \"And nursing homes \u2014 there's just not enough nursing homes. There's not enough money to pay for the nursing homes for all these people. So my legislation is designed to try and encourage the private sector to create long-term care insurance that is affordable.\"",

      "In five years, 6,000 Americans will turn 85 every day. (iStock)",
      "Known by its acronym, WISH, Suozzi and Moolenaar's new bill seeks to create a federal \"Catastrophic Care Fund\" that will help cover some of the cost-burden of long-term care. The goal is to encourage private insurers to develop and market affordable and accessible long-term care insurance, which, overtime, they have ceased providing more broadly. The reason, Suozzi said, is it was just not profitable enough for them, as most seniors with long-term care insurance were outliving their expected life terms and costing insurance companies a lot of money as a result.",
      "Suozzi likened his new plan to Medicare Part B, another similar cost-sharing program that has pushed insurers to incentivize customers to enroll. Seniors would be able to benefit from the newly created fund on a tiered basis, according to each person's income level.",
      "MEASLES MORE LIKELY TO BE SEVERE AMONG MALNOURISHED, RFK SAYS",
      "The Democrat lawmaker pointed out how the WISH Act will help reduce the cost burden of federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which can help pay for the fund. He also suggested a payment plan involving an increased income tax shared by both employees and employers, but Suozzi noted that plan was unlikely to get the GOP support necessary. Another potential payment option for the new long-term care fund could stem from reforms to Social Security, the congressman added.",
      "Suozzi introduced the \"Well-Being Insurance for Seniors to be at Home Act\" on Tuesday, which seeks to help more of the country's increasingly older population obtain long-term home care insurance. (Mary Altaffer/AP Photo)",
      "Besides the \"perfect storm\" that is brewing for seniors, a second storm is also brewing on Capitol Hill right now in regard to how to fund the federal government. Republicans are ramping up reconciliation efforts and, as part of that framework, they are looking for roughly $800 billion in Medicaid cuts. While the Wish Act could help lower the amount of necessary cuts during reconciliation, Suozzi said he feared it was too tight of a window to get enough lawmakers on board.",
      "\"I guess there's an argument that it could go in there, if we could demonstrate between now and then that it'll be a big savings in Medicaid,\" Suozzi told reporters. \"I see this is taking the full term of getting people educated about the issue, getting more people interested in the issue, and getting senior advocacy groups and private insurers to advocate on behalf of this idea. So it's not going to happen on its own. It will have to be part of something bigger, but not, I think, until we've educated people about the seriousness of the issue.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "SpyLoan apps are everywhere and\u00a0yet people keep falling for them. They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"",

      "SpyLend is a serious threat because it steals a huge amount of personal information. It digs into contact lists and call histories, reads text messages, including banking alerts, and grabs photos and videos from storage.",
      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",
      "This stolen data is not just used for blackmail, as it is often sold to cybercriminals. By preying on people already struggling financially, SpyLend puts nearly every part of their digital lives at risk.",

      "2) Install strong antivirus software: Use strong antivirus protection on all your devices to detect and prevent malicious apps. This can also protect against phishing emails and ransomware scams. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious apps is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",
      "If you\u2019ve shared sensitive information, consider changing passwords and securing your accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "The promise of quick and easy money can be tempting, especially during tough times, making it easy to fall for these scams. However, there are safer and more reliable ways to take loans. As a general rule, it is best to avoid borrowing money through online apps unless they are from well-known financial institutions. Google also needs to take responsibility for allowing SpyLoan apps on the Play Store, even when user reviews clearly indicate they are malicious.",

I need to buy a new laptop. What laptop would be a good replacement for me, keeping in mind the cost and the limited usage I would need? What is the most cost-effective way to transfer my data to the new laptop? I have received prices from $100.00 to $200.00 just for the transfer from old to new.

      "Jane's text message exhibits several telltale signs of a scam that everyone should be aware of:",
      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic. Scammers often use specific details to create an illusion of legitimacy, even when these details are unfamiliar to the recipient. This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Brand impersonation: Scammers often employ brand impersonation tactics, using similar logos, fonts and color schemes to create a facade of legitimacy. This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",
      "Requests for personal information: Scammers often ask you to \"confirm\" details like your account number or password. Legitimate banks never request sensitive information via text.",
      "Too good to be true offers: Be skeptical of messages promising large returns or unexpected windfalls.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention.

      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to exploit trusted apps and browser extensions.",
      "Since people tend to trust tools that seem legitimate, attackers use them to spread malware or steal sensitive data. A new report reveals that over 3.2 million users have been affected by a security breach involving malicious browser extensions.",

      "How were the extensions compromised?",
      "GitLab Security has uncovered a major security breach affecting over 3.2 million users through a network of compromised browser extensions, including some linked to GitLab. The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",
      "Originally built for tasks like ad blocking, emoji input and screen recording, these extensions were repurposed through covert updates that exploited the extensive permissions users had granted, enabling real-time manipulation of web activity.",
      "Typically, malicious extensions or apps are created solely to steal data, with their advertised functionality being an afterthought or simply a way to get listed in an official store. That was not the case here. These were legitimate extensions that became harmful only after attackers injected malicious updates into them.",

      "The malicious extensions bypassed Content Security Policy protections, which are designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to modify web content without detection. They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",
      "Some of the compromised extensions listed above have generic names that may resemble well-known and legitimate tools, but they are not the same. For example, \"Password Manager\" in our list refers to a malicious extension identified in the breach,\u00a0not to reputable password manager services we mention here.\u00a0Similarly, extensions named \"AdBlock Plus\" or \"VPN Extension\" in this context are not necessarily the widely trusted versions but rather imitations or malicious variants.",
      "To ensure you're using a legitimate extension, follow these steps.",
      "Verify the developer \u2013 Always check the extension's publisher in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons. Official brands like Norton, Google or Microsoft will be clearly listed.",
      "Check the reviews and downloads \u2013 Malicious extensions often have lower ratings, generic reviews or a small number of downloads compared to their legitimate counterparts.",
      "Avoid third-party sites \u2013 Only install browser extensions directly from trusted sources like the\u00a0Chrome Web Store,\u00a0Mozilla Add-ons or the official website of the developer.",

      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer is no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Browser extensions can improve functionality but also pose significant security risks if not carefully managed. If you have any of the above extensions installed in Chrome, you should remove them immediately. Treat your browser as a key part of your digital security. Regularly check your extensions, remove unnecessary permissions and be cautious about automatic updates, even from trusted sources.",

      "Why should you store your driver's license in Apple Wallet?",
      "Storing your Apple ID in your Apple Wallet may be more secure than carrying a physical card that can be lost easily. Additionally, your digital ID doesn't contain as much visible personal information as a physical ID card. Digital IDs stored in your Apple Wallet do not display personal information other than your full name. To display things such as your address, date of birth and so on, you must sign in with Face ID or Touch ID.",
      "Information is only ever transferred from your Apple Wallet via NFC, which uses an encrypted Bluetooth data connection. This means nothing can be easily or quickly copied. Whenever you have to hand your phone over to a police officer or TSA agent, they won't see your personal information without authentication from you.",
      "Using your digital ID with Apple Wallet from your iPhone or Apple Watch works similarly to Apple Pay. You hold the device near the reader, and a screen will appear telling you exactly which information you will share. Next, you'll double-tap the side button to approve it, as if you were paying with Apple Pay.",

      "WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER CARRY THESE THINGS IN YOUR WALLET",
      "What information is stored in my digital ID?",
      "With digital IDs, only the information needed and nothing more can be transferred easily. For example, a security guard who needs to check your ID at a venue entrance would have a reader that shows your ID photo and confirms if you're over 21. They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",
      "At the time of publishing, police agencies do not accept digital IDs as driver's licenses, so you'll need to have your physical ID when driving. However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs. Additionally, apps that require an ID, such as car rental apps or alcohol delivery services, can use the info stored in your Apple Wallet to provide proof of age.",

      "Why can't I add my driver's license to my Apple Wallet?",
      "If you are unable to add your driver's license to your Apple ID, it's most likely because your state doesn't yet support the feature. If your state is on the list above, but you can't add your license, it may be because of a temporary Apple server outage.\u00a0Apple recommends that you contact the local DMV or state office that issued your card in the event that the servers are not down.",

      "These agreements include the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear arsenal in exchange for assurances over its territorial integrity after its 1991 withdrawal from the Soviet Union, as well as the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership by which Moscow and Kyiv agreed to respect one another\u2019s existing borders. Both deals were first violated in 2014 when Putin seized Crimea and backed Russian separatist forces in the Donbas region.",
      "The 2014-2015 Minsk Agreements, though criticized as \"weak,\" attempted to end Russia\u2019s aggression in eastern Ukraine, an agreement that was never fully achieved and was again violated by Putin's 2022 invasion.",
      "Some world leaders and security officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have cautioned that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely to be achieved in the near term and against Putin\u2019s reliability in adhering to any international agreement without serious security commitments from the West.",
      "\"The problem here is that the Russians only understand win-lose outcomes, which means that to prevent them from ever attacking Ukraine again, they must see themselves to be the losers in the war just as they did at the end of the Cold War,\" Michael Ryan, former deputy assistant secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy and former acting assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Security officials interviewed by Fox News Digital argued that securing Ukraine\u2019s future is not about \"trusting\" Putin. It\u2019s about actually putting Russia in a position where any future violations would hinder Moscow more than it could be enticed by unchecked opportunity.",

      "There are numerous obstacles when it comes to the Trump\u00a0administration\u2019s attempt to negotiate with Putin, including arguments over occupied territory, international recognition of occupied lands, international aid and support for Ukraine, international confiscation of frozen Russian assets, Zelenskyy\u2019s standing at home, the return of prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children, according to Peter Rough, senior fellow and director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at\u00a0the Hudson\u00a0Institute.",
      "\"Putin has officially annexed four Ukrainian oblasts as well as Crimea. But Moscow has yet to conquer any of the four entirely,\" Rough told Fox News Digital while traveling to Ukraine. \"I can\u2019t imagine that Ukraine will withdraw from the areas they control, having fought tooth and nail to defend those regions.",
      "\"I also doubt that the West will offer de jure recognition to the areas Moscow controls,\" he added. \"So, Putin would have to swallow all of that in a peace deal.\"",
      "Each issue alone is a massive undertaking to negotiate, and\u00a0while Ukraine this week may be outlining concessions it could make to secure a deal coordinated by the U.S., Putin is unlikely to do the same, according to Koffler, who briefed NATO years ahead of the 2022 invasion on Putin\u2019s plans.",
      "RUBIO SAYS MINERAL DEAL \u2018NOT MAIN TOPIC ON AGENDA\u2019 IN UKRAINE MEETING",
      "\"Putin is unlikely to make any concessions as he believes he is in a strong position,\" Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"The disparity in combat potential dramatically favors Russia over Ukraine, which is out-manned and outgunned because Putin transitioned the Russian military and economy on a wartime footing seven years prior to the invasion of Ukraine.\"",

      "\"Putin is highly unlikely to agree to a ceasefire because he doesn\u2019t want to give a strategic pause to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO to re-arm,\" Koffler said. \"He doesn\u2019t trust Washington. He doesn\u2019t trust President Trump any more than we trust Putin.",
      "\"He trusts Trump even less than Biden because he could read Biden and predict his behavior. He cannot read Trump because Trump is unpredictable.\"",

      "Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they\u2019ll be sent home.",
      "One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.",
      "\"If we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?\" he asked.",
      "The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees\u2019 home governments.",
      "It\u2019s one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis.",
      "The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them.",
      "A high-profile crackdown",
      "The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.",
      "People from China, Vietnam and Ethiopia, believed to have been trafficked and forced to work in scam centers, sit with their faces masked while in detention after being released from the centers in Myawaddy district in eastern Myanmar, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Thanaphon Wuttison)",
      "\"Your passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,\" a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press.",
      "Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry\u2019s spread.",
      "Beijing began pushing the region's governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release.",
      "Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.",
      "Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar \u2014 the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army \u2014 asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave, and then escorted them out of their compounds.",
      "From forced labor to detention",
      "As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river\u2019s width from freedom.",
      "Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February.",
      "For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights.",
      "Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees' desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards.",
      "\"It felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,\" said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones.",
      "Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP.",

      "Waiting for a $600 plane ticket",
      "Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming.",
      "China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home.",
      "Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move \"as quickly as possible\" to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar.",
      "\"The ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,\" Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.",
      "The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.",
      "Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it\u2019s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren\u2019t free.",
      "\"You can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,\" she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. \"I think what people don\u2019t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.\"",
      "Assistance is scarce",
      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\"When we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\" said Miller. \"It really does require a kind of a global response.\"",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\" said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\"The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\" said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

The bosses, he said, are \"rich as hell\" and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.",
      "\"My friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\" he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \"Is anyone coming for us?\""

      "The crime?",
      "Her teenage brother was caught handing out leaflets that said, \"Lithuania is free.\" After 50 years of Soviet occupation during the Cold War, many Lithuanians today are wary of any negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and are watching the Kremlin\u2019s next moves closely.",

After what was done to my family and by Russia for generations, I don't think you would find any Lithuanian who could trust Vladimir Putin.\"",

      "She said, \"They are trying to frighten us. They are trying to make us feel insecure,\" about the Russian forces next door.",

The U.S. currently spends 3.4%.",

      "Just last week, as a result of Hamas terrorists' refusal to extend the ceasefire deal and start releasing the 59 hostages still held in Gaza, the Israeli government decided to halt all goods and supplies going into Gaza.",
      "Yet despite howls of criticism from U.N. relief chief Tom Fletcher, who called the decision \"alarming,\" the Trump administration has given its blessing to the move.",
      "Retired Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a former IDF international spokesperson and now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, dismissed claims of starvation, telling Fox News Digital that Hamas hoards supplies while Israel ensures aid enters. \"Over 25,200 trucks arrived during the ceasefire \u2013 enough for four months. If there\u2019s hunger, it\u2019s because of Hamas corruption, not a lack of food,\" he said.",

      "The study, named \"Food supplied to Gaza during seven months of the Hamas-Israel war,\" was led by nutrition and public health experts Aron Troen and Ronit Endevelt, along with researchers from multiple Israeli universities and the Ministry of Health. The study analyzed food shipments into Gaza from January to July 2024.",
      "Using international food composition databases and the Sphere humanitarian standards, they tracked calorie intake, nutritional value, and humanitarian aid efforts, providing an objective, data-driven analysis of food supplies delivered to Gaza during the first seven months of the war.",

      "\"We didn't enter politics,\" said professor Ronit Endevelt. \"We just wanted to know if, from a nutritional perspective, the food entering Gaza was sufficient. We double-checked our data multiple times to avoid exaggeration.\"",
      "Between January and April 2024, 14,916 trucks carrying 227,854 tons of food entered Gaza, averaging 124 food trucks per day. The study found that the daily per capita caloric supply averaged 3,374 kcal, with 101 grams of protein and 80.6 grams of fat \u2013 meeting or exceeding international humanitarian food aid standards.",
      "ICC REJECTS ISRAELI APPEALS, ISSUES ARREST WARRANTS FOR BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, YOAV GALLANT",
      "\"In March 2024, the United Nations Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned of imminent famine in Gaza. Within days, cautious technical language gave way to media headlines and political statements claiming mass starvation was already underway,\" professor Troen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"One of the most persistent falsehoods has been the claim that before the war, 500 or more humanitarian trucks entered Gaza daily, and that this number was necessary to meet the population\u2019s needs. In reality, the number of food trucks was around or fewer than 100 per day before the war, and has since increased substantially,\" he continued. \"Our study aimed to address that gap by analyzing verified food shipments. The numbers show that while there were variations, at no point did the food supply drop to starvation levels.\"",

      "When asked specifically about testimonies obtained by Fox News Digital from Gazans who reported struggling to find food on certain days, Endevelt acknowledged the study did not track final distribution within Gaza. \"We can\u2019t say there was no hunger, but we can confirm enough food entered,\" she said. \"Most of the time, in most months, there was enough food available.\"",
      "A key finding of the study is the distinction between food supply and distribution. \"Hamas systematically weaponized food distribution, using it as a tool of control,\" said Endevelt. \"Aid often didn\u2019t reach those in need because Hamas seized supplies, sold them on the black market, or prioritized its own fighters. Reports of famine are not due to a lack of aid but Hamas\u2019 deliberate strategy of restricting access to maintain power and profit.\"",
      "Despite these findings, the ICC investigation and global criticism continued. \"IPC reports, widely cited as evidence against Israel, failed to mention Hamas\u2019 role in manipulating aid,\" Troen said.",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital whether the new findings would be considered in its investigation, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor responded: \"The ICC Office of the Prosecutor has a current and ongoing investigation in relation to the Situation in the State of Palestine.

However, the political climate made the review process unusually intense.\"",
      "\"This was one of the most rigorously reviewed studies I\u2019ve ever worked on,\" Endevelt added. \"We had five reviewers, far more than usual, and months of back-and-forth revisions to ensure absolute accuracy.\"",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-immune-system-brain-swelling-long-term-rcna195918",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "It\u2019s not yet known how many people have gotten sick in the Texas measles outbreak, but there are at least 215 confirmed cases since late January.",
    "story": [
      "Measles isn\u2019t just a rash and a fever.",
      "The disease outbreak in West Texas that continues to grow has sent 29 people, most of them small children, to the hospital. Two people have died, including a 6-year-old child.",
      "It\u2019s not yet known how many people have gotten sick in the outbreak \u2014 there are at least 223 confirmed cases, but experts believe hundreds more people may have been infected since late January. As public health officials try to slow the spread of the highly contagious virus, some experts are worried about longer-term complications.",
      "Measles is unlike other childhood viruses that come and go. In severe cases it can cause pneumonia. About 1 in 1,000 patients develops encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, and there are 1 or 2 deaths per 1,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The virus can wipe out the immune system, a complication called \u201cimmune amnesia.\u201d",
      "When we get sick with viruses or bacteria, our immune systems have the ability to form memories that quickly allow them to recognize and respond to the pathogens if they\u2019re encountered again.",
      "Measles targets cells in the body, such as plasma cells and memory cells, that contain those immunologic memories, destroying some of them in the process.",
      "\u201cNobody escapes this,\u201d said Dr. Michael Mina, a vaccine expert and former professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has led some of the research in the field.",
      "In a 2019 study, Mina and his team found that a measles infection can wreck anywhere from 11% to 73% of a person\u2019s antibody stockpile, depending on how severe the infection.\u00a0 That means that if people had 100 antibodies to chickenpox before they had measles, they may be left with just 50 after measles infections, potentially making them more vulnerable to catching it and getting sicker.",
      "Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at the Yale School of Medicine, said: \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s called amnesia. We forget who the enemies are.\u201d",
      "While virtually everybody who gets infected with measles will have their immune systems weakened, some will be hit harder than others.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no world in which you get measles and it doesn\u2019t destroy some [immunity],\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is does it destroy enough to really make a clinical impact.\u201d",
      "In an earlier study from 2015, Mina estimated that before vaccinations, when measles was common, the virus could have been implicated in as many as half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease, mostly from other diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, diarrheal diseases and meningitis.",
      "The researchers found that after a measles infection, the immune system can be suppressed almost immediately and remain that way for two to three years.",
      "\u201cImmune amnesia really begins as soon as the virus replicates in those [memory] cells,\u201d Mina said.",
      "The best defense against serious complications is the measles vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective in preventing infection.",
      "What is \u2018immune amnesia\u2019?",
      "Our bodies are constantly exposed to a variety of bacteria and viruses in the environment. Over time, our immune systems can learn to remember the specific intruders and spring into action quickly if they find something that doesn\u2019t belong in the body.",
      "\u201cKids are in contact with all sorts of microbes, and most of those encounters don\u2019t lead to illness,\u201d said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatrician and the director of the division of pediatric infectious disease at NYU Langone Health. \u201cThe child will often recover and have memory, so if they see the same strain of a virus that causes diarrhea they will get less sick the second time that they\u2019re exposed to it.\u201d",
      "With immune amnesia, he said, if people are exposed to the same strain of virus again, their bodies behave as if it was the first time and they don\u2019t have that robust protection.",
      "That means the measles virus can destroy the immunity people have built up over time to things like the common cold, the flu, bacteria that can cause pneumonia or any other pathogen.",
      "Mina draws a comparison to HIV, saying the level of immunosuppression in a severe measles infection can be compared to untreated HIV for years. He cautioned, however, that HIV affects different parts of the immune system and that people\u2019s immune systems can eventually recover from measles.",
      "How does measles wreck the immune system?",
      "The highly contagious virus can destroy long-lived plasma cells that reside in our bone marrow and are essential to our immune systems. The cells are like factories that pump out antibodies to protect us from intruders that enter our bodies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like bombing a sacred city,\u201d Mina said, referring to the potential devastation of plasma cells after a measles infection.",
      "Measles also targets cells in our bodies called memory cells, cells that remember what intruders look like so our immune systems can quickly identify and fight them in the future.",
      "Once we breathe in the virus, it gets engulfed by cells called macrophages, which act as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to take the virus to our lymph nodes, Iwasaki said.",
      "Once there, the virus is able to bind to and destroy those memory cells, wiping out some of our built-up immunity in the process.",
      "\u201cOnce [memory cells] are eliminated, we basically don\u2019t have memory for those particular pathogens anymore, so you become more susceptible to pretty much any infection that\u2019s unrelated to measles,\u201d Iwasaki said.",
      "Does the immune system recover?",
      "The way the body starts to regain its immune memory after being walloped by measles is by getting exposed to other viruses and bacteria and becoming sick again, building up immunity.",
      "While such immunity can be relearned, it can lead people to be especially prone to other infections right after measles, said John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cAs every parent of a daycare-old child knows, if you\u2019re building a lot of immunity in that time you\u2019re suffering through it,\u201d Wherry said.",
      "Mina compared relearning our immunity to why it seems babies are frequently sick.",
      "\u201cThat sickness that babies get is not because babies are more fragile. It\u2019s just because they don\u2019t have the same immunological memory set yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to spend a few years to get it built up through exposure, and that\u2019s kind of what people go through after measles.\u201d",
      "How measles can cause brain inflammation",
      "More frightening is an untreatable measles complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease that can occur 10 years or more after someone recovers from the infection and is almost always fatal.",
      "For reasons not well understood, the measles virus can cause a persistent infection that can lead to damage in the brain, resulting in cognitive decline, coma and death.",
      "Researchers believe SSPE, once considered rare, may be more common than realized. A review of measles cases in California from 1998 to 2015 found that SSPE cases occurred at a higher-than-expected rate among unvaccinated children.",
      "The disease is progressive, and symptoms typically occur in phases, said Dr. Bessey Geevarghese, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Northwestern Medicine.",
      "\u201cIt can start with just personality changes and behavioral changes,\u201d she said. In children, it can be something as subtle as worse performance in school.",
      "The disease then progresses and can eventually cause seizures and abnormal movements, Geevarghese said. Finally, parts of the brain that regulate our vital signs, like breathing, heart rate and blood pressure, are damaged, which can lead to death.",
      "There is no cure for the disease, and it is almost always fatal. Patients usually survive one to three years after diagnosis. In the United States, there are typically four to five cases every year, but that may be an underestimate, said Ratner, of NYU Langone Health.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably more common than we think it is, because it\u2019s not necessarily always diagnosed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as these outbreaks become more common, I think we will obviously see more cases of SSPE.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For 17 years, Michelle Arroyo did everything she could to keep her son alive after he\u2019d been diagnosed with brain cancer at 6 years old. The single mom from California moved from Orange County to Los Angeles to be closer to the best doctors and medical facilities, quit her job in real estate to care for her son around-the-clock and liquidated all her financial assets, including her retirement account.",
      "But despite her best efforts, Arroyo\u2019s son, Grayson Arroyo-Smiley, died in 2023 at 22 years old, leaving Arroyo distraught and saddled with mounting medical bills that soared, she said, into the millions. She was also left with a feeling that she\u2019d been swindled by health care companies into having to pay both physically and emotionally for wanting the best for her son.",
      "\u201cThe process is just so overwhelming,\u201d Arroyo said, describing her experience in dealing with the growing number of bills and phone calls with insurance companies.",
      "\u201cIt was like going through this in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never knew what you were going to get. When you are trying to save a loved one\u2019s life, you are not going to ask prices.\u201d",
      "Had she known about those prices up front, Arroyo said, she would have been better able to make more informed decisions about care.",
      "For several years, the federal government has been pushing for more price transparency from hospitals. In 2019, during his first term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at improving price transparency by requiring hospitals and insurers to disclose health care costs upfront. As a result, the Hospital Price Transparency rule went into effect in 2021. The rule made it mandatory for hospitals to post standard charges for their services on their websites.",
      "Compliance, however, has been lacking: One study published in 2022 in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that fewer than 6% of hospitals were fully compliant with the rule. A 2024 report from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services found that just under two-thirds of hospitals sampled complied.",
      "This came despite President Joe Biden signing his own executive order in 2021 to tighten enforcement by fining hospitals that did not comply. When that order went into effect the following year, some hospitals continued to ignore the rules outright, while others accepted the fines, which were capped at $5,500 a day.",
      "Trump is once again trying to increase compliance. In late February, he signed an executive order directing the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and HHS to develop a plan in the next three months to enforce the price transparency rule.",
      "Arroyo said that if this kind of information had been available to her, she would have been able to better financially manage her son\u2019s health care needs and ensure she was getting the value she desired.",
      "\u201cIf the prices were posted for me,\u201d she said, \u201cI would compare the prices I got versus what others got. The fact that others get different prices, it\u2019s not right.\u201d",
      "Arroyo estimated that in the last 10 years of her son's life, she spent hundreds of thousands on one medical supply that cost about $500 a month and fell outside of her insurance\u2019s coverage. She recalled getting another medical bill for $1.5 million for less than 90 days of a five-month stay that her son spent in the ICU. The bills, she said, seemed to never end. Though insurance covered most of them, she says, she consistently had to negotiate the prices down. Today, she said, she is still paying off $14,000 of medical debt.",
      "Because of her professional experience in negotiating real estate contracts, she was able to haggle some services down, but she questions how others could manage a similar experience.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that information, how can you do it?\u201d",
      "Experts are split over price transparency\u2019s effectiveness",
      "Advocates of Trump\u2019s order believe that more transparency in health care prices will lead to increased competition for hospitals and insurers, which, they say, will drive down costs for consumers.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is for hospitals who charge rates that are higher than they should be in the markets they\u2019re in \u2014 this rule change will likely increase scrutiny, and hopefully competition, for them,\u201d said James Gelfand, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee, a national nonprofit organization that represents large employers that pay for their own health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf it works the way the administration hopes it will, those outliers will reduce prices to be more competitive, potentially saving patients and employers tens of billions of dollars over the next decade,\u201d Gelfand said. The order will benefit patients and employers with \u201cmore, better data that can be used to get the best care at the best prices,\u201d he added.",
      "There\u2019s already some evidence that\u2019s already happening.",
      "Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, noted that the costs from some hospitals have already dropped due to the 2019 price transparency rule, pointing to a recent analysis from Turquoise Health, a health care pricing platform.",
      "Other public health experts, however, are wary that one executive order alone can serve as a magic bullet to the challenges in health care cost transparency that have saddled the industry for decades.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any downside, but I don\u2019t think there is any upside either,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who contends that comparing prices in practice for consumers becomes both laborious and complex when it\u2019s based on averages and \u201cno one understands how it works.\u201d",
      "Nearly 100 million Americans \u2014 or 1 in 4 adults \u2014 are hampered by more than $220 billion of medical debt that they cannot afford, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "If the Trump administration can effectively enforce the rule, the beneficiaries will be financially disadvantaged patients, regardless of race, who will gain the most from price competition, while higher-priced hospitals will be harmed the most, public health experts said.",
      "\u201cThere is huge public support for this initiative,\u201d Bai said.",
      "Some of that support comes from an unlikely source: the rapper Fat Joe.",
      "The Bronx-born hip-hop artist is an ambassador for the nonprofit Power to the Patients, an advocacy group that pushes for accessible health care. Through PSAs, public art installations and in-person events, the organization since 2021 has pushed for more price transparency.",
      "Fat Joe said he got involved after learning the scale of the issue and how the lack of transparency was financially crippling people all around him. He\u2019s appeared in commercials, spoke on Capitol Hill and advocated on social media about the need for price transparency virtually since the organization\u2019s inception.",
      "\u201cPeople are tired of these prices\u201d that are often inflated, said Fat Joe, adding that when people go to hospitals for a service, \u201cit\u2019s like a game of lottery, which is really more like Russian roulette.\u201d",
      "Melissa Deitrich, a 49-year-old single woman from Ossian, Indiana, believes she would benefit greatly from greater price transparency. Deitrich, who\u2019s gotten involved with Power to the Patients, said she was overcharged by her provider by more than a thousand dollars for a routine checkup and now drives more than two hours to the closest clinic that lists their prices upfront.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worth the peace of mind,\u201d she said. \u201cComplete price transparency is the only way patients will ever be able to trust their health care system.\u201d",
      "\u2018It\u2019s just not ready for prime time\u2019",
      "Some public health experts, however, are hesitant to oversell the potential transformation the new order could bring. Hospital groups in 2020 opposed to the changes unsuccessfully challenged the previous Trump administration in court, arguing that the requirements would undermine their negotiations with insurers and violate their First Amendment rights.",
      "Denise Anthony, a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan, said that because of the complicated nature of health care pricing, she\u2019s unsure this order will have much of an impact.",
      "\u201cThere is evidence that even when clear pricing data is available to patients, they don\u2019t use it to move to a different hospital/provider,\u201d Anthony said in an email. \u201cThere are all kinds of reasons people go to the same hospital despite lower prices somewhere else \u2014 physician, history, quality, convenience, etc.\u201d",
      "Companies like Handl Health, a platform that uses artificial intelligence to compare health care costs, have firsthand experience in how price transparency can be effective and how it can falter.",
      "The company\u2019s CEO and founder, Ahmed Marmoush, sees promise in Trump\u2019s executive order, but believes the order alone doesn\u2019t go far enough. While pricing data is flooding the market, he says, some health providers \u201chave fallen short of full transparency \u2014 whether by publishing duplicate or misleading rates, omitting key data or making information difficult to access.\u201d",
      "Anderson, of Johns Hopkins, believes the impetus behind the order is positive, but he\u2019s unsure it\u2019s anywhere close to materializing into something real.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s valuable,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not ready for prime time \u2014 and I don\u2019t know how it can ever be ready for prime time.\u201d"

      "ROME \u2014 The recovery of Pope Francis from double pneumonia continued Wednesday as he inched toward notching some important milestones in his papacy: the 12th anniversary Thursday of his election as pope and a near-record in hospital stays for a pontiff.",
      "The Vatican said Wednesday that Francis had a quiet night at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital.",
      "If the last few days are any guide, the 88-year-old Argentine will most likely follow the Vatican\u2019s spiritual retreat remotely while his physical and respiratory therapy continues. The pope\u2019s weekly Wednesday general audience was canceled anyway, since the entire Vatican hierarchy is on retreat this week as part of the Lenten spiritual exercises that have been a mainstay of the Jesuit pope\u2019s pontificate.",
      "Doctors have said Francis is making slow, gradual improvements and this week declared that he\u2019s no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of the complex respiratory infection he had when he was admitted on Feb. 14. But they remain cautious, given the complexity of his condition and overall fragility, and say he needs to remain hospitalized for an unspecified number of days.",
      "Another medical update was expected later Wednesday.",
      "Thursday marks the 12th anniversary of Francis\u2019 election as the 266th pope. The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave that was called after Pope Benedict XVI resigned. While Francis has praised Benedict\u2019s humility in stepping down and said that he too might follow in his footsteps, more recently he has said that the papacy is a job for life.",
      "The Holy See hasn\u2019t said how the anniversary, which is a public holiday in the Vatican, might be commemorated this year.",
      "Another milestone comes Friday, when Francis marks four weeks or 28 days of hospitalization. St. John Paul II has the record for a hospital stay, at 55 days in 1981 when he underwent a minor surgical operation and was then treated for a cytomegalovirus infection. Francis is on track to equal the second-longest stay, 28 days, which John Paul recorded in 1994 when he had surgery to repair his right hip joint after he fractured his right femur in a fall, according to Gemelli hospital.",
      "The Vatican has released no photos or video of Francis since he was admitted. The pope recorded an audio message last week to thank people for their prayers, though the weakness and breathlessness of his voice made clear just how frail he was."

    "story": [
      "Measles isn\u2019t just a rash and a fever.",
      "The disease outbreak in West Texas that continues to grow has sent 29 people, most of them small children, to the hospital. Two people have died, including a 6-year-old child.",
      "It\u2019s not yet known how many people have gotten sick in the outbreak \u2014 there are at least 223 confirmed cases, but experts believe hundreds more people may have been infected since late January. As public health officials try to slow the spread of the highly contagious virus, some experts are worried about longer-term complications.",
      "Measles is unlike other childhood viruses that come and go. In severe cases it can cause pneumonia. About 1 in 1,000 patients develops encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, and there are 1 or 2 deaths per 1,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The virus can wipe out the immune system, a complication called \u201cimmune amnesia.\u201d",
      "When we get sick with viruses or bacteria, our immune systems have the ability to form memories that quickly allow them to recognize and respond to the pathogens if they\u2019re encountered again.",
      "Measles targets cells in the body, such as plasma cells and memory cells, that contain those immunologic memories, destroying some of them in the process.",
      "\u201cNobody escapes this,\u201d said Dr. Michael Mina, a vaccine expert and former professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has led some of the research in the field.",
      "In a 2019 study, Mina and his team found that a measles infection can wreck anywhere from 11% to 73% of a person\u2019s antibody stockpile, depending on how severe the infection.\u00a0 That means that if people had 100 antibodies to chickenpox before they had measles, they may be left with just 50 after measles infections, potentially making them more vulnerable to catching it and getting sicker.",
      "Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at the Yale School of Medicine, said: \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s called amnesia. We forget who the enemies are.\u201d",
      "While virtually everybody who gets infected with measles will have their immune systems weakened, some will be hit harder than others.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no world in which you get measles and it doesn\u2019t destroy some [immunity],\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is does it destroy enough to really make a clinical impact.\u201d",
      "In an earlier study from 2015, Mina estimated that before vaccinations, when measles was common, the virus could have been implicated in as many as half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease, mostly from other diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, diarrheal diseases and meningitis.",
      "The researchers found that after a measles infection, the immune system can be suppressed almost immediately and remain that way for two to three years.",
      "\u201cImmune amnesia really begins as soon as the virus replicates in those [memory] cells,\u201d Mina said.",
      "The best defense against serious complications is the measles vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective in preventing infection.",
      "What is \u2018immune amnesia\u2019?",
      "Our bodies are constantly exposed to a variety of bacteria and viruses in the environment. Over time, our immune systems can learn to remember the specific intruders and spring into action quickly if they find something that doesn\u2019t belong in the body.",
      "\u201cKids are in contact with all sorts of microbes, and most of those encounters don\u2019t lead to illness,\u201d said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatrician and the director of the division of pediatric infectious disease at NYU Langone Health. \u201cThe child will often recover and have memory, so if they see the same strain of a virus that causes diarrhea they will get less sick the second time that they\u2019re exposed to it.\u201d",
      "With immune amnesia, he said, if people are exposed to the same strain of virus again, their bodies behave as if it was the first time and they don\u2019t have that robust protection.",
      "That means the measles virus can destroy the immunity people have built up over time to things like the common cold, the flu, bacteria that can cause pneumonia or any other pathogen.",
      "Mina draws a comparison to HIV, saying the level of immunosuppression in a severe measles infection can be compared to untreated HIV for years. He cautioned, however, that HIV affects different parts of the immune system and that people\u2019s immune systems can eventually recover from measles.",
      "How does measles wreck the immune system?",
      "The highly contagious virus can destroy long-lived plasma cells that reside in our bone marrow and are essential to our immune systems. The cells are like factories that pump out antibodies to protect us from intruders that enter our bodies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like bombing a sacred city,\u201d Mina said, referring to the potential devastation of plasma cells after a measles infection.",
      "Measles also targets cells in our bodies called memory cells, cells that remember what intruders look like so our immune systems can quickly identify and fight them in the future.",
      "Once we breathe in the virus, it gets engulfed by cells called macrophages, which act as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to take the virus to our lymph nodes, Iwasaki said.",
      "Once there, the virus is able to bind to and destroy those memory cells, wiping out some of our built-up immunity in the process.",
      "\u201cOnce [memory cells] are eliminated, we basically don\u2019t have memory for those particular pathogens anymore, so you become more susceptible to pretty much any infection that\u2019s unrelated to measles,\u201d Iwasaki said.",
      "Does the immune system recover?",
      "The way the body starts to regain its immune memory after being walloped by measles is by getting exposed to other viruses and bacteria and becoming sick again, building up immunity.",
      "While such immunity can be relearned, it can lead people to be especially prone to other infections right after measles, said John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cAs every parent of a daycare-old child knows, if you\u2019re building a lot of immunity in that time you\u2019re suffering through it,\u201d Wherry said.",
      "Mina compared relearning our immunity to why it seems babies are frequently sick.",
      "\u201cThat sickness that babies get is not because babies are more fragile. It\u2019s just because they don\u2019t have the same immunological memory set yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to spend a few years to get it built up through exposure, and that\u2019s kind of what people go through after measles.\u201d",
      "How measles can cause brain inflammation",
      "More frightening is an untreatable measles complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease that can occur 10 years or more after someone recovers from the infection and is almost always fatal.",
      "For reasons not well understood, the measles virus can cause a persistent infection that can lead to damage in the brain, resulting in cognitive decline, coma and death.",
      "Researchers believe SSPE, once considered rare, may be more common than realized. A review of measles cases in California from 1998 to 2015 found that SSPE cases occurred at a higher-than-expected rate among unvaccinated children.",
      "The disease is progressive, and symptoms typically occur in phases, said Dr. Bessey Geevarghese, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Northwestern Medicine.",
      "\u201cIt can start with just personality changes and behavioral changes,\u201d she said. In children, it can be something as subtle as worse performance in school.",
      "The disease then progresses and can eventually cause seizures and abnormal movements, Geevarghese said. Finally, parts of the brain that regulate our vital signs, like breathing, heart rate and blood pressure, are damaged, which can lead to death.",
      "There is no cure for the disease, and it is almost always fatal. Patients usually survive one to three years after diagnosis. In the United States, there are typically four to five cases every year, but that may be an underestimate, said Ratner, of NYU Langone Health.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably more common than we think it is, because it\u2019s not necessarily always diagnosed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as these outbreaks become more common, I think we will obviously see more cases of SSPE.\u201d"

      "For 17 years, Michelle Arroyo did everything she could to keep her son alive after he\u2019d been diagnosed with brain cancer at 6 years old. The single mom from California moved from Orange County to Los Angeles to be closer to the best doctors and medical facilities, quit her job in real estate to care for her son around-the-clock and liquidated all her financial assets, including her retirement account.",
      "But despite her best efforts, Arroyo\u2019s son, Grayson Arroyo-Smiley, died in 2023 at 22 years old, leaving Arroyo distraught and saddled with mounting medical bills that soared, she said, into the millions. She was also left with a feeling that she\u2019d been swindled by health care companies into having to pay both physically and emotionally for wanting the best for her son.",
      "\u201cThe process is just so overwhelming,\u201d Arroyo said, describing her experience in dealing with the growing number of bills and phone calls with insurance companies.",
      "\u201cIt was like going through this in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never knew what you were going to get. When you are trying to save a loved one\u2019s life, you are not going to ask prices.\u201d",
      "Had she known about those prices up front, Arroyo said, she would have been better able to make more informed decisions about care.",
      "For several years, the federal government has been pushing for more price transparency from hospitals. In 2019, during his first term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at improving price transparency by requiring hospitals and insurers to disclose health care costs upfront. As a result, the Hospital Price Transparency rule went into effect in 2021. The rule made it mandatory for hospitals to post standard charges for their services on their websites.",
      "Compliance, however, has been lacking: One study published in 2022 in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that fewer than 6% of hospitals were fully compliant with the rule. A 2024 report from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services found that just under two-thirds of hospitals sampled complied.",
      "This came despite President Joe Biden signing his own executive order in 2021 to tighten enforcement by fining hospitals that did not comply. When that order went into effect the following year, some hospitals continued to ignore the rules outright, while others accepted the fines, which were capped at $5,500 a day.",
      "Trump is once again trying to increase compliance. In late February, he signed an executive order directing the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and HHS to develop a plan in the next three months to enforce the price transparency rule.",
      "Arroyo said that if this kind of information had been available to her, she would have been able to better financially manage her son\u2019s health care needs and ensure she was getting the value she desired.",
      "\u201cIf the prices were posted for me,\u201d she said, \u201cI would compare the prices I got versus what others got. The fact that others get different prices, it\u2019s not right.\u201d",
      "Arroyo estimated that in the last 10 years of her son's life, she spent hundreds of thousands on one medical supply that cost about $500 a month and fell outside of her insurance\u2019s coverage. She recalled getting another medical bill for $1.5 million for less than 90 days of a five-month stay that her son spent in the ICU. The bills, she said, seemed to never end. Though insurance covered most of them, she says, she consistently had to negotiate the prices down. Today, she said, she is still paying off $14,000 of medical debt.",
      "Because of her professional experience in negotiating real estate contracts, she was able to haggle some services down, but she questions how others could manage a similar experience.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that information, how can you do it?\u201d",
      "Experts are split over price transparency\u2019s effectiveness",
      "Advocates of Trump\u2019s order believe that more transparency in health care prices will lead to increased competition for hospitals and insurers, which, they say, will drive down costs for consumers.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is for hospitals who charge rates that are higher than they should be in the markets they\u2019re in \u2014 this rule change will likely increase scrutiny, and hopefully competition, for them,\u201d said James Gelfand, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee, a national nonprofit organization that represents large employers that pay for their own health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf it works the way the administration hopes it will, those outliers will reduce prices to be more competitive, potentially saving patients and employers tens of billions of dollars over the next decade,\u201d Gelfand said. The order will benefit patients and employers with \u201cmore, better data that can be used to get the best care at the best prices,\u201d he added.",
      "There\u2019s already some evidence that\u2019s already happening.",
      "Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, noted that the costs from some hospitals have already dropped due to the 2019 price transparency rule, pointing to a recent analysis from Turquoise Health, a health care pricing platform.",
      "Other public health experts, however, are wary that one executive order alone can serve as a magic bullet to the challenges in health care cost transparency that have saddled the industry for decades.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any downside, but I don\u2019t think there is any upside either,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who contends that comparing prices in practice for consumers becomes both laborious and complex when it\u2019s based on averages and \u201cno one understands how it works.\u201d",
      "Nearly 100 million Americans \u2014 or 1 in 4 adults \u2014 are hampered by more than $220 billion of medical debt that they cannot afford, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "If the Trump administration can effectively enforce the rule, the beneficiaries will be financially disadvantaged patients, regardless of race, who will gain the most from price competition, while higher-priced hospitals will be harmed the most, public health experts said.",
      "\u201cThere is huge public support for this initiative,\u201d Bai said.",
      "Some of that support comes from an unlikely source: the rapper Fat Joe.",
      "The Bronx-born hip-hop artist is an ambassador for the nonprofit Power to the Patients, an advocacy group that pushes for accessible health care. Through PSAs, public art installations and in-person events, the organization since 2021 has pushed for more price transparency.",
      "Fat Joe said he got involved after learning the scale of the issue and how the lack of transparency was financially crippling people all around him. He\u2019s appeared in commercials, spoke on Capitol Hill and advocated on social media about the need for price transparency virtually since the organization\u2019s inception.",
      "\u201cPeople are tired of these prices\u201d that are often inflated, said Fat Joe, adding that when people go to hospitals for a service, \u201cit\u2019s like a game of lottery, which is really more like Russian roulette.\u201d",
      "Melissa Deitrich, a 49-year-old single woman from Ossian, Indiana, believes she would benefit greatly from greater price transparency. Deitrich, who\u2019s gotten involved with Power to the Patients, said she was overcharged by her provider by more than a thousand dollars for a routine checkup and now drives more than two hours to the closest clinic that lists their prices upfront.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worth the peace of mind,\u201d she said. \u201cComplete price transparency is the only way patients will ever be able to trust their health care system.\u201d",
      "\u2018It\u2019s just not ready for prime time\u2019",
      "Some public health experts, however, are hesitant to oversell the potential transformation the new order could bring. Hospital groups in 2020 opposed to the changes unsuccessfully challenged the previous Trump administration in court, arguing that the requirements would undermine their negotiations with insurers and violate their First Amendment rights.",
      "Denise Anthony, a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan, said that because of the complicated nature of health care pricing, she\u2019s unsure this order will have much of an impact.",
      "\u201cThere is evidence that even when clear pricing data is available to patients, they don\u2019t use it to move to a different hospital/provider,\u201d Anthony said in an email. \u201cThere are all kinds of reasons people go to the same hospital despite lower prices somewhere else \u2014 physician, history, quality, convenience, etc.\u201d",
      "Companies like Handl Health, a platform that uses artificial intelligence to compare health care costs, have firsthand experience in how price transparency can be effective and how it can falter.",
      "The company\u2019s CEO and founder, Ahmed Marmoush, sees promise in Trump\u2019s executive order, but believes the order alone doesn\u2019t go far enough. While pricing data is flooding the market, he says, some health providers \u201chave fallen short of full transparency \u2014 whether by publishing duplicate or misleading rates, omitting key data or making information difficult to access.\u201d",
      "Anderson, of Johns Hopkins, believes the impetus behind the order is positive, but he\u2019s unsure it\u2019s anywhere close to materializing into something real.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s valuable,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not ready for prime time \u2014 and I don\u2019t know how it can ever be ready for prime time.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump disavowed the Project 2025 policy blueprint during his campaign last year as Democrats attacked the document and its contents. Since then, Trump has invited some of the most prominent contributors to the conservative playbook into his administration.",
      "The document, which outlined a vision for a future Republican presidency, generally foreshadowed Trump\u2019s sweeping moves to slash government agencies and cut federal funding in his first weeks in office, though there are also areas of departure.",
      "As the dust settles after a whirlwind of Cabinet nominations, confirmation hearings and early administration actions, here\u2019s where some prominent authors and contributors involved in Project 2025 have landed in the Trump administration.",
      "Russell Vought",
      "As a principal author of Project 2025, Vought \u2014 Trump\u2019s pick to direct the Office of Management and Budget in his first and second terms \u2014 wrote a chapter outlining plans to overhaul the executive branch and refocus federal agencies to serve the president\u2019s agenda. In his chapter, Vought referred to OMB as \u201cthe president\u2019s air-traffic control system,\u201d with its director tasked with serving as \u201cthe keeper of \u2018commander\u2019s intent.\u2019\u201d",
      "Vought wrote in the section that the next administration would require \u201cboldness to bend or break bureaucracy to the presidential will\u201d and \u201cself-denial\u201d to send power from Washington back to the hands of American families.",
      "\u201cThe overall situation is constitutionally dire, unsustainably expensive, and in urgent need of repair,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNothing less than survival of self-governance is at stake.\u201d",
      "In a memo to the heads of the White House budget and personnel management offices late last month, Vought and Charles Ezell, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, directed the agencies to brace for mass layoffs. The memo said the federal government is \u201ccostly, inefficient, and deeply in debt.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the same time, it is not producing results for the American public,\u201d they wrote. \u201cInstead, tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups while hurting hard-working Americans.\u201d",
      "Peter Navarro",
      "Trump selected Navarro, a longtime former aide, in December to be his senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. Navarro spent four months in prison last year after he was found in contempt of Congress for not complying with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "In his section of the policy road map, Navarro outlined a plan to raise tariffs on the European Union, China and India to balance the U.S. trade deficit. Navarro \u2014 whom Trump called his \u201ctough guy on China\u201d during his 2016 campaign \u2014 also listed dozens of policy recommendations for responding to Chinese \u201caggression,\u201d including banning Chinese-owned social media apps like TikTok\u00a0and holding China \u201caccountable\u201d for the Covid-19 virus.",
      "\u201cIf the new U.S. President wishes to defend this country against the serious existential threat posed by Communist China, that President will adopt all of these proposals through the requisite presidential executive orders and memoranda,\u201d Navarro wrote.",
      "Trump moved forward with his promises to roll out a series of sweeping tariffs last week, placing tariffs on all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico and threatening a trade war with the country\u2019s closest trading partners. But one of his first moves in office was to issue an executive order delaying a TikTok ban that was due to take place under federal law.",
      "Brendan Carr",
      "Carr, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, wrote the Project 2025 chapter outlining a series of reforms to the FCC \u2014 specifically ending \u201cwasteful spending policies,\u201d addressing TikTok\u2019s threat to the United States and reining in big tech companies.",
      "\u201cThe FCC should engage in a serious top-to-bottom review of its regulations and take steps to rescind any that are overly cumbersome or outdated,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Since he took the helm of the FCC as chairman in January, Carr has opened probes into major telecommunication companies like Verizon and Comcast to ensure they aren\u2019t \u201cpromoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC and civil rights laws.\u201d (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, which is the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "Carr has been an FCC commissioner since 2017 and was unanimously confirmed to another five-year term in 2023.",
      "In a string of emails from 2022 obtained by Bloomberg, Carr expressed interest in writing a chapter for the book and agreed to participate after an internal FCC ethics review determined it wouldn\u2019t be considered political activity, as it was unpaid, and therefore wouldn\u2019t violate the Hatch Act.",
      "Adam Candeub",
      "Candeub, the newly anointed general counsel for the FCC, wrote a Project 2025 chapter scrutinizing the Federal Trade Commission, arguing for a \u201cbroader\u201d view of antitrust laws that move beyond a \u201cpurely economic understanding\u201d of competitive markets.",
      "\u201cAntitrust law can combat dominant firms\u2019 baleful effects on democratic institutions such as free speech, the marketplace of ideas, shareholder control, and managerial accountability as well as collusive behavior with government,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Candeub was head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration during Trump\u2019s first term before he was chosen to be deputy associate attorney general in the final weeks of that administration. He has been a critical voice in Trump\u2019s moves to target social media companies with claims of anti-conservative bias, railing against Twitter and Facebook over allegations that they were censoring conservative views in 2020.",
      "Other contributors",
      "Among the list of nearly 300 contributors preceding the playbook, a number of other people have also landed in Trump\u2019s administration. Border czar Tom Homan gets a credit in the book, as do Brian J. Cavanaugh, the associate director for homeland security at OMB, and James Baehr, general counsel for the Department of Veteran Affairs.",
      "Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins and OMB senior adviser Stephen Billy are also among the Project 2025 alums who now staff the Trump administration \u2014 with Atkins getting a special mention in a chapter on financial regulatory agencies and Billy getting a credit in Vought\u2019s section on the executive branch."

      "Price growth was set to have cooled slightly in February, forecasters said in advance of the latest Consumer Price Index report, but President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies are already threatening to derail things.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly inflation report early Wednesday. A survey of analysts by Dow Jones said a more closely watched inflation measure that strips out more volatile food and energy items was expected to have eased from 0.4% to 0.3% on the month and from 3.3% to 3.2% over the past year.",
      "Economists were looking for the broader CPI measure to slow even further amid falling fuel prices.",
      "Trump entered office promising to reduce prices. Yet most mainstream economists say they believe that is an impossible goal to accomplish \u2014 at least in a responsible way \u2014 as long as he also insists on implementing tariffs.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump once again doubled down on a tariffs threat, promising to push steel and aluminum duties up to 50% amid Canada\u2019s insistence on charging a 25% surcharge on electricity imports for some U.S. states on its immediate southern border.",
      "Despite all the tariff threats, Trump has implemented only supplemental trade levies on China totaling 20%, plus 25% duties on a handful of goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact.",
      "Yet Trump\u2019s remarks alone have been enough to cause a wave of uncertainty to ripple throughout the U.S. economy, upending spending plans of consumers and businesses alike.",
      "\u201cWe have massive cross-currents,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s analytics, told NBC News. \u201cWe have tariffs that will add to inflation but then a weaker economy that is detracting. My sense is that we\u2019re not going to see further progress toward the [Federal Reserve\u2019s] 2% inflation goal in the near future.\u201d",
      "The United States will be lucky to get back to within half a percentage point of the 2% threshold, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just not going back\u201d to 2%, he said. \u201cThe only reason why we would go back to that target is if the economy really gets nailed here and stalls out \u2014 you don\u2019t\u00a0even need a recession. Inflation could come in, but it would be for the wrong reasons, because the economy is falling apart.\u201d",
      "In its most recent survey of small businesses, released Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Businesses said the net percentage of owners raising average selling prices rose 10 points from January to a net 32% \u2014 the largest monthly increase since April 2021 and the third highest in the survey\u2019s history. The percentage of owners lowering their prices is 10 points lower than it was one year ago. Meanwhile, a net 29% said they planned to raise prices in the next three months, up 3 points from January and the highest reading in 11 months.",
      "\u201cInflation remains a major problem, ranked second behind the top problem, labor quality,\u201d\u00a0NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in the release.",
      "A separate monthly survey of consumer expectations released this week by the New York Federal Reserve found the median inflation expectation increased by 0.1 percentage point at the one-year horizon to 3.1% and remained unchanged at the three-year and five-year horizons, both at 3.0%.",
      "There is still disagreement about whether inflation expectations remain \u201canchored\u201d and thus how the Federal Reserve is set to respond to ongoing changes in the economy \u2014 that is, whether it will keep broad borrowing costs higher or lower. Analysts with Citi expect continued progress on slowing inflation, despite Trump\u2019s rhetoric, and see interest rates falling by as much as 125 basis points, or 1.25%, from their current levels this year.",
      "Others disagree.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate [February data] will show the first signs of President Trump\u2019s 10% China tariff hike on core goods, alongside resilient non-shelter services inflation that may stay boosted by residual seasonality effects,\u201d analysts with BNP Paribas financial group said in a note to clients."

      "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 A Louisiana woman pleads not guilty Tuesday to a felony, after allegedly getting abortion pills from a New York doctor and giving them to her teenage daughter to terminate a pregnancy.",
      "The woman\u2019s arraignment is part of a cross-state legal battle that involves what may be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, putting Louisiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban in tension with New York\u2019s shield laws.",
      "In January, a West Baton Rouge grand jury unanimously issued an indictment against the 39-year-old Louisiana woman for criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, which is a felony. The woman has not been publicly identified by The Associated Press to protect the identity of the minor.",
      "The indictment in Louisiana came months after the state became the first to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 a two-drug regimen that can be used to end pregnancies through the 10th week \u2014 as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective.",
      "Pills have become the most common method of abortion in the U.S. and are at the center of political and legal fights over abortion access following the overturning of Roe. Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. since state bans started taking effect.",
      "According to District Attorney Tony Clayton, last year the woman requested abortion medication online from New York-based Dr. Margaret Carpenter, for her daughter. Clayton said the request was made through a questionnaire only and no consultation with the teen.",
      "A \u201ccocktail of pills\u201d was mailed to the woman who directed her daughter to take them, Clayton said.",
      "After taking the drug, the girl experienced a medical emergency, called 911 and was transported to the hospital where she was treated. While responding to the emergency, a police officer learned about the pills and under further investigation found that an out-of-state doctor had supplied the drugs and turned their findings over to Clayton\u2019s office.",
      "The Baton Rouge jury also indicted Carpenter, who is facing the same felony charge as the Louisiana woman. The indictment triggered Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to send a formal extradition order to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "Under Louisiana law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "Landry demanded that Carpenter be turned over to Louisiana and face the state\u2019s justice system. Hochul refused, saying she would not sign the order: \u201cNot now, not ever.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Texas State District Judge Bryan Gantt ordered Carpenter to pay a $100,000 penalty as well as attorneys fees for allegedly breaking a Texas law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine."

      "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A Texas appeals court on Tuesday halted the execution of a man who has spent more than 30 years on death row and had been set to die by lethal injection this week over the killings of six girls and young women found buried in the desert near El Paso.",
      "It was the second scheduled execution in the U.S. halted on Tuesday after a federal judge stopped Louisiana\u2019s first death row execution using nitrogen gas, which was to take place next week.",
      "In Texas, the order was another reprieve for David Leonard Wood, who in 2009 was about 24 hours away from execution when it was halted over claims he is intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for execution.",
      "Those claims were later rejected by a judge and Wood, 67, had been set to die Thursday. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state\u2019s highest criminal court, issued a stay of execution after his latest appeal, which renewed his claims of innocence.",
      "The court put Wood\u2019s execution on pause \u201cuntil further order.\u201d It did not elaborate on the decision in a brief three-page order.",
      "Had Wood been executed this week, he would have spent 32 years and two months on Texas\u2019 death row, the longest time a Texas inmate has waited before being put to death.",
      "The 1987 murders remained unsolved for several years until authorities say Wood bragged to a cellmate that he was the so-called \u201cDesert Killer.\u201d The victims\u2019 bodies were found buried in shallow graves in the same desert area northeast of El Paso.",
      "Authorities said Wood gave rides to the victims and then drove them into the desert, where he sexually assaulted and killed them. The victims were Rosa Casio and Ivy Williams, both 23; Karen Baker, 21; Angelica Frausto, 17; Desiree Wheatley, 15; and Dawn Smith, 14.",
      "Two other girls and a young woman were also reported missing but were never found.",
      "Wood, a repeat convicted sex offender who had worked as a mechanic, has long maintained his innocence.",
      "\u201cI did not do it. I am innocent of this case. I\u2019ll fight it,\u201d Wood said in recent documents filed in his appeals.",
      "On March 4, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles declined a request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty or grant him a 90-day reprieve.",
      "His lawyers have for years sought to have hundreds of pieces of evidence tested for DNA after testing in 2011 of bloodstains on the clothing Smith wore found a male DNA profile that was not Wood. The Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office has fought against new DNA tests and various courts have denied Wood\u2019s request for it.",
      "Prior to the court\u2019s decision Tuesday, Gregory Wiercioch, one of Wood\u2019s attorneys, said that when authorities identified Wood as a suspect, they focused on him and not on the evidence they had.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to make it clear to the courts that he\u2019s innocent, and we\u2019ll see if anyone listens,\u201d Wiercioch said."

      "The SPHEREx mission (short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer) is designed to map the entire celestial sky, studying hundreds of millions of galaxies and piecing together how the universe formed and evolved.",
      "The launch had been postponed several times since late February to give engineers more time to assess the rocket and its components, according to NASA, and most recently because of bad weather at the launch site.",
      "The cone-shaped spacecraft finally lifted off at roughly 8:10 p.m. PT Tuesday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. Also along for the ride into orbit were four suitcase-sized satellites that NASA will deploy on a separate mission to study the sun.",
      "The $488 million SPHEREx observatory will survey the whole sky four times over its two-year mission. Its instruments will observe the cosmos in 102 different colors, or wavelengths, which NASA has said is more than any previous mission.",
      "Colors in the infrared range are essentially invisible to humans because infrared light has longer wavelengths than what the eye can see. In space, however, infrared light from stars, galaxies and other celestial objects carries key information about their composition, density, temperature and chemical makeup.",
      "A technique known as spectroscopy allows scientists to analyze infrared light, dividing it into different colors much like how a prism can separate sunlight into a colorful rainbow. Data gathered by the SPHEREx observatory will give researchers insight into the chemistry and other characteristics of hundreds of millions of galaxies in the universe.",
      "NASA said the observations could help scientists study how galaxies form, trace the origins of water in the Milky Way and piece together what happened after the\u00a0Big Bang, which created the universe\u00a0around 13.8 billion years ago."

      "When the two met at the final bonfire, Brion immediately grabbed Shant\u00e9\u2019s hands and pulled her into an embrace. He apologized and sobbed. Walberg explained that they each would be able to speak their minds, uninterrupted, before having a conversation where they could ask all the questions they needed to.",
      "Shant\u00e9 went first, recalling that Brion brought her on the show because he wanted to prove he could have platonic relationships with women. She said his actions made her feel worthless and that their love never mattered to him. She added that he didn\u2019t behave like a man who deserves her and that she also saw clips of him disrespecting the women in his villa.",
      "Brion repeatedly apologized and told Shant\u00e9 he loved her. He said that the man he was before the experiment was \u201cfake\u201d and a \u201csurface-level boyfriend.\u201d He said he wanted to show her he had changed and was ready to be the boyfriend, future husband and father she deserved.",
      "What did they decide? Brion announced his decision first. He said wanted to leave with Shant\u00e9 and build back her trust. After stepping away for a moment and being consoled by a producer, Shant\u00e9 returned to share her decision. She said she wanted to respect herself and potentially see this new version of him, but she had to choose herself for now.",
      "While Brion said he understood, he added that he would\u2019ve never crossed their boundaries in real life. Shant\u00e9 then changed her mind and decided to leave with Brion.",
      "She explained her change of heart, telling the cameras, \u201cI believe in our love. I think that we can make this something special. And I am happy with my decision.\u201d",
      "Tyler and Tayler",
      "Tyler signed up for \u201cTemptation Island\u201d because he wanted to prove to Tayler that she could trust him. But during his time on the show, Tyler quickly developed a connection with cast member Kay Carlson. The two shared kisses and multiple intimate moments.",
      "Tayler arrived at the final bonfire first. When Tyler approached her, he asked for a hug. She shook her head, a glimpse of the icy interaction that followed. She pulled out a letter to share her thoughts on Tyler\u2019s behavior during the experiment. She said she felt \u201cplayed\u201d and that his actions were \u201churtful and extremely disrespectful\u201d to their relationship. Tayler spoke about her growth on the island and said Tyler wouldn\u2019t get to know the new version of her.",
      "Tyler mentioned the bonfire clips he saw that hurt him, particularly a video of Tayler saying he had \u201cb---- tendencies.\u201d He said he felt \u201cclowned\u201d listening to her description and said that she took advantage of his insecurities. He also acknowledged his relationship with Kay, saying that she tempted him and opened his mind to new ideas.",
      "Tayler pointed out it only took 72 hours for him to forget about her. He countered that it was because he realized he could never be the man she hoped he would become.",
      "What did they decide? After tearfully telling Tyler that he was her \u201chome\u201d and \u201csafe place\u201d before they landed on the island, she said it was \u201cgutting\u201d seeing him fall in love with Kay. So, the rest of the experiment she focused on herself and said she realized she wanted to feel chosen. She said that she needed to choose herself and wanted to leave the island alone.",
      "Tyler said he knew their relationship was over and wanted to leave the island with Kay. Tayler wished him the best and walked away. In her final confessional, Tayler said she didn\u2019t feel like she lost anything because of the connections she built.",
      "Kay then joined Tyler, who gushed about her while pointing out their relationship was still in the honeymoon stage. He asked her to leave the island with him and Kay agreed. She told the cameras she was happy to learn that their connection on the island was genuine.",
      "Ashley and Grant",
      "Ashley and Grant, another couple who dealt with infidelity before coming on the show, also struggled during the experiment. Ashley watched clips at the bonfire of multiple sexual encounters between Grant and tempter Natalie Cruz.",
      "At the final bonfire, Ashley put her hand up and said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s OK,\u201d when Grant attempted to greet her with a hug. They glared at each other in silence before Walberg asked Grant to speak first.",
      "Grant said that he had \u201cenjoyed chasing\u201d Ashley for most of their relationship but he couldn\u2019t do it anymore because she was \u201cunobtainable.\u201d He expressed his love for her and lamented hurting her. But he said that he felt disrespected and belittled in their relationship.",
      "Ashley began by saying she didn\u2019t have a lot she wanted to talk about. She said she wished Grant had been honest with her before they came on the show and admitted he didn\u2019t have the ability to stay loyal to her. She mentioned that it only took a few days for Grant to cheat on her. \u201cYou\u2019re a serial cheater,\u201d she told him.",
      "He said he went through an emotional rollercoaster as he tried to figure out why their relationship didn\u2019t work. He revealed he had been \u201cforcing\u201d their connection for a long time and that he should\u2019ve called it quits.",
      "What did they decide? Despite his budding connection with Natalie, Grant announced that he wanted to leave the island alone. Ashley said she wanted to depart with her new connection, tempter Danny Spongberg. As Grant cried, she told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting and I\u2019m sorry that we got to this place. I wanted you to be a good man for me and it just wasn\u2019t working.\u201d",
      "They hugged before Grant left. He told the cameras that he liked Natalie but he needed to take time to figure out how to be alone.",
      "Danny entered and Ashley told him she wanted to pursue their connection. He said he wanted to leave with her, too, and they kissed. She praised him for helping bring out a light within her that she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.",
      "Alexa and Lino",
      "Alexa and Lino were the only couple to remain faithful throughout the experiment despite the trust issues they revealed in Episode 1. When they first started dating, Alexa was seeing other people even though she told Lino they were exclusive. Throughout their relationship, Lino felt like he was a second option, causing tension between them.",
      "As soon as Alexa saw Lino at the final bonfire, she became emotional. They kissed and repeatedly expressed how much they loved and missed each other. Alexa told him that she grew more on the island than she could\u2019ve ever imagined. She said she felt \u201cempty\u201d when they arrived and she thought that was because she was co-dependent in their relationship. But she realized that she is independent and she felt empty because their connection is so special.",
      "She added that she appreciated him, but he could not continue to hold her past decisions over her head.",
      "Lino\u2019s response was concise. He said he thought the show would be a wild and insightful journey but it ended up being \u201carduous.\u201d He learned that he projected his insecurities onto her and apologized. Going forward, he wanted to provide the emotional support she needed and\u00a0said he would leave his trust issues on the island.",
      "What did they decide? Alexa and Lino revealed they wanted to leave together. She told him, \u201cI want to leave with you, the love of my life. There\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather choose.\u201d",
      "He replied, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person on the earth that I would leave this island with. You\u2019re the love of my life and the light of my life.\u201d",
      "Walberg congratulated them and the two left, hand in hand. They rounded the corner and saw a path of flowers and candles. Lino took Alexa\u2019s hands and said, \u201cFrom the first moment I saw you all those years ago, I knew you\u2019d be mine.\u201d He gushed that she was the most beautiful and kind woman he had ever known. He promised to cherish her before kneeling to one knee and proposing.",
      "She covered her face and happily said yes. The two popped champagne and toasted before he thanked \u201cTemptation Island\u201d for helping him gain a fianc\u00e9e."

      "In a new interview with Rolling Stone, the 22-year-old singer recalls not feeling connected to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\u00adday Saints, despite his upbringing.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, a lot of people at church would talk about these experiences that they\u2019ve had and these personal revelations and feelings and voices. I never felt it as physically present as they did, and so I was always confused and frustrated,\u201d he told the magazine in a new interview released March 11. \u201cI was always scared to bring that up to people because I just didn\u2019t want to accept that, like, I wasn\u2019t feeling what everyone else was feeling.\u201d",
      "When he shared his thoughts with his friend, they replied, \u201cThank goodness. I feel the same way.\u201d",

      "\u201c\u200aI don\u2019t want to be a part of one religion. I have my own opinions. Some are from this religion, some are from this religion, some are from no religion,\u201d he explained.",

      "\u201c\u200aMy parents definitely have their own views, but when it comes to religion and God, they want me to figure it out on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whatever I come to, and whatever I feel is right, that\u2019s what they want for me.\u201d",
      "And while he doesn\u2019t consider himself Mormon, he told the magazine that he still abstains from alcohol and drugs. He has, however, had coffee, which is forbidden in the religion, but doesn\u2019t enjoy it.",
      "\u201c\u200aThere was a period of time where I really wanted to like coffee and (would) go out to this place in L.A. with (my girlfriend) Maggie (Thurmon),\u201d he shared. \u201cAnd I would try sips of her coffee every day and it literally tastes like burnt wood.\u201d",
      "But part of his own journey is also deciding for himself to stay away from any addictive substance because of his personality and health.",
      "\u201c\u200aI just think for me personally, like, dude, I would die,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Cause I have such an addictive personality. I feel like if I started, I would do it so much that my health would just decline and I wouldn\u2019t enjoy touring as much.\u201d",
      "And when it comes to making decisions outside of his former religion, the Grammy-nominated artist said he considers his biggest weakness to be his biggest strength, which is, \u201cWhen I convince my brain of something, I have to do it. There\u2019s no backing out or stepping down.\u201d",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Boone attended Brigham Young University, a private Mormon university, for a semester before dropping out to pursue a music career.",
      "He would go on to audition for Season 19 of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d making it to the top 24 \u2014 before also exiting the show. At the time, Boone felt that the show would hold him back than help him have a real music career.",
      "The singer appears to have made a great move with the release of \u201cBeautiful Things,\u201d which would go on to become the most-streamed track in the world in 2024, according to Rolling Stone."

      "He was a basketball star at Princeton",
      "Robinson attended Princeton University and made a name for himself on the Princeton Tigers basketball team. In fact, the two-time Ivy League Player of the Year (1981-1982 and 1982-1983), still ranks as the seventh highest scorer in in the team\u2019s history with 1,441 points accrued over the course of his NCAA career.",

      "After his two-season tenure with the Manchester Giants, Robinson returned to the U.S. and briefly gave coaching a go before leaving the court behind and getting his M.B.A. in 1992.",

      "Silikovitz, an attorney and \u201cworldwide karaoke singer\u201d originally from New Jersey, appeared on the March 10 episode, in which he upended reigning champ Laura Faddah\u2019s eight-day winning streak.",
      "He told the show\u2019s host Ken Jennings about how long he had been trying to have a chance to play on the show.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a longtime dream of mine to get here,\u201d Silikovitz said. \u201cIn 2019, I was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, but I continued chasing the dream, and now here I am.\u201d",

I would like to give hope and inspiration to the people who are living with chronic illnesses.\u201d",
      "He shared more about what led him to the show in a March 8 post on Instagram \u2014 starting with his love of travel, so he can learn more about the world.",
      "\u201cThat same voracious curiosity led me to become immersed in the world of trivia,\u201d he wrote in the caption. \u201cWhile I believe that knowing stuff is an intrinsic good, I also enjoy testing my knowledge in trivia competitions of various kinds.\u201d",
      "He shared that he always wanted to test his skills on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d and that he had tried for years to become a contestant on the show.",
      "\u201cI persevered in that quest even after setbacks \u2014 like that time in March 2019 when I missed a voice-mail from a senior casting producer that, had I returned the call, would have led to my becoming a contestant a few weeks later,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time I finally heard the VM, taping for the season had wrapped.\u201d",
      "A few months later, Silikovitz was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, a brain disorder that causes unintended and uncontrollable movements, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cBut I refused to let that diagnosis deter me from following my long-held dream,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked hard to manage my Parkinson\u2019s symptoms \u2014 even while relentlessly seeking to improve my knowledge base as well as my proficiency at the skills, such as timing on the buzzer, that are crucial to success on J!\u201d",
      "And in late January 2025, his dream came true when he flew out to Culver City, California, to film the episode that would air on March 10.",
      "\u201cSo how did I do? Can a person with Parkinson\u2019s be competitive in the rigorous crucible of a \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 game? To add to the intrigue, the returning champion who was one of my 2 opponents had won her first 8 games,\u201d he said. \u201cDid I become another of her victims? Did I put an end to her streak? Or did the third player take down both of us? Tune in on Monday to find out!\u201d",
      "And as TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager said, Silikovitz didn\u2019t just compete \u2014 he won \u201cin a big way,\u201d she said on TODAY\u2019s Morning Boost on March 11.",
      "\u201cHe landed more than $23,000, and landed a lot of hearts, right?\u201d she said.",

      "Chuck E. Cheese has recently overhauled its brand, bringing major changes to its nearly 500 locations that longtime visitors might be surprised to see. The biggest? The removal of its iconic animatronic band.",
      "As the family-friendly entertainment and restaurant chain, which was founded in 1977, looks to welcome the next generation of children, it has modernized and chosen to leave Mr. Munch, Pasqually P. Pieplate and more members of Munch\u2019s Make Believe Band in the past.",
      "Chuck E. Cheese Entertainment CEO David McKillips explained why the furry friends are no longer at every location and if they could make a return in a recent interview with NBC News correspondent Savannah Sellers.",
      "McKillips, who has been the CEO of the company since January 2020, navigating Chuck E. Cheese through bankruptcy, corporate restructuring and the COVID-19 pandemic. After McKillips and his team received a $350 million investment, they decided to use the money to attract younger and older generations. In response, ticketing became electronic, more adult menu items were offered and new play areas with obstacle courses and trampoline zones were installed.",
      "As of January, its birthday business is back to pre-pandemic levels. The company also launched a subscription program last year that includes unlimited visits and discounts on food, drinks and games.",
      "While the company kept and updated many fan-favorites \u2014 including adding thousands of new games to its arcades \u2014 it also eliminated the animatronic band. It didn\u2019t align with the more modern vision, McKillips said. He revealed that there were \u201cmany meetings and debates and conversations\u201d before the decision was made to get rid of the singing group.",
      "\u201cOf course, if you think about entertainment 47 years ago, it was incredible to have the animatronic band and new music,\u201d he told Sellers. \u201cBut in reality, the animatronics were getting tired.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cKids are consuming entertainment on a digital platform.\u201d",
      "Now at locations around the country, children can interact with digital versions of Chuck E. and Munch\u2019s Make Believe Band during a jumbo screen show. There is also an interactive multimedia dance floor where kids can groove and jump around as different images appear.",

      "In May 2024, The New York Times reported that fans would need to bid farewell to the animatronic band. The newspaper shared that\u00a0 Munch\u2019s Make Believe Band was being phased out by the end of 2024. At the time, the Times said only two locations, one in Los Angeles and a second in Nanuet, New York, would keep the band.",

      "The news came after the success of the horror mystery film \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d which was based on a popular video game series and features animatronics. The film, starring Josh Hutcherson, was released in October 2023 and grossed over $290 million worldwide. Variety reported in May 2024 that a sequel will arrive in December 2025.",
      "McKillips said that the decision to remove Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s animatronics came \u201cwell before\u201d the horror movie\u2019s box office triumph. But, he acknowledged \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d did affect the restaurant chain.",
      "\u201cIt had some impact regarding the brand overall,\u201d he said about the film. \u201cObviously, the inspiration from the movie was based on, you know, the legacy of Chuck E. Cheese.\u201d",
      "Unlike the flick, however, he assured, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing scary about our animatronics whatsoever.\u201d (Sure, McKillips, sure.)",
      "So, where did the Munch\u2019s Make Believe Bands in the other hundreds of locations relocate to? McKillips only told Sellers that they went \u201caway\u201d after she asked if they were being stored in a warehouse people would not want to visit at night.",
      "He encouraged devoted Chuck E. Cheese fans who wish to see them again to visit the restaurant chain in Northridge, California for a special show.",
      "\u201cIf you get out there, it\u2019s really spectacular,\u201d McKillips said before adding that the Munch\u2019s Make Believe Band could come back to other locations in the future.",

Additionally, Lino has moved three times for Alexa's job, making him feel like his life is in limbo.",

      "Greer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",
      "They were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when Khalil\u2019s wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he was not there \u2014 and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.",
      "\u201cWe have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,\u201d Greer told the AP. \u201cThis is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.\u201d",

      "\u201cKhalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\u201d McLaughlin said.",

      "Messages seeking comment were left Sunday with the State Department and ICE.",
      "In a\u00a0message\u00a0shared on X Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration \u201cwill be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d",
      "DHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.",
      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",
      "Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.",
      "He was also among those\u00a0under investigation by a new Columbia University office\u00a0that has brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students for their pro-Palestinian activism, according to records shared with the AP.",

      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \u201cunauthorized marching event\u201d in which participants glorified Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.",
      "\u201cI have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,\u201d Khalil told the AP last week.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of civilians have been killed in Syria in the last 48 hours, the deadliest eruption of violence since the fall of the Assad regime in December.",
      "The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reports that at least 830 civilians have been killed in what it described as \u201cthe largest collective act of revenge in the coast and its mountains,\u201d with the death toll expected to rise.",
      "More than 1,300 people have been killed in 72 hours, according to the organization, including security force members and militants.",
      "It is unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians, with reports of different militias converging in the area, and much remains unknown about what is unfolding in Syria. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for peace Sunday, amid reports of executions, firing squads and bodies piled in the streets.",
      "Clashes between Syrian government forces and fighters loyal to the deposed dictator, Bashar al-Assad, have also led to hundreds more deaths on both sides.",
      "The violence has been concentrated in the coastal areas of Tartus and Latakia, the home of the Alawite community, a small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. According to the SOHR, the vast majority of the civilian dead appear to be Alawites, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d for the killings and urged Syria\u2019s leadership to hold them accountable.",
      "Syria\u2019s presidency announced its decision a statement Sunday to form an independent national committee to investigate the events on the Syrian coast, including \"causes, circumstances, and conditions\" that led to the event. The statement also promised to \"identify those responsible.\"",
      "But as the nation grapples with this surge in violence, here\u2019s what we know about what\u2019s happening on the ground and what it could mean for Syria\u2019s future.",
      "What we know",
      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said that the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0the escalation is \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, challenging Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "But in recent elections, Alice Weidel took the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from the fringes to the heart of power. Championed by Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, Weidel is part of a growing group of powerful women leading Europe\u2019s ascendant far-right parties, alongside Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen.",
      "With party co-chair Tino Chrupalla, Weidel led the AfD to second place in Germany\u2019s election last month, a triumph for a party being monitored by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",
      "\u201cNobody has done this in Europe in such a short time,\u201d a beaming Weidel said at a news conference after her party secured just over 20% of the vote, doubling its share from 2021.

(Officially, she is registered as a resident of \u00dcberlingen, in Germany, just over the border from Switzerland.)",
      "The AfD has opposed gay marriage and the expansion of laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but Weidel has said her sexuality does not conflict with the AfD\u2019s traditional values, and analysts say the party\u2019s rank and file are prepared to overlook her family life as long as she brings them success.",
      "Before entering politics, Weidel was a consultant for Goldman Sachs and Allianz Global Investors, a slice of her background that appeals to those in the AfD who seek to appear both more moderate than its most anti-immigrant flank and more practical, though she has championed the AfD\u2019s populist economic platform of big tax cuts and steep increases in public spending."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 As President Donald Trump gave a fiery and divisive speech to a joint session of Congress last week, a much more staid political event was underway on the other side of the world.",
      "The annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s parliament, is tightly choreographed, with all decisions made in advance by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Security is even tighter than usual around central Beijing and armies of volunteers wearing red armbands are stationed on street corners and at subway stations.",
      "Though there are few surprises and no debate, the weeklong National People\u2019s Congress does offer clues to China\u2019s priorities at home and how it plans to approach the world.",
      "Even as it faces a slowing economy, China appears to be making a strategic decision to present itself as a global stalwart amid a world in turmoil as Trump upends international trade and long-standing alliances, eroding U.S. prestige and creating an opportunity for China to fill the void.",
      "As if to underscore China\u2019s relative steadfastness,\u00a0Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi rarely gestured or moved his hands at his annual news conference on Friday.\u00a0He used the word \u201cstability\u201d at least 14 times during 90 minutes in front of reporters, according to Chinese transcripts.",
      "Some of his sharpest language was directed at the Trump administration, which last week doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and said there could be more to come.",
      "\u201cNo country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other,\u201d Wang said, slamming what he called a \u201ctwo-faced approach.\u201d",
      "China has long complained about U.S. tariffs, which in the first Trump administration set off a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But at least outwardly, China doesn\u2019t appear overly concerned about the impact of the new tariffs or in a rush to placate Trump to stave off more.",
      "\u201cNobody worries about it,\u201d tech executive Yao Lijun told NBC News on Wednesday as he walked out of the Great Hall of the People, an ornate building next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing where some 3,000 Chinese leaders and lawmakers were gathered for the NPC.",
      "\u201cWe only focus on ourselves, how we can do much better,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t worry about others.\u201d",
      "China responded to the new tariff on Tuesday by announcing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, mostly agricultural products, in a measured move similar to the levies it imposed when the first 10% tariff took effect last month.",
      "\u201cAppearing alarmed or alarmist is not something Beijing wants to communicate, because that\u2019s precisely what Trump is trying to elicit,\u201d said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai.",
      "Though Wang avoided saying anything too provocative on Friday, earlier in the week Beijing called back to its more aggressive \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy of the past, with the Foreign Ministry saying, \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "It was the harshest rhetoric from Beijing since Trump returned to office in January.",
      "The message from those comments is clear, said Wang Dong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University in Beijing. China will resolutely defend its national interests, and any U.S. attempt to force it into submission \u201cwill backfire and fail,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina will use a \u2018tit for tat\u2019 strategy, meaning if the U.S. shifts to conflict, China will follow suit and retaliate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the U.S. reverts back to cooperation, China will do the same.\u201d",
      "Cooperation did not appear to be on Trump\u2019s mind on Tuesday as he told Congress he would impose reciprocal tariffs on \u201cfriend and foe\u201d starting April 2.",
      "His \u201cAmerica First\u201d speech sent the message that \u201cthe U.S. only cares about its own interests and will pursue them in a relentless and ruthless manner, without caring about international rules or norms,\u201d Wang, the professor, said in written comments.",
      "He noted that Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which he touted in his address to Congress. Such moves signal the U.S. is no longer interested in upholding the liberal values and rules-based international order it has championed since the end of World War II, Prof. Wang said.",
      "\u201cBy contrast, China\u2019s message is it is willing to work with other stakeholders and the international community to tackle common global challenges such as climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "In keeping with the stability theme, Chinese officials announced the same target for economic growth as last year: 5%. Likewise, China\u2019s 2025 increase in defense spending is staying the same as last year at 7.2%.",
      "Delivering a government work report at the opening session on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, did not mention Trump but noted rising unilateralism and protectionism around the world and indicated China would pursue the opposite.",
      "\u201cChina is ready to work with other members of the international community to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world,\u201d he said.",
      "Li acknowledged China\u2019s significant economic challenges, which include a persistent property crisis, high youth unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. And in a nod to U.S. tariffs and other measures, he said, \u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science and technology.\u201d",
      "\u201cRegardless of changes in the external environment, we should remain steadfast in our commitment to opening up,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe will continue to expand our globally oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.\u201d",
      "China is counting on its trade relationships with other countries to help its export-dependent economy withstand Trump\u2019s tariffs, the cost of which U.S. and other experts say will be almost entirely passed on to American consumers and importers.",
      "\u201cTo be frank, with this kind of tariff war, both countries suffer,\u201d said Zhang Weiwei, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and the director of its China Institute.",
      "\u201cBut the U.S. will suffer more.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing and Jennifer Jett and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

One sailor from the Solong is missing and presumed dead. The other 36 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore, with no major injuries.",
      "The Solong was drifting and still on fire Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said.",
      "The 596-foot Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government\u2019s Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed.",
      "The collision sent jet fuel pouring into the sea and raised fears of significant environmental damage. Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins, and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs."

    "story": [
      "ROME \u2014 The recovery of Pope Francis from double pneumonia continued Wednesday as he inched toward notching some important milestones in his papacy: the 12th anniversary Thursday of his election as pope and a near-record in hospital stays for a pontiff.",
      "The Vatican said Wednesday that Francis had a quiet night at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital.",
      "If the last few days are any guide, the 88-year-old Argentine will most likely follow the Vatican\u2019s spiritual retreat remotely while his physical and respiratory therapy continues. The pope\u2019s weekly Wednesday general audience was canceled anyway, since the entire Vatican hierarchy is on retreat this week as part of the Lenten spiritual exercises that have been a mainstay of the Jesuit pope\u2019s pontificate.",
      "Doctors have said Francis is making slow, gradual improvements and this week declared that he\u2019s no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of the complex respiratory infection he had when he was admitted on Feb. 14. But they remain cautious, given the complexity of his condition and overall fragility, and say he needs to remain hospitalized for an unspecified number of days.",
      "Another medical update was expected later Wednesday.",
      "Thursday marks the 12th anniversary of Francis\u2019 election as the 266th pope. The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave that was called after Pope Benedict XVI resigned. While Francis has praised Benedict\u2019s humility in stepping down and said that he too might follow in his footsteps, more recently he has said that the papacy is a job for life.",
      "The Holy See hasn\u2019t said how the anniversary, which is a public holiday in the Vatican, might be commemorated this year.",
      "Another milestone comes Friday, when Francis marks four weeks or 28 days of hospitalization. St. John Paul II has the record for a hospital stay, at 55 days in 1981 when he underwent a minor surgical operation and was then treated for a cytomegalovirus infection. Francis is on track to equal the second-longest stay, 28 days, which John Paul recorded in 1994 when he had surgery to repair his right hip joint after he fractured his right femur in a fall, according to Gemelli hospital.",
      "The Vatican has released no photos or video of Francis since he was admitted. The pope recorded an audio message last week to thank people for their prayers, though the weakness and breathlessness of his voice made clear just how frail he was."

      "\u201cAir quality data saves lives,\u201d Hammes said. \u201cIt creates much needed awareness, informs policy decisions, guiding public health interventions, and empowers communities to take action to reduce air pollution and protect future generations.\u201d",
      "Last week, U.S. embassies and consulates said they had stopped monitoring\u00a0air quality\u00a0abroad, ending a program that had provided essential public health data for more than a decade.",
      "Data the United States provided in dozens of countries had led to noticeable improvements in local air quality in China and elsewhere, reducing premature deaths and generating cost savings associated with lower mortality, studies found.",
      "Air pollution accounted for 8.1 million deaths worldwide in 2021, according to the WHO.\u00a0Children under age 5 are considered especially vulnerable, with health effects including premature birth, low birth weight, asthma and lung disease."

    "summary": "With President Donald Trump setting his sights on acquiring Greenland, voters in the general election were thinking about the future status of the Arctic island.",
    "story": [
      "With President Donald Trump aggressively setting his sights on acquiring Greenland and growing calls in the territory for independence from Denmark, the future status of the Arctic island was firmly at the front of voters' minds as they headed to the polls Tuesday.",
      "Just 31 lawmakers will be elected to Greenland\u2019s parliament or Inatsisartut, but the vote, which has drawn little attention in previous years, will be watched the world over.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a different election this time around,\u201d said Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, which provides training, research and advice to Denmark\u2019s military.",
      "Politicians in Greenland had previously talked about independence from Denmark as \u201ca goal for future generations,\u201d he told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s interest has made it really tangible\u201d because voters can see what independence looks like, he said. This could be close collaboration or \u201cperhaps even annexation by the U.S.\u201d and could happen in a few years, he added.",
      "While Greenland is the world\u2019s largest island, it is also one of the most sparsely populated, home to just more than 56,000 people.",
      "Controlled by Denmark for almost 300 years, it became a formal territory of the country in 1953 before gaining home rule in 1979, though Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy. It also contributes just under $1 billion to Greenland's economy.",
      "Denmark has nonetheless benefited from the arrangement too, according to Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative, a London-based think tank. Menezes  said it had \u201cprofited enormously from Greenland over the decades, not just in terms of significant economic gains, but also the geopolitical advantage it has enjoyed globally as a result.\u201d",
      "Still, Trump has repeatedly stated an interest in acquiring the island, which is technically part of North America and two-thirds of which sits above the rapidly melting Arctic Circle, where deposits of rare-earth minerals and potential offshore oil and natural gas remain largely untapped, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Having broached the issue in his first term and on multiple occasions after his return to the White House in January, in last week's lengthy speech to Congress, Trump said the United States would acquire Greenland, which is already home to an American military base, \u201cone way or the other.\u201d",
      "However, his overtures have been repeatedly rebuffed by both lawmakers in Greenland and Danish politicians.",
      "Greenlanders \u201cdeserve to be treated with respect, and I don\u2019t think the U.S. president has done that recently since he took office,\u201d Prime Minister Mute Egede told the Danish public broadcaster, DR, on Monday.",
      "Egede, whose Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party favors a gradual transition to autonomy, added that he thought Trump\u2019s actions meant \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to get as close to (the U.S.) as they might have wanted in the past.\u201d",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has also repeatedly ruled out transferring the territory to the U.S.",
      "Greenland's citizens also seemed less than enamored with the idea. A recent poll commissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and Greenlandic daily Sermitsiaq found that 85% of respondents did not wish to become a part of the U.S., with nearly half seeing Trump\u2019s interest as a threat.",
      "In a pre-emptive move to curb U.S. interference, Greenland\u2019s parliament last month passed a new law banning foreign contributions to political parties.",
      "However, some parties, like the left-wing Naleraq and the center-right Demokraatit party, have campaigned for a quick transition to full independence, along with a defense agreement with Washington that would see the island get U.S. support without becoming an American territory.",
      "Others, like the social democratic Siumut party, which has dominated the country\u2019s politics and previously shared power with Egede's IA, have previously called for an independence referendum before backtracking.",
      "Ahead of the results which are expected during the early hours of Wednesday, \u201cthe big question is whether they see this as staying status quo within the Kingdom of Denmark, or perhaps with slightly more autonomy, or the other option of having a very close relationship with the U.S.,\u201d said Rahbek-Clemmensen from the Royal Danish Defence College.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also very obvious that the choice has to be made right now,\u201d he added."

      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer giant Manchester United plans to say goodbye to its storied Old Trafford stadium and build a 100,000-seater stadium nearby as the team continues to struggle on the field.",
      "The Red Devils announced early Tuesday that Old Trafford, United's home since 1910 which holds 74,000 people, would be abandoned as part of a wider plan to regenerate the area.",
      "United said in a statement that the plan could create 92,000 new jobs and more than 17,000 homes and attract 1.8 million visitors a year.",
      "Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, said it would be \"the world\u2019s greatest football stadium.\"",
      "He added: \"Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport.\"",
      "Once an imposing cathedral of football, Old Trafford has been eclipsed in the 21st century by more modern stadiums across the country, including that of local rival Manchester City. It has been the source of criticism from visiting fans and journalists.",
      "An image of the plans from architects Foster + Partners depicts an unusual web-like structure covering the stadium, suspended by three tall pillars.",
      "Norman Foster, the company's founder, said it was an umbrella that would \"harvest energy and rainwater\" and cover a public plaza twice the size of London's Trafalgar Square.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Theater of Dreams\" by Bobby Charlton, one of United's most famous players, Old Trafford has been the home of long periods of dominance in English and European soccer, including a historic \"treble\" in 1999, in which stars including David Beckham and Peter Schmeichel lifted the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup trophies.",
      "The club is still one of the world's most recognizable, but those dreams have turned to nightmares for United in recent years is its fortunes have dwindled dramatically since the departure of Alex Ferguson, the team's most successful and longest-serving manager.",
      "The team is 14th in the Premier League Table after just nine wins in 28 games this season.",
      "Thousands of fans gathered outside Old Trafford on Saturday to protest against the club's ownership, the more than 1 billion pounds ($1.29 billion) of debt it holds and an increase in ticket prices.",
      "United still holds the record for the most top-flight league titles, with 20, although it may soon be forced to share the record with bitter rival Liverpool, which is behind United on 19 and is 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League table.",
      "Ferguson said in the news release: \"Old Trafford holds so many special memories for me personally, but we must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\""
