      "Brett Goldstein explores complex relationships in the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201d streaming on Apple TV+ Friday",
      "Brett Goldstein might want to break your heart. Or at least give you a proper ugly cry.",
      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

      "\u201cI was really conflicted, but I also felt great compassion for each of the characters,\u201d Poots said. \u201cAll a person is the choices they make or don\u2019t make, and I think that feelings and desire and love, these are completely out of your control. And I don\u2019t think you can vilify a person for sort of having them. It\u2019s just when they follow through it obviously complicates things.\u201d",
      "Part of the equation involved making sure that Laura\u2019s soulmate, and husband, wasn\u2019t easy to dismiss. Not only did they write him as kind, loving and a good father. They also cast a handsome Scottish actor, Steven Cree, to play him.",
      "\u201cOne thing we didn\u2019t want to do that I think romantic comedies do a lot is they make the other guy boring or a (expletive)-head. So you\u2019re going, \u2018Oh, obviously not him,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cYou have to kind of stack the odds against all of them because that is more real and it\u2019s much more challenging, I think, for an audience because I think you are going \u2018I want this thing to happen and I also don\u2019t want this thing to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d was a kind of unintentional touchstone in thinking about the idea of friendships between straight men and women that only became clear to them after they made the film. An even less intentional reference was \u201cAtonement.\u201d Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, they set a pivotal scene between Laura and Simon in the same cottage on the English Channel in East Sussex that Joe Wright used for his classic tearjerker.",
      "While movie fans might bemoan the lack of the Nora Ephron-style romantic comedies of the 1990s on our screens, modern movies are grappling with the state of relationships in serious, satirical and genre-skewing ways, with films like \u201cMaterialists,\u201d\u201cSplitsville,\u201d \u201cAll of You\u201d and more. The distinction, Bridges said, is perhaps audiences today are craving stories not about aspirational, unattainable romance, but about love \u2014 however complicated and messy it might be.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the movie where somebody runs to the train station at the end and confesses undying love and the movie ends and the idea is they live happily ever after. But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "The revolution will not be televised, but it will be placed at the front and center of Anderson\u2019s film. The director isn\u2019t there to make his audience comfortable, star Teyana Taylor says, as he zeros in on themes of immigration, racism and systemic corruption showcased at their most absurd.",
      "\u201cI feel like PTA calls out a lot of things that are trying to get swept under the rug,\u201d Taylor told The Associated Press, referring to the director by his nickname. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I respect. This is really waking, shaking and baking some s---. Like, you gotta shake the table.\u201d",

From the film\u2019s first scene, we see the French 75 take matters into their own hands, liberating undocumented detainees, destroying corrupt political offices and launching their own form of justice, one right after the other. The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",

      "DiCaprio portrays Bob Ferguson, known in the French 75\u2019s initial scenes as Ghetto Pat, known for his knowledge of explosives and undying devotion to both Perfidia and the revolution. Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is Anderson\u2019s most expensive project to date and shot entirely in VistaVision \u2014 a decades-old format that's been revived in recent years by movies like \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",

At a news conference in Orlando, the lawyers also took issue with a top Universal executive last weekend saying in a note to employees that \u201cinternal findings\u201d showed the ride worked as it should have.",

He also worked as an employment counselor for people with disabilities, helping them land jobs and then checking on them once they started working. His parents said they never treated him any differently than his sister and brother because of his disability.",

      "Lear deBessonet, the new artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, has chosen \u201cRagtime\u201d as her first show",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lear deBessonet, the incoming artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, was thinking about what should be her first show as its new leader, she landed on something sweeping, very American \u2014 and some unfinished business.",
      "She had just directed an off-Broadway concert version of \u201cRagtime\u201d \u2014 a big, soaring musical celebrating early 20th-century America \u2014 that had wowed critics despite being a bare-boned production with some actors reading from their scripts. Might it fit the bill if she filled it out?",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re hoping is to make work that\u2019s going to be meaningful in people\u2019s lives, and I really felt that it was. And that it was in a way that wasn\u2019t finished,\u201d the Tony Award-nominated director says. \u201cIt really warranted the full flourishing of the idea.\u201d",
      "She gets her wish this fall as 33 actors buoyed by an 28-piece orchestra announce her arrival with a full-throated Broadway revival of the stage version of E.L. Doctorow\u2019s bestselling novel. Previews begin Friday; opening night is Oct. 16.",
      "\u201cRagtime'' is the story of three distinct groups of characters navigating their way through the turbulent racial and economic times of 1906 in New York City \u2014 a Jewish immigrant with his young daughter, a well-to-do white family and a Black piano player.",
      "\u201cBecause \u2018Ragtime\u2019 has, in fact, so many stories with multiple protagonists, there is an opportunity for people to connect with it in many different ways that reflect their own history, their own family\u2019s history, their own experience,\u201d she says.",
      "Tony Award-nominee Joshua Henry leads the cast and views it as the perfect musical for this moment. \u201cHow we see each other, how we hear each other is right now at the forefront,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Ragtime\u2019 puts the spotlight on how we have been successful and not successful doing that in the past, and I feel that\u2019s going to help us move forward.\u201d",
      "The revival is part of a slate of shows that deBessonet is crafting for the multi-Tony Award-winning, three-theater complex on the Lincoln Center campus, one that has built a reputation for new plays and sumptuous revivals of great musicals.",
      "\u201cThe work we make here I want it to be something that anyone of any background \u2014 whether they are visiting New York City or were born here \u2014 could come in and feel restored to humanity, feel connected to other people,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of why I\u2019m such a passionate advocate for the theater as an art form is, I really believe, it\u2019s a place where we can gather across difference.\u201d",
      "DeBessonet this season is also bringing over the London hit \u201cKyoto,\u201d a political thriller about the climate accords, and a revival of \u201cThe Whoopi Monologues\u201d with Kerry Washington and Kara Young.

      "Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu are part of a new wave of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene",
      "HAVANA -- Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu seem shy at first, but the moment they step on stage, they become confident, filling a concert hall in downtown Havana with a hypnotic form of traditional jazz.",
      "The Abreu brothers, aged 19 and 17, are part of a new generation of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene. They are filling a void left by established performers who have emigrated or stayed abroad as the island endures one of its most dire economic crises in decades. Their rise is also fueled by the opening of small, private venues for their shows and the relatively recent spread of internet access on the island, which they use for promotion.",
      "\u201cWe do what we like and we\u2019re fortunate enough to make a living from what we love, which is music,\u201d 19-year-old Fabio Abreu said shortly before a concert at the F\u00e1brica de Arte Cubano, a sprawling cultural center housed in a former factory that now operates as an art gallery, music venue and nightclub.",
      "And it's not just good old traditional jazz like that of the Abreus. Young musicians in Cuba are experimenting with everything, mixing traditional Cuban music like timba and salsa with newer, more daring sounds like electronic music and hip hop.",
      "The Cuban music scene is both complex and interesting, said Michel Hern\u00e1ndez, a writer and journalist specialized in music. \u201cThe recent migration of major Cuban artists \u2014 many with established careers \u2014 has created a void that is now being filled by a new generation of musicians,\u201d he said.",
      "The emerging scene is highly hybrid, he said, blending rock, pop and electronic music with traditional Afro-Cuban music styles such as \u201cson,\u201d which is the root of salsa. The phenomenon has led to the rise of new genres, including the highly commercial \u201creparto,\" a genre that originated in Havana\u2019s working-class neighborhoods and is known for its explicit lyrics.",
      "In addition to new sounds, many of these artists are now performing in small, private bars that have opened over the last decade. And lacking a formal record industry, young Cuban artists rely heavily on social media and the internet \u2014 a tool only widely available on the island since late 2018. They also depend on music videos, some of which are made with very low production budgets, that are shared between phones.",
      "One of them is Melanie Santiler, a 23-year-old pop singer and songwriter who has gained a following among young people. She credits online videos for much of her success. Her Instagram account boasts 248,000 followers, while her YouTube channel has 73,000.",
      "\u201cWe emerging musicians are the ones carrying the flag and shaping the future of Cuban music,\" she said. \u201cFor me, this is a decisive moment.\u201d",

      "Scarlett Johansson makes her directorial debut with \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d starring June Squibb",
      "There is a lovely story of friendship, grief and starting over at the heart of \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film, directed by Scarlett Johansson in her feature debut, gets tangled in a plot contrivance that is, at best, unnecessary and at worst, loathsome.",
      "That\u2019s the problem with the elevator pitch mentality, though. A story about a 90-something trying to make friends in a new city might sound a little too simple, a little too straightforward. What if she does so by pretending to be a Holocaust survivor? I\u2019m not kidding.",
      "Eleanor is played by June Squibb (the great). At 94-years-old, she has moved from Florida to New York after the death of her best friend and roommate Bessie (Rita Zohar). Her daughter, Lisa (Jessica Hecht), and grandson, Max (Will Price), have taken her into their small Manhattan apartment, but they only seem interested in getting Eleanor into an assisted living arrangement. Lisa especially treats her mother's presence like an inconvenience, a problem to fix, and Eleanor starts looking elsewhere for companionship.",
      "The thing is Eleanor had a great life in Florida, living with her platonic best friend in a little apartment. The script, Tory Kamen\u2019s first produced screenplay, smartly introduces this idyllic moment first. It is a distinct joy to watch the two nonagenarians go about their daily activities, from velcroing their shoes to doing their exercises on the beach.",
      "Squibb recently had a version of this in the delightful \u201cThelma,\u201d but there she was alone, a widow determined to hold onto her independent living situation. Here, Bessie and Eleanor help each other, whether it\u2019s waking up on time, or standing up for the other at the local supermarket when their preferred brand of kosher pickles isn\u2019t on the shelf and the teenage employee dares to suggest that \u201call pickles taste the same.\u201d Then Bessie suddenly dies, and Eleanor is left with no choice but to start over.",
      "It\u2019s hard to make new friends anywhere, at any age, but perhaps even more so in drizzly, cold New York. When a friendly woman at the Jewish Community Center asks Eleanor if she\u2019s here for \u201cthe group,\u201d Eleanor doesn\u2019t question it. Yes, she says with a relieved smile. When it becomes clear that this group is for Holocaust survivors, she does try to leave, but everyone encourages her to stay and suddenly she\u2019s telling Bessie\u2019s story of losing her brother in Poland as her own. The script has already established Eleanor as a bit of a liar \u2014 but they\u2019re the small kinds, the white lies that, she says, aren\u2019t hurting anyone.",

      "Nina has recently lost her mother and finds solace in this relationship. It\u2019s here where you can start to see how the rest of the movie is going to play out, how the lie will go on too long and be exposed at a terrible time, leading to inevitable feelings of betrayal and humiliation. And it is very, very hard to watch Squibb in distress. Rather than celebrate the performance you want to lash out at the script that put her in this situation in the first place. That may not be fair but it\u2019s also true.",
      "The story becomes less of a character study of the strange ways in which grief manifests and more about the escalating hijinks of a lie that takes on a wild life of its own. Soon Eleanor is speaking to Nina\u2019s journalism peers in an on-the-record, taped conversation, telling another of Bessie\u2019s stories. Then, Nina\u2019s distant father ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ), a local news anchor, decides Eleanor\u2019s is a great human-interest story for his show.",
      "There is a thread about the merits of preserving memory, but it\u2019s introduced a little too late and too flimsily to justify all that came before it. Johansson directs the proceedings simply, like a classic New York character drama, allowing the performances to shine over the filmmaking, but who she is as a filmmaker remains to be seen. Squibb and Kellyman, both terrific, are the real reasons to seek out \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film may trip over its own contrivances but their performances will leave you moved.",
      "\u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome language, thematic elements and suggestive references.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",
      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",

      "\u201cAs a gay man myself, it\u2019s been really rewarding for me to be working on this role, thinking back to my coming out process 20 years ago now,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSammy wants to believe there\u2019s a future for him, but he keeps struggling and wondering if the world will ever get past its prejudice and accept him.\u201d",
      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2020, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists. When he\u2019s not on site he handles logistics remotely and also relies heavily on volunteers.",
      "\u201cJust being the person who with a lot of other people behind me brings art to this region which is rural and remote \u2026 It\u2019s been one of the big blessings of my life,\u201d he said.",
      "And when he isn\u2019t performing, he returns. \u201cI have a room in my parents\u2019 basement where I store my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m between contracts I come back here and stay with my mom and dad. \u2026 I\u2019lll call them from Amsterdam and say \u2018OK, what are we having for dinner next Tuesday when I land.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d runs through Oct. 11. Also starring are baritone Andrzej Filo\u0144czyk as Joe; soprano Lauren Snouffer as his sister, Sarah; soprano Sun-Ly Pierce as Rosa Saks, and baritone Edward Nelson as Tracy Bacon.

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

      "First, with clothes, \"use a lot of color. I call it our filter,\u201d Tincher said.",

If you have more silk satin, like say something like a blouse, it\u2019s going to be more like a laser beam,\u201d she said.",
      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin will stop scheduling patients for abortions starting next week as it works to find a way to provide the service in the face of Medicaid funding cuts in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, the nonprofit said Thursday.",
      "Abortion funding across the U.S. has been under siege, particularly Planned Parenthood affiliates, which are the biggest provider.",
      "The organization warned earlier this year that about half its clinics that provide abortion could be closed as a result of a ban on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for services other than abortion.",
      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",
      "Planned Parenthood services include cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.",
      "The remaining Planned Parenthood clinics in Louisiana \u2013 where abortion is banned \u2013 are scheduled to shut down at the end of this month.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it is trying to see as many patients as possible between now and Tuesday. The federal law takes effect Wednesday. It is not scheduling patients beyond that date and the organization believes the move will allow it to continue seeing other Medicaid patients. The organization said it was working with providers across the state to make sure patients are referred quickly and receive timely care.",
      "It is also considering taking legal action, the group said.",
      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion, as soon and as we are able to,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we are pursuing every available option through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.\u201d",
      "The abortion landscape has been shifting frequently since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed states to ban abortion. Currently, 12 states do not allow it at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four more ban it after about six weeks\u2019 gestation.",
      "The bans have resulted in more women traveling for abortion and an increased reliance on abortion pills. Prescribers in states where they\u2019re allowed have been shipping the pills to places where abortion is banned, a practice that is facing some legal challenges and is expected to attract more.",

The same day it ruled in that case, the court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin asking it to find the law unconstitutional.",
      "Wisconsin's abortion ban was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never officially repealed it, however, and conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that overturned Roe reactivated it.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin stopped providing abortions after that ruling for 15 months before resuming them as the lawsuit over the state law played out. It has been providing abortions at three clinics in Wisconsin for the past two years.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

      "\u201cUnlike the previous administration which chose to sue, obstruct, and delay, President Trump and his team have worked alongside us to improve Georgia Pathways and ultimately deliver a better program to Georgians who need it most,\" Kemp said in a statement.",
      "A federal watchdog reported earlier this month that Georgia spent $54.2 million in administrative spending and $26.2 million on health care from 2021 through the middle of 2025. The administrative portion declined more recently, from 96.5% in fiscal year 2023 to 58.8% in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to drop more in 2025.",
      "Nearly 90% of spending has been federal money, and Georgia used $20 million in other federal grants to help implement the program.",
      "Opponents, including Democratic U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, deride Pathways as festooned in red tape while funneling money to the private consulting firm that runs it. In a Thursday statement, Warnock said that \u201cthe only thing Pathways is incredibly effective at is barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer.\"",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision will continue to keep health care away from Georgians who need it most. It is wrong, it is immoral, and it only makes our country sicker and poorer,\u201d Warnock continued.",

      "The World Health Organization said Wednesday that 57 cases and 35 deaths have been reported since the outbreak was announced by Congolese authorities on Sept. 4. The fatality rate is over 61%.",
      "It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo characterized by its poor road networks. It is located more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the nation\u2019s capital of Kinshasa.",
      "\u201cWe urgently need our partners and donors to step up and support this lifesaving response to ensure we can contain the outbreak quickly and protect the most vulnerable communities,\u201d said Susan Nzisa Mbalu, head of communications for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa, IFRC.",
      "Earlier this week, the IFRC said it is appealing for 20 million Swiss francs ($25 million) to help contain the outbreak and aiming to reach 965,000 people with urgent assistance. It warned that health facilities are overwhelmed and lack the resources to provide care, with clean water and protective equipment running critically low.",
      "According to the IFRC, the only treatment centre in the Bulape health zone, where the epicenter of the outbreak has been declared and the majority of cases are concentrated, is already at 119% capacity.",
      "Health officials are particularly concerned about the impact of U.S. funding cuts, especially since the U.S. has a history of supporting Congo\u2019s past Ebola outbreaks, including a 2021 effort when the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.",
      "IFRC\u2019s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.",
      "Despite the absence of USAID, Mathias Mossoko, the Ebola Response Coordinator in Bulape, said that the U.S. government has provided \u201csome small support,\u201d though he could not provide specific details.",
      "WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told the AP on Thursday that the organization\u2019s only current funding for the outbreak response is a $2 million emergency fund and around $2.3 million from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Gavi vaccine alliance.",
      "That is far below the WHO\u2019s projected cost of around $20 million to respond to the outbreak over the next three months.",
      "\u201cWithout immediate support, gaps in operations will persist, jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities,\u201d Jasarevic said.",
      "The Congolese authorities\u2019 current national response plan is estimated at $78 million.",

      "While the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change and other crises got much of the focus in the U.N.'s marathon week of speeches and meetings, the topic of drugs turned up from Trump's and Petro's tough talk to side events on such themes as gender-inclusive drug policy and international cooperation to fight organized crime.",

The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care. Greenland took over its own health care programs in 1992.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional data for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.",

The 2024 increases was not as steep as in other years \u2014 cases were up by less than 2% from 2023. But health experts say no cases should be happening, and any growth is worrisome.",

      "About 1.5 million chlamydia cases, 543,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 190,000 of syphilis were diagnosed and reported last year. Each was lower than the year before, and the more than 2.2 million total cases represented a 9% decline from 2023.",

Cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the disease's most infectious stages, fell 22% last year, the CDC says.",
      "The new data suggests that the improvement in some groups has not yet played out in obstetrics wards. There are several possible factors, but one could be that only 80% of pregnant women are getting screened for syphilis, according to a recent CDC study.",

      "The criticism targets a plan from the Ministry of Energy and Mines in August to auction the rights for 49 oil and gas projects worth more than $47 billion.",
      "Officials say the \u201chydrocarbon roadmap\u201d is a strategy to modernize Ecuador\u2019s oil industry, attract foreign capital and boost production. Their plan includes contract renegotiations and new licensing rounds that the government says comply with existing legal frameworks.",
      "Indigenous groups say 18 of the proposed oil blocks overlap their territories \u2014 an area roughly the size of Belgium.",
      "Leaders from the Andwa, Shuar, Achuar, Kichwa, Sapara, Shiwiar and Waorani peoples say their communities were not consulted and accuse the government of ignoring court rulings that struck down earlier consultations as unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cThe government is pushing ahead with plans to auction 18 oil blocks in our ancestral territories without free, prior and informed consent. That is a constitutional and international right the state is violating,\u201d said Nemo Guiquita, a Waorani leader with the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

That could include the use of a firing squad, a method that's been used to execute South Carolina inmates twice this year.",

      "For example, under the DMA, the live translation feature that Apple unveiled earlier this month for use with AirPods would also have to work with wireless earbuds from other brands. The feature uses an iPhone's on-device AI to translate when other languages are spoken around the person using them. Apple says it needs more work to make sure conversations, which are processed on the device, stay private if used with non-Apple products.",

      "A Paris court found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty on a key charge but acquitted him on three others Thursday in his trial for the alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign with money from the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "The court is still detailing its ruling and hasn\u2019t immediately sentenced the 70-year-old Sarkozy. That step would come later in the court proceedings Thursday. Sarkozy can appeal the guilty verdict, which would suspend any sentence pending the appeal.",
      "The court found Sarkozy guilty of criminal association in a plot from 2005 to 2007 to finance his campaign with funds from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors. But it cleared him of three other charges -- including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealment of the embezzlement of public funds.",
      "Still, criminal association is a serious charge, carrying a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.",
      "The court also found two of Sarkozy\u2019s closest associates when he was president -- former ministers Claude Gu\u00e9ant and Brice Hortefeux \u2014 guilty of criminal association but likewise acquitted them of some other charges.",
      "Overall, the ruling suggested that the court believed that the men conspired to seek Libyan funding for Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign but that judges weren\u2019t convinced that the conservative leader himself was directly involved in the funding effort or that any Libyan money ended up being used in his winning campaign.",
      "The chief judge, in an hours-long reading of the lengthy verdict, said Sarkozy allowed his close associates to reach out to Libyan authorities \u201cto obtain or try to obtain financial support in Libya for the purpose of securing campaign financing.\u201d",
      "But the court also said it couldn\u2019t determine with certainty that Libyan money ended up financing Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Still, under French law, a corrupt scheme can still be a crime even if money wasn\u2019t paid or cannot be proven, the court explained.",
      "Sarkozy, accompanied by his wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was present in the courtroom, which was also filled with reporters and members of the public. Sarkozy sat in the front row of the defendant\u2019s seats. His three adult sons were also in the room.",
      "Sarkozy, who was elected in 2007 but lost his bid for reelection in 2012, denied all wrongdoing during a three-month trial earlier this year that also involved 11 co-defendants, including three former ministers.",
      "Despite multiple legal scandals that have clouded his presidential legacy, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in right-wing politics in France and in entertainment circles, by virtue of his marriage to Bruni-Sarkozy.",
      "The accusations trace their roots to 2011, when a Libyan news agency and Gadhafi himself said the Libyan state had secretly funneled millions of euros into Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign.",
      "In 2012, the French investigative outlet Mediapart published what it said was a Libyan intelligence memo referencing a 50 million-euro funding agreement. Sarkozy denounced the document as a forgery and sued for defamation. The court ruled Thursday that it \u201cnow appears most likely that this document is a forgery.\"",

      "At the same time, Russian tactics have switched since the start of the summer from costly large-scale offensives to deploying small assault groups in a new approach that Syrskyi called the \u201cthousand cuts\u201d tactic.",
      "His version of events could not be independently verified, and Russian officials made no immediate comment.",
      "Russian forces have been trying to engulf Ukraine with sheer weight of numbers and relentless barrages of drones, missiles, artillery and devastating glide bombs.

      "Syrskyi said Russia is launching large numbers of small assault groups of about four to six soldiers who use the cover of the terrain to penetrate the front line and then strike Ukrainian rear areas, disrupting supply lines and troop rotations. However, those small groups become cut off and are trapped by encircling Ukrainian forces, he said in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The iconic, brightly painted coastal sheds in and around Melbourne, Australia, are a quirky real estate mix: absolute beachfront views, but lacking basic features including a bedroom, bathroom, running water and even power.",
      "While they lack homely comforts, some can sell for more than an average Melbourne suburban house. And while the house comes with the security of land title, the shed is built on a public beach.",
      "Known variously as beach boxes, bathing boxes and boatsheds, these basic structures have been features of the Victoria state coastline along Port Phillip Bay and Western Port since the 19th century.",
      "What they have going for them these days as a financial investment is scarcity. Some real estate agents say boxes in the right location can be expected to double in value every seven to 10 years.",
      "John Rundell doesn\u2019t regard his bathing box on Dendy Street Beach in the upscale Melbourne suburb of Brighton as an investment.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of calling it an investment if you don\u2019t want to sell it?\u201d Rundell said.",
      "\u201cI suppose the market price is the market price. It does encourage people that are not using them now to sell them. But they don\u2019t turn over very often because they tend to stay within families through generations,\u201d he added.",
      "The prices and the rules surroundings beach boxes differ depending on where they are. A buyer needs to own a home in the area. And the sheds can\u2019t be rented out or put to any commercial use. No overnight camping is allowed. Solar cells and motorized electricity generators are banned.",
      "Rundell had a young family when he bought Bathing Box No. 43 \u2014 one among 96 arranged side by side along the beach \u2014 for 12,000 Australian dollars ($8,000) from the local council in 1992. The council and a local historical society defeated a state government plan in the 1970s to demolish them.",
      "He continues to pay an annual license fee plus rates on the box, which he considers to be the council double-dipping on income from a single address. He also must pay for public liability insurance cover for the box to the value of AU$20 million ($13 million).",
      "The boxes are useful spaces to keep beach toys, kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, BBQs and beach furniture.",
      "Rundell\u2019s family has shared Christmas lunches at their box and watched New Year\u2019s fireworks displays during Southern Hemisphere summers.",
      "There\u2019s no electricity, but there is an ice chest to keep drinks cold. There is no plumbing, but there's a camping potty with indoor privacy.",
      "With Rundell\u2019s children grown up and his granddaughter too young for the beach, the box is mostly used these days by friends who borrow the keys.",

      "The boxes were to preserve a bather\u2019s modesty when the law prohibited changing clothes on a beach and walking the streets in a swimsuit, local historian Jo Jenkinson wrote in her 2015 book, \u201cThe Lure of the Beach: A History of Public Sea Bathing in Brighton.\u201d",
      "Similar beach structures with similar origins still survive in other parts of the world.",

      "All the sheds have been removed from Australia\u2019s coastline over the decades except for around 2,000 in Melbourne\u2019s vicinity.",
      "The most expensive can be found in the wealthy tourist town of Portsea, a 90-minute drive from Melbourne. Portsea boxes often sell for AU$1 million ($660,000). A record AU$1.2 million ($800,000) was set last year.",

      "Corradi said there were other boxes, which he calls boatsheds, at Mount Martha with covered decks that would sell for more. Owners can\u2019t add covered decks because a shed\u2019s design and dimensions can\u2019t be altered.",

      "Intrusions into NATO\u2019s airspace blamed on Russia reached an unprecedented scale this month, raising questions about whether the Kremlin is trying to test the alliance\u2019s willingness and ability to respond to a direct attack or divert its attention and resources from the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia has been encroaching on its NATO neighbors' airspace for decades, then either denying it happened or brushing it off as unintentional. But since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, such incursions have carried a bigger threat, none more so than when drones swarmed into Poland two weeks ago and caused NATO to scramble jets to shoot them down.",
      "Estonia said Russian fighter jets flew into its territory last week and remained there for 12 minutes \u2014 an incursion Estonia\u2019s foreign minister described as \u201cunprecedently brazen\u201d but that Russia denied happened. And Romania and Latvia reported that single Russian drones violated their airspace this month.",
      "With Moscow making slow but steady progress on the battlefield in Ukraine and holding a strong hand should it decide to talk peace, its recent forays into NATO airspace also raise questions about why it would risk triggering a direct military confrontation with the alliance.",
      "Here's a look at what's been happening and what Russia's motives might be:",
      "None of the intrusions of NATO airspace has had the scope of what happened in Poland on Sept. 10, when authorities say about 20 Russian drones flew deep over the countryside before being shot down by NATO jets or crashing on their own. It marked the first direct military engagement between the alliance and Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russia denied that it targeted Poland, and its ally Belarus claimed the drones' signals had been jammed by Ukraine, which borders Poland. But European leaders have cast it as a deliberate provocation, pointing to last week's violation of Estonian airspace and other recent incidents as further proof of some broader scheme orchestrated by Moscow.",
      "Before invading Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin demanded that NATO drop any plans to offer Kyiv membership in the alliance and roll back troop deployments near Russia's borders, including in the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, small former Soviet republics that joined NATO and the EU in the early 2000s. NATO rejected the demands.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin also warned NATO to not allow Kyiv to strike deep inside Russia with Western-supplied longer-range weapons, threatening that Moscow could respond by targeting military facilities in NATO countries that enable such attacks. Doing so would carry huge risks, including for Moscow, as it could spark a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, which has a huge edge in conventional weapons.",
      "Some experts view the recent uptick in NATO airspace incursions as an attempt by Russia to see how the alliance reacts so that it can exploit any fissures or indecision. And some believe Russia is hoping to divert NATO\u2019s attention and resources from supporting Ukraine to defending its own territory.",
      "\u201cMaybe their calculation was that now the European countries have to send something additionally to Estonia regarding the air defense assets, and that means they cannot send it to Ukraine,\u201d Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. \u201cRussia is trying to tear us out from Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Mark Galeotti, an expert in Russian politics who heads the Mayak Intelligence consultancy, thinks the intrusions are part of a \u201ccoercive signaling\u201d aimed at discouraging NATO members from offering robust security guarantees to Kyiv, including the possible deployment of their troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. Moscow has warned that it won't accept any NATO troops in Ukraine.",

      "Edward Lucas, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said Russia might be trying to highlight NATO\u2019s weaknesses to try to \u201cplant the corrosive question in allies\u2019 minds: Are you willing to go to war with Russia on behalf of the Baltic states?\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia does not need to defeat NATO militarily if it can defeat it politically,\u201d Lucas wrote in an analysis. \u201cIf alliance members do not believe that other members will come to their aid when they are attacked, they feel isolated.\u201d",
      "Russia specifically might have wanted to gauge the reaction of NATO's biggest member, the U.S., said Max Bergmann, head of Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\u201cI think it was quite underwhelming,\u201d he said of the U.S.'s response to the incursions. \u201cI think what we are seeing is the United States under President Trump doesn\u2019t feel responsible for European security, and that will be quite enlightening to the Russians. They may escalate even more.\u201d",
      "After its drone swarm incident, Poland triggered a NATO mechanism that allows any member to demand a full meeting if it believes its territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened.

He demurred, though, when prodded if the U.S. would step in to back the alliance in such case.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Typhoon Ragasa weakened into a tropical depression early Thursday as it entered northeastern Vietnam, but it is still expected to bring heavy rains across the country's northern provinces.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the typhoon's sustained winds had weakened to a maximum 55 kph (34 mph) and Ragasa was forecast to dissipate eventually while remaining a rain threat for Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia.",
      "Officials in Vietnam warned of possible flash floods, landslides and flooding in low-lying areas.",
      "Vietnam\u2019s Prime Minister Ph\u1ea1m Minh Ch\u00ednh ordered government ministries and local authorities to protect infrastructure like dams and hospitals, secure fishing vessels and coastal assets, and ready evacuation and search and rescue operations. Some flights were canceled or rescheduled, and workers trimmed trees to avoid wind hazards in northern parts of the country.",
      "The Southeast Asian country is also bracing for another storm, which is currently approaching the Philippines from the Pacific. The storm Bualoi, which was named Opong in the Philippines, was forecast to hit eastern and central Philippines on Friday. It had sustained winds of up to 110 kph (68 mph) and higher gusts, government forecasters said.",
      "Vietnam expects it to intensify afterward and officials said it could make landfall near central Vietnam or veer toward the northeast coast.",
      "Ragasa entered Vietnam after flooding streets and homes in the economic hub of Guangdong province and causing deaths in Taiwan and the Philippines earlier in the week.",
      "It quickly weakened Thursday because dry, cold air from the north and its contact with land in China cut off the warm, moist air from the sea that fuels such storms.",
      "In the Guangdong city of Yangjiang, over 10,000 trees were damaged and branches floated in submerged streets. Crews used excavators to clear toppled trees and worked to clear blocked roads, Yangjiang Daily reported.",

      "In Taiwan, authorities on Thursday revised the death toll from 17 to 14, citing double-counting. The victims were in eastern Hualien County, where heavy rain caused a barrier lake to overflow, sending water gushing into nearby Guangfu township. Muddy torrents destroyed a bridge, turning the roads in the township into churning rivers that carried vehicles and furniture away. Some people remained out of contact in Hualien, and dozens were injured across the island.",

      "Lologa, 50, had been granted name suppression throughout the five-week trial, but the order was lifted when he was convicted.",
      "Prosecutors accepted Lologa had schizophrenia when he twice set fires inside the 92-bed hostel over one night in May 2023. They said he lit the fatal blaze not because of his mental illness but because he wanted to seek a transfer to other accommodation.",
      "Lologa's lawyers didn't deny that their client lit the fires, but they said he was not guilty by reason of insanity. In New Zealand, this meant the jury must accept the defendant was incapable of understanding that his actions were wrong.",
      "His lawyers said there was no evidence that he'd set the fires because he wanted to live elsewhere, but prosecutors said Lologa had told people he didn't like living at the boarding house, which was called Loafers Lodge, and wanted to move elsewhere.",
      "Lologa first set a couch in a communal area ablaze late one evening, prompting an evacuation of the building. After residents put out the fire, he returned and placed cushions and a blanket in a cupboard before setting them alight.",
      "He left the building without raising the alarm or calling emergency services. During the trial, the court heard recordings of desperate phone calls to the fire department from people trapped inside and accounts from tenants, including one man who jumped from a window to escape the blaze.",
      "In a police interview played for the jury, the man denied setting the fires, despite officers telling him he had been seen on security camera footage doing so, RNZ reported.",
      "Some of the boarding house residents included social services clients and older, disabled and otherwise vulnerable people, as well as nurses working at a nearby hospital. The burned-out building remains standing in the district of Newtown, near the central city of New Zealand\u2019s capital.",
      "The residents who died included colorful and well-known Wellington identities. Michael Wahrlich was a veteran busker who juggled tennis balls and Liam Hockings\u2019 daily foot tours of the area made him a familiar face to locals. The other three victims were Kenneth Barnard, Peter O\u2019Sullivan and Melvin Parun.",

      "Pork-derived gelatin is widely used as a stabilizer to ensure vaccines remain safe and effective during storage and transport, presenting a dilemma to religious communities that view pigs as ritually unclean. Many Islamic scholars say that vaccines with gelatin stabilizers can be used under religious law, as can other medical products with pig-derived ingredients, under certain conditions.",
      "Indonesian religious leaders ruled in 2018 that vaccines with pig gelatin are haram, or forbidden, but advised Muslims that they should be used until other shots are available \u201cfor the benefit of society,\u201d said Ahmad Syamsuri, the head of Disease Control and Prevention at the Sumenep Health Office.",
      "In Sumenep, many are reluctant to even discuss their religious concerns.",
      "Pujiati Wahyuni, a 31-year-old Muslim mother and nurse, knows parents who refuse the vaccines for their children on religious grounds, though she recently had her daughter receive the vaccine at an Islamic kindergarten in Pamolokan village.",
      "\u201cYes, there are some. Islam is a big religion. Maybe some Muslim people just do not want to get vaccinated, and it is not just now, but since they were born,\u201d Wahyuni said.",
      "The regional government\u2019s latest efforts began in August and include making more than 78,000 vaccines available to children in the region, which are distributed through local clinics, delivered directly to the residents at their homes and even brought to schools.",
      "The hope is that the campaign will help prevent future outbreaks, infections and deaths. But they cannot compel reluctant parents, said Musthafa, the general secretary of Indonesian Ulema Council in Sumenep.",
      "\u201cWe have high hopes for Muslims in Indonesia, who are the ones consuming it. Let us ask the government, in this case the Health Office and the Ministry of Health, to find a halal vaccine,\u201d said Musthafa.",
      "Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, has reported previous outbreaks of measles, mostly driven by gaps in vaccination coverage.",
      "In 2018, a major outbreak of the highly infectious disease occurred in the easternmost province of Papua, causing dozens of deaths. Due to some vaccine hesitancy then, the Indonesian Ulema Council said the measles-rubella vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India, contained an ingredient derived from pigs but allowed its use until a halal alternative was available.",

      "Analysis from the Royal United Services Institute in London says Russia is selling military equipment and technology to China that could help Beijing prepare for an airborne takeover of Taiwan",
      "LONDON -- Russia is selling military equipment and technology to China that could help Beijing prepare for an airborne invasion of Taiwan, according to an analysis of leaked Russian documents by a London think tank.",
      "The authors of the analysis at the Royal United Services Institute in London obtained around 800 pages of documents, including contracts and lists of equipment to be supplied by Moscow to Beijing, from the Black Moon hacktivist group.",
      "The group, which previously published some of the documents online, does not identify its members but describes itself in a manifesto as opposed to governments that carry out aggressive foreign policy. The authors of the RUSI report shared some of the documents with The Associated Press and say they appear to be genuine, although parts of the documents may have been omitted or altered. AP is unable to independently verify their authenticity.",
      "The mix of completed and apparent draft Russian documents reference meetings between Chinese and Russian delegations \u2014 including visits to Moscow \u2014 and payment and delivery timelines for high-altitude parachute systems and amphibious assault vehicles. They suggest that Russia has begun work on the products to be delivered but don\u2019t contain direct evidence from the Chinese side that Beijing has paid any money or received any equipment.",
      "While the authors argue the equipment could be used to invade Taiwan, under Xi Jinping China has embarked upon a broad modernization program of its armed forces with the goal of transforming it into a \u201cworld-class\u201d military by 2050.",
      "High ranking U.S. officials have suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered his military to be prepared for a possible invasion of Taiwan as early as 2027. Beijing claims the self-governing democracy is rightfully a part of China and has not ruled out seizing the island by force.",
      "The documents don't mention Taiwan directly, but the RUSI analysis suggests the deal would help China gain advanced parachuting capabilities that it would need to mount an invasion, potentially speeding up a timeline.",
      "It\u2019s not certain that China has decided to invade Taiwan, but access to Russian equipment and localized training in China means Beijing will be better equipped for a potential invasion, Danylyuk said.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese school of airborne landing is very young,\u201d he said, suggesting Moscow\u2019s assistance could help speed up China\u2019s airborne program by about 10 to 15 years.",
      "Russia's Kremlin, and China and Taiwan\u2019s defense and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThe greatest value of the deal\u201d to China is likely in the training and procedures for command and control of parachute forces, because Russia has \"combat experience,\u201d whereas China doesn't, write Oleksandr Danylyuk and Jack Watling.",
      "The analysts say Russia\u2019s aim is to develop as a military supplier to China and fund its war in Ukraine. But Danylyuk also suggested to AP that Moscow may want to draw Beijing into a conflict with Washington over Taiwan, distracting the U.S. from Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "While Beijing\u2019s military capabilities largely surpass Moscow\u2019s, the analysis says China has gaps which Russia can fill. Russia has a long history of airborne forces dating back decades, knowhow the authors say China needs.",
      "Song Zhongping, a military commentator in Beijing, said China had superior equipment, but \u201cRussia has more combat experience.\"",
      "\u201cRussia and China have their own relative strengths in paratrooping,\u201d Song said. They \"conducted joint air, sea patrols and drills, which indicates they are learning from each other\u2019s strengths to address their own weaknesses.\"",
      "According to a document dated September 2024, an initial agreement was reached in April 2021 with timelines for payments and delivery. Stages one and two \u2014 analysis of technical specifications, software modifications and equipment manufacturing \u2014 have been completed, according to that document.",
      "Russia also agreed to provide training in China and a complete set of equipment for an airborne battalion including the ability to carry out infiltration by special forces, the analysis says.",

      "Russia agreed to sell China systems which are designed for parachuting up to 190 kilograms (419 pounds) from an extremely high altitude, the RUSI analysis said.",
      "The documents reference the minutes of a meeting from March 8, 2024 in Moscow where Russia agreed to provide China by the end of 2024 with details of how the system, known as Dalnolyot, performed under colder temperature conditions: from \u201340 degrees Celsius (\u201340 Fahrenheit) to \u201360 degrees Celsius (\u201376 Fahrenheit.)",
      "According to the documents, Beijing requested testing the parachute systems for drops from 8,000 meters (26,250 feet).",
      "That height would allow Chinese forces to glide for up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) allowing \u201cChinese special forces groups to penetrate the territory of other countries without being noticed,\u201d the RUSI report said.",

      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Moscow is unable to sell equipment to China, Danylyuk said.",
      "The airborne equipment described in the documents was necessary only for \u201cthe invasion stage,\u201d he said. Russia is fighting a \u201ccompletely different war right now,\u201d and doesn't need such equipment for Ukraine, he said.",
      "In an invasion of Taiwan, China's \u201coperational challenge\u201d would be to do what Russia did not: suppress Taiwan\u2019s air defenses and land sufficient troops and equipment to be able to build up a force to defeat the Taiwanese military before it mobilizes, the analysts wrote.",
      "The report suggests China could do that by airdropping armored vehicles on golf courses near Taiwanese ports and airfields which could allow air troops to clear a path for landing forces.",

      "Helene killed more than 250 people and caused nearly $80 billion in damage from Florida to the Carolinas.

      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of former Federal Reserve chairs, Treasury secretaries, and top White House economists urged the Supreme Court Thursday to reject an attempt by President Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.",
      "In a filing with the court, the former officials argued that allowing the removal to proceed would undermine the Fed's longtime independence from day-to-day politics and lead to higher inflation and a weaker economy.",
      "The filing from such an influential group underscores the unpredecented nature of Trump's effort to remove Cook and the potentially far-reaching consequences for the economy if he were to succeed.",
      "\u201cThere is broad consensus among economists, based on decades of macroeconomic research, that a more independent central bank will lead to lower and more stable inflation without creating higher unemployment,\u201d the brief, signed by 18 top economists from both political parties, said. \u201cIndependent central banks also help increase confidence in the stability of the U.S. dollar, enabling the United States, businesses, and households to borrow at lower interest rates.\u201d",
      "Former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan signed onto the filing. Former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson, Lawrence Summers, Robert Rubin, Timothy Geithner, and Jacob Lew also signed. Paulson served in the George W. Bush administration while Rubin and Summers served in Bill Clinton's administration. Geithner and Lew served in President Barack Obama's White House.",
      "Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook last month after members of the administration accused her of mortgage fraud, the first time a president has tried to remove a Federal Reserve governor in the institution's 112-year history. Cook has denied the accusations and some documents have surfaced that appear to undercut the fraud claims.",
      "Cook sued to keep her job and two federal courts have ruled that she can stay in her position while her case is considered by the courts.",
      "Federal Reserve officials aren't like cabinet secretaries and don't serve at the pleasure of the president. Instead, they can only be fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d which has traditionally meant some kind of malfeasance or neglect on the job. At issue in the legal fight is whether the mortgage fraud allegations are sufficient cause for her to be removed. Governors vote on the Fed's interest-rate policies as well as oversee banking regulation.",
      "Bernanke and the other former officials argued in their filing that the perception of Fed independence is crucial for the central bank, because it can fight inflation much more effectively if businesses and workers \u2014 whom the filing refers to as \u201cprice-setters\u201d \u2014 believe the Fed will fight to keep inflation at its 2% target.",

The Fed typically seeks to combat inflation by raising its short-term interest rate to cool borrowing and spending.",
      "But if political pressure forces the Fed to shift its focus away from inflation and instead lower its key interest rate to provide a short-term boost to the economy, \u201cthe price-setters will not believe a future Fed announcement of a commitment to low-inflation policies and will therefore not structure their own economic decisions around the expectation of low inflation,\" the brief said. \u201cInstead, price-setters will expect inflation to go up and act accordingly, leading to a vicious cycle of high inflation and low employment.\u201d",
      "\u201cCentral bank independence is the solution that Congress and the President have chosen, effectively tying their hands, like Ulysses as he passed the sirens, to protect against the risk that monetary policy will be mishandled,\u201d they added.",
      "Former officials from both parties also signed onto the brief, including Phil Gramm, a former Republican senator from Texas, as well as Jason Furman, who was a top economic adviser to Obama; Glenn Hubbard and Gregory Mankiw, economic advisers to George W. Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund; and Cecilia Rouse, a top adviser to former president Joe Biden.",
      "John Cochrane, a frequent Fed critic and a senior fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution signed onto the brief, as did Jared Bernstein, an adviser to Biden.",

      "From coastal grandma to clean girl aesthetic, microtrends are everywhere on social media, and you're often encouraged to spend money to participate",
      "NEW YORK -- Did you buy a new pink dress to watch the Barbie movie, only to never wear it again? An Oura ring because your favorite TikTok influencer had it? A new pair of baggy jeans because '90s fashion is making a comeback?",
      "Niche trends fueled by social media can influence your shopping decisions. Participating often brings some happiness and a sense of community, but the problem comes when you do it so often that you\u2019re not using your money to achieve your financial goals, or worse, you get into debt, said Erika Rasure, chief financial wellness advisor for Beyond Finance, a financial services company.",
      "Whether it\u2019s coastal grandma or clean girl aesthetic, microtrends can take a significant toll on already-strained budgets as prices rise and Gen Z struggles to pay off debt.",
      "If you find yourself overspending to participate in microtrends, here are some expert recommendations:",
      "Before you click \u201cbuy\u201d on TikTok Shop, it\u2019s best if you take some time to reflect, said Jennifer Seitz, head of education for Greenlight, a financial literacy app for families. Pausing before a purchase can help you discern if the item is something you really want or a fleeting craving.",
      "\u201cThink if you want to put it in a schedule pause, whether it\u2019s 24 hours or even a couple of days if it\u2019s a larger expense,\u2033 Seitz said.",
      "Participating in personal challenges can be a good way to get in the habit of making purchases more deliberate. Back in 2022, Alyssa Barber participated in the no-buy year challenge, where she pledged to stop buying non-essential items for a year.",
      "Barber shares sustainable practices with over 370,000 followers on TikTok, where one of her recurrent themes is how to stop impulse buying. Barber said the challenge gave her perspective on how much she was spending on things she didn\u2019t need. Since then, she has changed her spending habits, focusing mainly on experiences.",
      "Taking a value-based spending approach can help you decide if you should participate in a trend you see online, Rasure said.",
      "If, for example, you want to build an emergency fund, having this goal in mind while shopping can help avoid unnecessary spending.",
      "Quynh Van, a 27-year-old UX designer from Minneapolis, was surprised by the number of ads on TikTok when she created an account after a four-year break from social media. And while being influenced by the ads is inevitable, she believes overspending comes in part from users not having defined goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know who you are or what you like, you\u2019re so driven by over-consumerism and lifestyle creep because you don\u2019t have your values in order,\u2033 Van said.",
      "Rasure recommends using your financial values as a guiding principle for your spending decisions. If you\u2019re not sure of your values, allocate some time to map them out according to your life goals.",

      "If a purchase is one click away, it can make it easier to spend large amounts of money. If you consciously make it a little harder to pay for an item, you can spend more mindfully, Seitz said.",
      "\u201cJust that action of needing to input your payment information rather than just that simple click can help you give to really stop and think about purchases before moving ahead with them,\" she added.",
      "To add barriers, you can remove your credit card details from your computer browser or social media and disable Apple Pay on your phone.",
      "Finances are closely tied to emotions, and often, they evoke negative feelings such as shame or guilt. However, reframing them as an act of self-care can help you spend mindfully, Rasure said.",
      "\u201cIt can help you create boundaries around what you value spending money on, helps you choose intentionally and it feels more like freedom instead of restriction,\u2033 she said.",
      "Your spending habits in the present can help your future financial situation. This mindset can inspire you when you\u2019re tempted to overspend on the newest trending electronic or fashion item.",
      "It can be OK to engage with trends if they bring you positive feelings, Rasure said.",
      "Van decided to participate in the matcha trend, but with moderation. For Barber, physical media, such as old records, DVDs, and cassettes, is on her list of non-negotiable expenses, as she loves collecting these items.",
      "\u201cTrends and engaging them, engaging in them really should spark that happiness or contentment, not the debt that can go with them,\u201d Rasure said.",

      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n says Hungary will keep buying fossil fuels from Russia despite demands from President Donald Trump",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said Friday that Hungary will continue to source fossil fuels from Russia despite demands from his ally U.S. President Donald Trump, and that he'd informed the president that dropping Russian energy would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Hungary's economy.",
      "Hungary remains one of the only countries in Europe to continue purchasing Russian oil and natural gas following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But Trump, an admirer of the long-serving Hungarian leader, earlier this month called on all NATO countries including Hungary to cease purchasing Russian oil, since he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if they did so.",
      "In comments to state radio on Friday, Orb\u00e1n said he recently told Trump that that dropping Russian energy imports would be an economic \u201cdisaster\u201d for Hungary.",
      "\u201cI told the U.S. president ... that if Hungary is cut off from Russian oil and natural gas, immediately, within a minute, Hungarian economic performance will drop by 4%,\" Orb\u00e1n said. \"It means the Hungarian economy would be on its knees.\u201d",
      "Despite three years of efforts by European Union countries to wean off of Russian energy supplies \u2014 an effort to deprive President Vladimir Putin of revenue that helps fuel the war in Ukraine \u2014 Hungarian officials have insisted that geographical and infrastructural constraints make it nearly impossible to transition to using fossil fuels supplied from the West.",

      "However, other countries in the region, including the similarly landlocked Czech Republic, have managed to fully cease their purchases of Russian oil since Moscow launched its invasion. Slovakia, which neighbors Hungary, has also maintained its Russian energy imports.",
      "Yet despite pressure from the EU and the Trump administration, Orb\u00e1n, widely considered the EU leader with the closest relationship to the Kremlin, said Friday that when it comes to energy sources, \"It is clear what is in Hungary\u2019s interest and we will act accordingly.\u201d",
      "Hungary and the United States, he said, \"are sovereign countries. There is no need for either of us to accept the arguments of the other. America has its arguments and interests, and Hungary does too.\u201d",

      "Inducted in the 1960s, the needle-nosed MiG-21 formed the backbone of the Indian air force and saw action in wars with Pakistan and China. But frequent crashes of the supersonic warplane drew safety concerns. Despite several upgrades, the plane\u2019s technology remained outdated and difficult to maintain.",
      "According to official data, India procured 872 MiG aircrafts of various models between 1966 and 1980, making it the biggest operator of the aircraft in the world.",
      "Between 1971 and April 2012, as many as 482 MiG crashes were reported, killing 171 pilots, 39 civilians, 8 service personnel and 1 aircrew. Human error and technical issues were cited as the causes.",

      "On Friday, the fighter was accorded a colorful farewell with a last sortie led by Air Force Chief, Air Marshal AP Singh in the presence of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh at the northern Indian air base of Chandigarh. Upon landing, the fighter was accorded a water canon salute.",

      "Gross profits \u2014 the difference between what an investor paid for a property and what it sold for \u2014 fell 13.6% in the second quarter from a year earlier to $65,300, the firm said.

      "Home flippers buy a home, typically with cash, then pay for any repairs or upgrades needed to spruce up the property before putting it back on the market.",
      "The shrinking profitability for home flipping is largely due to home prices, which continue to climb nationally, albeit at a slower pace, driving up acquisition costs for investors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing very low profit margins from home flipping because of the historically high cost of homes,\u201d said Rob Barber, Attom\u2019s CEO. \u201cThe initial buy-in for properties that are ideal for flipping, often lower priced homes that may need some work, keeps going up.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Former President Bill Clinton opened the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative Wednesday with a list of things that worry him.",
      "\u201cIt would be irresponsible, almost jarring, for us to take off and not acknowledge the traumatic rise in political violence that we\u2019ve seen in our country,\u201d Clinton said about the shooting deaths of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling further and further away from one another.\u201d",
      "Clinton said he worried about the dismantling of domestic and foreign assistance programs, \u201cthe war on science and public health,\u201d cuts to education, trade wars, and being \u201cat risk of losing our freedom of speech.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do everything we can to provide a counterweight to a lot of the negative things that have taken place in the last several months,\u201d Clinton said of the two-day conference, which shifted its format to create working groups to tackle many of the issues he outlined.",
      "The conference\u2019s biggest announcement on Wednesday was a partnership between the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Unitaid, and Wits RHI that will provide Gilead Sciences\u2019 HIV prevention drug lenacapavir in 120 low- and middle-income countries for $40 a person each year, starting in 2027. The Gates Foundation announced a similar agreement with the Indian manufacturer Hetero Labs.",
      "Clinton said the move was partially in response to foreign aid cuts from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which he said could lead to more than 6 million more HIV cases and potentially 4 million more deaths in Africa. In July, GOP leaders stopped an additional cut of $400 million to PEPFAR, a program combating HIV/AIDS credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush.",
      "Points of Light Chairman Neil Bush said PEPFAR and the way it has helped so many in Africa has always been a point of family pride. And though he hasn\u2019t talked to his brother, former President George W. Bush, about the new program announced at the Clinton Global Initiative, Neil Bush said he sees it as a way philanthropy can help fill in gaps.",
      "\u201cIt seems like America\u2019s withdrawal from the world is having terrible ramifications, in my personal view,\u201d he said, adding that Points of Light hopes to increase the help it provides through its ambitious plan to double the number of volunteers in America in the next 10 years.",

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s because they\u2019re not alarmed. I think that\u2019s because they\u2019re afraid. Everybody\u2019s afraid.\u201d",
      "However, President Clinton said that the Clinton Global Initiative, which launched in 2005, has always looked to create solutions.",
      "\u201cIf we hold our heads high, keep our eyes and ears open and deal with others with an outstretched hand and not a clenched fist, we\u2019ve got a chance to keep hope alive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the chance to make a meaningful difference in other people\u2019s lives.\u201d",

      "Streets said she was invited to Universal's Epic Universe theme park just a few weeks before it officially opened to the public in May and went on the dual-launch coaster, which reaches speeds up to 62 mph (100 kph). On the ride, her head shook violently and slammed into her seat's headrest, giving her permanent injuries, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit says Streets has suffered disability, medical care expenses, loss of the ability to work and an exacerbation of a preexisting condition since going on the ride. Her attorney, Nicholas Spetsas, didn't immediately respond Thursday to an email seeking further details on her injuries.",
      "The ride failed to properly restrain her head, and the theme park failed to adequately warn her of \u201cthe unsafe and unreasonably dangerous condition\u201d of the roller coaster, the lawsuit says.",

      "Ticketmaster has committed to changes after facing criticism over ticket sales for Oasis' reunion concerts in the U.K. this summer",
      "LONDON -- A company that came under fire during the sale of tickets for British rock band Oasis' reunion concerts this summer committed Thursday to a series of changes that aim to prevent fans being shocked by the price they end up paying.",
      "Following an investigation by the U.K.'s competition watchdog, Ticketmaster agreed that fans will be armed with much more information before and during their purchase of concert tickets.",
      "\u201cFans who spend their hard-earned money to see artists they love deserve to see clear, accurate information, upfront,\u201d said Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t ensure every fan gets a ticket for events as popular as the Oasis tour, but we can help ensure that next time an event like this comes along, fans have the information they need, when they need it,\u201d she added.",
      "The moves follow the CMA\u2019s investigation into the way Ticketmaster sold over 1 million Oasis tickets last year for the band\u2019s reunion tour.",
      "Many Oasis fans who queued for hours online at the Ticketmaster site were left shocked at having to pay more than double the face value of the ticket. Some standard standing tickets were sold for 355 pounds ($470) as compared to the expected 148 ($195.)",
      "They accused the company of using dynamic pricing, an algorithmic strategy used in flight sales and home food deliveries, where demand levels can fluctuate and lead to surging prices while also sometimes leading to lower prices. It is a more common practice in the U.S. than in the U.K.",
      "Though the regulator did not find evidence that dynamic pricing was used, it concluded that Ticketmaster did not tell fans that standing tickets were being sold at two different prices, and that prices would jump as soon as the cheaper tickets sold out.",
      "Ticketmaster, owned by Live Nation Entertainment, must now tell fans 24 hours in advance if a tiered pricing system is being used, as it was for Oasis standing tickets. That means fans will know beforehand if there are multiple prices for the same type of ticket, and that more expensive ones will be released once the cheapest sell out.",
      "The company must also provide more information about ticket prices during online queues, helping fans anticipate how much they might have to pay. This includes setting out the range of prices available for the event when people join the queue and updating fans swiftly when cheaper tickets sell out.",
      "The CMA said Ticketmaster had made the commitments voluntarily and without any admission of wrongdoing or liability.",

      "Earlier in September, a judge determined that Trump's move to fire Cook probably was illegal. An appeals court rejected an emergency plea to oust Cook before the Fed's meeting last week when Cook joined in a vote to cut a key interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point.",

      "In their filing, lawyers for the former economic officials wrote that immediately ousting Cook \u201cwould expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed\u2019s independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.\u201d",
      "Greenspan, Bernanke and Yellen served as successive chairs of the Fed's seven-member board of governors, spanning six presidential administrations back to 1987. Greenspan and Bernanke were initially appointed by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, respectively. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Yellen to the Fed and she was Democratic President Joe Biden's treasury secretary.",

      "Trump sought to fire Cook on Aug. 25, but a judge ruled that she could remain in her job. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as \u201cprimary residences\u201d in June and July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and a smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a \u201cvacation home,\u201d according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. In a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a \u201c2nd home.\u201d Both documents appear to undercut the administration\u2019s claims of fraud.",
      "The attempt to fire Cook differs from Trump's dismissal of board members of other independent agencies. Those firings, including at the National Labor Relations Board, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission, have been done at will.",
      "In allowing those firings to proceed for now, the Supreme Court cautioned that it viewed the Fed differently. Trump has invoked the provision of the law that set up the Federal Reserve and allowed for governors to be dismissed \u201cfor cause.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune is rejecting Democratic demands on health care as unserious but says a government shutdown is still \u201cavoidable\u201d despite sharp divisions ahead of Wednesday's funding deadline.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that there\u2019s always a way out,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cAnd I think there are off-ramps here, but I don\u2019t think that the negotiating position, at least at the moment, that the Democrats are trying to exert here is going to get you there.\u201d",
      "Thune said Democrats are going to have to \u201cdial back\u201d their demands, which include immediately extending health insurance subsidies and reversing the health care policies in the massive tax bill that Republicans passed over the summer. Absent that, Thune said, \u201cwe\u2019re probably plunging forward toward the shutdown.\u201d",
      "It's just the latest standoff in Washington over government funding, stretching back through several administrations. President Donald Trump was the driving force behind the longest shutdown ever during his first term, as he sought money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. This time it is Democrats who are making demands as they face intense pressure from their core supporters to stand up to the Republican president and his policies.",
      "Democrats have shown little signs of relenting, just before spending runs out Wednesday. Their position remained the same even after the White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday released a memo that said agencies should consider a \u201creduction in force\u201d for many federal programs if the government closes \u2014 meaning thousands of federal workers could be permanently laid off.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the OMB memo was simply an \u201cattempt at intimidation\u201d and predicted the \u201cunnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.\u201d",
      "Thune stopped short of criticizing the White House threat of mass layoffs, saying the situation remains \u201ca hypothetical.\u201d Still, he said no one should be surprised by the memo as \u201ceveryone knows Russ Vought,\u201d the head of the Office of Management and Budget, and his longtime advocacy for slashing government.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s all avoidable,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAnd so if they don\u2019t want to go down that path, there\u2019s a way to avoid going down that path.\u201d",
      "One way to avoid a shutdown, Thune said, would be for enough Democrats to vote with Republicans for a stripped-down \u201cclean\u201d bill to keep the government open for the next seven weeks while negotiations on spending continue. That\u2019s how Republicans avoided a shutdown in March, when Schumer and several other Democrats decided at the last minute to vote with Republicans \u2014 to great political cost when Schumer's party then revolted.",
      "A seven-week funding bill has already passed the House.",
      "\u201cWhat would eight Democrats be willing to support?\u201d Thune asked. \u201cIn terms of a path forward, or at least understanding what that path forward looks like.\u201d",

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky both opposed it in preliminary votes last week. A competing bill from Democrats also fell well short of 60 votes.",
      "Thune suggested some individual bipartisan bills to fund parts of the government for the next year could be part of a compromise, \u201cbut that requires cooperation from both sides,\u201d he said.",
      "Democrats say they are frustrated that Thune hasn\u2019t approached them to negotiate \u2014 and that Trump abruptly canceled a meeting with Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York that had been scheduled for this week. Trump wrote on social media, \u201cI have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.\u201d",
      "Thune said he \u201cdid have a conversation with the president\u201d and offered his opinion on the meeting, which he declined to disclose. \u201cBut I think the president speaks for himself, and I think he came to the conclusion that that meeting would not be productive,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Still, he says he thinks Trump could be open to a negotiation on the expanded health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year if Democrats weren't threatening a shutdown. Many people who receive the subsidies through the marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act are expected to see a sharp rise in premiums if Congress doesn\u2019t extend them.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Even for an agency accustomed to criticism, this summer\u2019s debate over Republicans' big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts was a harsh one for the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "\u201cNotorious for getting it wrong,\u201d was the judgment of Speaker Mike Johnson. \u201cMaking the same mistakes,\u201d was the refrain from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. And President Donald Trump dismissed the CBO as \u201cvery hostile.\u201d",
      "For CBO Director Phillip Swagel, the \u201cincoming fire,\u201d as he calls it, is simply part of the job.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get it right and inform the Congress and the country,\u201d he said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s no agenda here.\u201d",
      "Tasked with producing nonpartisan analysis for Congress, it\u2019s up to Swagel and expert staffers at the CBO to assess the impact of legislation on economic growth and the nation\u2019s finances \u2014 producing \u201cscores,\u201d in the parlance of Washington, that often reverberate across the dominant political debates of the day. Both major political parties often dispute the agency\u2019s findings, particularly when their top priorities are at stake.",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s noise, sometimes it\u2019s not. But we just tune it out. Here we do our work,\u201d Swagel said. \u201cThe thing that I do care about a lot is to make sure our work is accurate.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a low-key approach Swagel has maintained at the CBO since 2019, when congressional leaders appointed him the director after stints in both Republican and Democratic administrations. An economist by trade, Swagel brings an inquisitive and genial approach to the job, his knowledge of government forged by work at the Council of Economic Advisers in the White House, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund.",

      "From the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation plans, to the unprecedented implementation of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world, to massive tax and spending cuts passed into law this summer, assessing the trajectory of the U.S. economy has grown more difficult.",
      "Swagel recently sat down with the AP to talk at length about analyses from his agency, the future of the nation\u2019s entitlement programs and the pressure to remain unbiased when data itself is at risk of being politicized.",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs plan has posed challenges to the CBO's standard models for assessing trade.",
      "The baseline tariffs on all countries and higher rates on Trump's \u201cworst offenders\u201d list are different from what \"we\u2019ve seen in more than 100 years,\u201d Swagel said. It's a dramatic shift away from the low-tariff era that has existed since World War II. \"We\u2019re going to be looking carefully to see if those models still apply, or if tariffs that are this large, do those have effects that we just haven\u2019t counted on?\u201d he said.",
      "So far, the CBO estimates the tariffs could reduce the national deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, helping to offset the deficit increases it projects will result from the Republicans\u2019 big bill passed this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge impact,\u201d Swagel said.",
      "The CBO also anticipates Trump's tariffs will cause roughly two years of elevated inflation, Swagel said, causing price increases for businesses and customers. But he says those effects will be temporary.",
      "\u201cAs the tariffs go up and the prices go up with the tariffs, inflation will be higher, but then prices will get to a higher level and be stable,\" he said. \"And then the inflationary impact will subside.\"",
      "Swagel said there are \u201cpros and cons\u201d when assessing how immigration affects the economy.",
      "\u201cImmigrants have added to our labor force, and that has meant higher GDP. It\u2019s meant more revenue and a lower deficit,\u201d Swagel said. \u201cBut, of course, there\u2019s lots of issues related to immigration,\u201d notably that \u201cmore immigrants put more fiscal pressure on state and local governments \u2014 on schools, on police, on health care systems and other things.\u201d",

      "\u201cAlways visited for half an hour for a cup of tea with the people,\u201d recalled local businessman Feargal McCormack. \u201cHe loved a cup of tea.\"",

      "For the NFL, there was little doubt about which team would play a leading role in the Emerald Isle.",
      "\u201cThe Rooney family name carries a tremendous amount of weight, so when they initially expressed an interest in playing a game in Ireland, it meant that a lot of people sat up and took notice,\u201d said Henry Hodgson, general manager of the NFL UK and Ireland.",
      "\u201cBecause of the connections and the doors that the Rooney family name opens, because they\u2019ve given so much back to Ireland, they certainly helped make this happen,\u201d Hodgson said.",
      "The Steelers were dominating the NFL in the mid-1970s \u2014 winning back-to-back Super Bowls in \u201975 and \u201976 \u2014 when Daniel Rooney turned his attention to the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. He cofounded the Ireland Funds, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to promote peace.",
      "Rooney also cofounded the Newry-Pittsburgh Partnership in 1990 to boost business and educational exchanges.",
      "\u201cThe fact that he was coming to Newry and that he was encouraging delegations to come \u2014 the confidence he gave in those very early years was very significant to ultimately the success which has followed,\u201d said McCormack, a Rooney family friend and senior partner at accounting firm AAB.",

      "SEATTLE -- Only fitting it was Cal Raleigh who catapulted the Seattle Mariners to their first AL West championship in 24 years Wednesday night.",
      "The switch-hitting catcher launched two more homers to give him a major league-best 60 this season, and the streaking Mariners clinched the fourth division crown in the franchise's 49-year history with a 9-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies.",
      "\u201cTo do it in this fashion, on this night, in front of these fans, mom and dad, obviously, was really cool,\u201d Raleigh said.",
      "The lone big league team that's never been to a World Series, Seattle last won the AL West in 2001 when it set an American League record with 116 wins \u2014 thanks in large part to a prolific rookie season from new Hall of Famer Ichiro Suzuki.",
      "But similar to that team, winning the division this year required more than a record-setting performance from one player. In addition to Raleigh, the 2025 Mariners had four other All-Stars: outfielders Randy Arozarena and Julio Rodr\u00edguez, as well as right-hander Bryan Woo and closer Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz.",

      "Even with that All-Star quintet, the Mariners entered the mid-summer break just six games over. 500, a mark that held prior to the July 31 trade deadline. President of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto felt compelled to add to a team that entered August 4 1/2 games back of the division lead, and did so in a meaningful way.",
      "The Mariners acquired slugging third baseman Eugenio Su\u00e1rez and multi-talented first baseman Josh Naylor from the Arizona Diamondbacks, and getting ahold of both has proven to be quite the shrewd move. Since the deadline, the Mariners have gone 31-17, won 16 of their last 17 and clinched a playoff spot on Tuesday night thanks to some late-game heroics from Naylor.",

      "Because of that move, Mickelson has been cast out of what could have been his role as an elder statesman of \u201ctraditional golf.\u201d Outside of azaleas at Augusta National and the Swilcan Bridge at St. Andrews, the Ryder Cup is about as traditional as it gets in this sport.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019m the right guy to be involved with the team because I\u2019m a very divisive character right now, if you will, and I understand that,\u201d Mickelson said last year on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show,\" setting the stage for a call he knew would not come.",
      "One of the ironies is that, six months after he said that, the PGA of America tabbed Keegan Bradley as captain. Bradley and Mickelson were good friends and a successful pairing over the span of two Ryder Cups. They went 4-1 together over 2012 and '14, though that pairing never got much run because the U.S. lost both times.",
      "Back in the early part of his career, Mickelson shrewdly assembled a reputation as a player who seemed just like the rest of us.",

      "For Yiga and colleagues from his Fun Cycling Club, a small but growing community of riders in Uganda, the competition offered a chance to race alongside their heroes and maybe catapult a sport in Africa that has long felt like a pastime.",
      "\u201cThis is so big for the continent,\u201d said Yiga, who took up cycling during the COVID-19 pandemic to ride around lockdown public transport restrictions.",
      "Yiga said he will be excited to see Tadej Poga\u010dar, the reigning road race world champion and four-time Tour de France winner, in this week's championships in Rwanda. The Slovenian rider will compete Sunday in the men's elite road race, with the women's race set for Saturday.",

It does not apply to future works.",
      "\u201cThis is a fair settlement,\u201d Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \u201ccomplicated.\u201d About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\u201cWe have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",

      "\u201cAnthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\u201d said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\u201cThe decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we\u2019ve consistently maintained, the court\u2019s landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \u201cmarks a milestone in authors\u2019 fights against AI companies\u2019 theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors\u2019 rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\u201d",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \u201cback room\u201d dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",

      "Attorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is \u201cconsistent with due process\u201d and the court's guidance.",
      "Alsup had dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.",
      "Bestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.",
      "\u201cTogether, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn\u2019t yours for the taking,\u201d she wrote.",

      "Meta is racing to construct its largest data center yet, a $10 billion facility in northeast Louisiana as big as 70 football fields and requiring more than twice the electricity of New Orleans",
      "HOLLY RIDGE, La. -- In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.",
      "While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.",
      "Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.",
      "Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.",
      "Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t follow the facts, you can\u2019t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,\u201d DeRoche said.",
      "Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts \u2014 equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta\u2019s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.",
      "Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.",
      "Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta\u2019s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.",
      "Meta did not address AP\u2019s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.",
      "Davante Lewis \u2014 the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan \u2014 said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certain information we should know and need to know but don\u2019t have,\u201d Lewis said.",
      "Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to \u201ctens of millions of dollars or more each year\u201d in lost revenue.",
      "Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be \u201cvery little\u201d impact on ratepayers.",
      "But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta\u2019s facility.",

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced that the Stargate AI data center in Texas will be joined by five more across the U.S. This expansion is part of a $500 billion infrastructure investment promoted by President Donald Trump",
      "ABILENE, Texas -- The afternoon sun was so hot that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman traded his usual crewneck sweater for a T-shirt on the last legs of a Tuesday visit to the massive Stargate artificial intelligence data center complex that will power the future of ChatGPT.",
      "OpenAI announced Tuesday that its flagship AI data center in Texas will be joined by five others around the U.S. as the ChatGPT maker aims to make good on the $500 billion infrastructure investment promoted by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "Stargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank, said it is building two more data center complexes in Texas, one in New Mexico, one in Ohio and another in a Midwest location it hasn't yet disclosed.",
      "But it's the project in Abilene, Texas, that promised to be the biggest of them all, transforming what the city's mayor called an old railroad town.",
      "Oracle executives visiting the eight-building complex said it is already on track to be the world\u2019s largest AI supercluster once fully built, a reference to its network of hundreds of thousands of AI computer chips that will be running in its H-shaped buildings.",
      "Altman said, \u201cWhen you hit that button on ChatGPT, you really don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t, at least\u201d \u2014 think about what happens inside the data halls used to build and operate the chatbot.",
      "He and Oracle's new co-CEO Clay Magouyrk also sought to emphasize the steps they've taken to reduce the energy-hungry complex's environmental effects on a drought-prone region of West Texas, where temperatures hit 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re burning gas to run this data center,\u201d said Altman, but added that \u201cin the long trajectory of Stargate\u201d the hope is to rely on many other power sources.",
      "The complex will require about 900 megawatts of electricity to power the eight buildings.",
      "One is already operating, and a second that Altman and Magouyrk visited Tuesday is nearly complete. Each server rack in those buildings holds 72 of Nvidia\u2019s GB200 chips, which are specially designed for the most intensive AI workloads. Each building is expected to have about 60,000 of them.",
      "More than 6,000 workers now commute to the massive construction project each day, in what Mayor Weldon Hurt described as a significant boost to the local economy. The campus and nearby expansion will provide nearly 1,700 jobs onsite when fully operational, Oracle said, with \u201cthousands more indirect jobs\u201d predicted to be created.",

      "The city's chronically stressed reservoirs were at roughly half-capacity this week. Residents must follow a two-day-a-week outdoor watering schedule, trading off based on whether their address numbers are odd or even.",
      "One million gallons of water from the city's municipal water systems provides an \u201cinitial fill\u201d for a closed-loop system that cools the data center's computers and keeps the water from evaporating. After that initial fill, Oracle expects each of the eight buildings to need another 12,000 gallons per year, which it describes as a \u201cremarkably low figure for a facility of this scale.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese data centers are designed to not use water,\u201d Magouyrk said. \u201cAll of the data centers that we\u2019re building (in) this part of Stargate are designed to not use water. The reason we do that is because it turns out that\u2019s harmful for the environment and this is a better solution.\u201d",

      "The closed-loop system shows that the developer is \u201ctaking its impact on local public water supplies seriously,\u201d but the overall environmental effect is more nuanced because such systems require more electricity, which also means higher indirect water usage through power generation, said Shaolei Ren, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who has studied AI's environmental toll.",
      "Indeed, the data center complex includes a new gas-fired power plant, using natural gas turbines similar to those that power warships. The companies say the plant is meant to provide backup power for the data halls and is a better option than traditional diesel generators. Most of the power comes from the local grid, sourced from a mix of natural gas with the sprawling wind and solar farms that dot the windy and sunny region.",

      "The first time most residents heard of Stargate \u2014 at least by that name \u2014 was when Trump announced the project shortly after returning to the White House in January. Originally planned as a facility to mine cryptocurrency, developers had pivoted and expanded their designs to tailor the project to the AI boom sparked by ChatGPT.",
      "The partnership said at that time it was investing $100 billion \u2014 and eventually up to $500 billion \u2014 to build large-scale data centers and the energy generation needed to further AI development. More recently, OpenAI signed a $300 billion deal to buy computing capacity from Oracle. It's a huge bet for the San Francisco-based AI startup, which was founded as a nonprofit.",
      "OpenAI and Oracle invited media and politicians, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to tour the site for the first time Tuesday.",
      "Cruz called Texas \u201cground zero for AI\u201d because if \u201cyou\u2019re building a data center, what do you want? No. 1, you want abundant, low-cost energy.\u201d",
      "Of the other five Stargate data center projects announced Tuesday, Oracle is working with OpenAI to build one just northeast of Abilene, in Shackelford County, Texas, and another in New Mexico's Do\u00f1a Ana County. It also said it is working to build one in the Midwest.",

It was launched in 2017 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of a Rwanda-based gorilla study center founded by Dian Fossey, the American primatologist and conservationist who gained global renown for her research.",
      "The gorillas Fossey studied and looked after were mountain gorillas that belong to the species known as the eastern gorilla and live mostly in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The second species, known as the western gorilla, inhabits areas of west and central Africa.",
      "Gorillas are losing their habitat because of poaching and other threats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both gorilla species as endangered, with three of four subspecies critically endangered.",

      "Humans share much of their DNA with gorillas, and scientists cite figures showing up to 98% similarity. \u201cGorillas are humans\u2019 closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution,\u201d according to the science journal Nature. This kinship with humans is one reason gorillas are susceptible to infections spread through close contact with tourists, researchers and others who come near them. Gorillas are especially vulnerable to the influenza virus, and respiratory illnesses are a frequent cause of death among adult gorillas.",
      "Visitors tracking gorillas in the wild are usually urged to stand at least 7 meters (yards) from the primates \u2014 as well as not to touch them even if they wander, as they sometimes do, closer to people. In her lifetime, Fossey worried that gorilla tourism was injurious to the well-being of gorillas because it might alter their behavior in the wild, but tourism-driven gorilla conservation projects in countries such as Uganda has proved successful over the years.",

Gorilla mothers are just as generous with their offspring, and the \u201clove they show for their youngsters is undeniably deep and evident to everyone lucky enough to observe it,\u201d according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity working to protect the primates. Gorillas can live for over 40 years in the wild.",
      "The powerful majesty of gorillas in the wild is one reason they fascinate tourists. But while they are the largest living primates, they can also seem gentle and meek. An average silverback can weigh up to 180 kilograms (396 pounds). Herbivorous creatures, gorillas eat mostly leaves and the shoots and stems of plants. They may also eat ants and snails.",

      "Major League Baseball\u2019s 11-man competition committee has approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robot umpires are getting called up to the big leagues next season.",
      "Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.",
      "Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "New York Yankees outfielder Austin Slater, one of four players on the competition committee, said three voted in favor after getting support from 22 of the 30 teams. All six management reps voted in favor.",
      "\u201cI think with any sort of technology, there\u2019s not 100% certainty of the accurateness of the system,\u201d Slater said. \u201cI think the same can be said of umpires. So I think it\u2019s just coming to grips with the impact that technology is going to have and whether or not we were willing to live with that error that was associated with the system, even if the error is very, very miniscule.\u201d",
      "Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",
      "Yankees manager Aaron Boone, who leads the American League in ejections for the fifth straight year, called the adoption \u201cinevitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThroughout the year, I\u2019ve been a little not totally on board with it or exactly how it\u2019s going to be implemented but it\u2019s going to be here and hopefully that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \"A lot of the things that Major League Baseball has done I think have been really successful in the changes they\u2019ve made and hopefully this is another one of them.\u201d",
      "Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said players will have to adjust.",
      "\u201cYou can like it, dislike it, it doesn\u2019t matter,\" Vogt said as Cleveland prepared to open a critical three-game series with Detroit. \"It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s going to change the game. It\u2019s going to change the game forever.\u201d",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182).",
      "\u201cI love it. I loved it in spring training,\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. \u201cNot all of the players, but most of the players, if you ask them, they really liked it too. I think it keeps everybody accountable. It keeps everybody on their toes.\u201d",
      "At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.",

      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. The proposal approved Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "\u201cThroughout this process we have worked on deploying the system in a way that\u2019s acceptable to players,\u201d Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cThe strong preference from players for the challenge format over using the technology to call every pitch was a key factor in determining the system we are announcing today.\u201d",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, larger bases, and restrictions on defensive shifts and pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers, and there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a really good eye ... only getting two (challenges), I think a lot of the borderline ones are going to stay the same,\u201d Rangers catcher Kyle Higashioka said. \u201cSo it keeps some of the human element in in the game.\u201d",

      "The gamer's ears \u2014 and those of other \u201cTomb Raider\" fans \u2014 picked up something amiss with the French-language voice of Lara Croft, the game\u2019s protagonist.",
      "It sounded robotic, lifeless even \u2014 shorn of the warmth, grace and believability that French voice actor Fran\u00e7oise Cadol has given to Croft since she started playing the character in 1996.",
      "Gamers and Cadol herself came to the same conclusion: A machine had cloned her voice and replaced her.",
      "\u201cIt's pathetic,\" says Cadol, who straight away called her lawyer. \u201cMy voice belongs to me. You have no right to do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely scandalous,\u201d says Bos. \u201cIt was artificial intelligence.\u201d",
      "Aspyr, the game developer based in Austin, Texas, didn\u2019t respond to e-mailed questions from The Associated Press. But it acknowledged in a post last week on its website that what it described as \u201cunauthorized AI generated content\u201d had been incorporated into its Aug. 14 update of \u201cTomb Raider IV\u2013VI Remastered\" that angered fans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content,\u201d Aspyr's post said. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d",

      "\u201cI took a look and I saw all this emotion \u2014 anger, sadness, confusion. And that's how I found out that my voice had been cloned,\u201d she said in an AP interview.",
      "Cadol says 12 years of recording French-language voiceovers for Lara Croft \u2014 from 1996 to 2008 \u2014 built an intimate bond with her fans. She calls them the \u201cguardians\u201d of her work.",
      "Once the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.",
      "In the update, new chunks of voiceover appear to have been added to genuine recordings that Cadol says she made years ago.",

      "Not only does it sound clunky but it also rings as grammatically incorrect to French speakers \u2014 mixing up the polite and less polite forms of language that they use, depending on who they're addressing.",
      "Gamers were up in arms. Bos posted a video on his YouTube channel that same evening, lamenting: \"It\u2019s half Fran\u00e7oise Cadol, half AI. It\u2019s horrible ! Why have they done that?\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really disgusted,\u201d the 34-year-old said in an AP interview. \u201cI grew up with Fran\u00e7oise Cadol's voice. I've been a \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 fan since I was young kid.\"",

      "Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service\u2019s New York field office, said agents found multiple sites filled with servers and stacked SIM cards, of which more than 100,000 cards were already active. Though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, he described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise and possibly run by nation-state actors \u2014 perpetrators from particular countries.",

      "So what are these SIM farms and what are they capable of?",
      "SIM farms are hardware devices that can hold numerous SIM cards from different mobile operators. These devices then exploit voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to send and receive bulk messages or calls.",

Ferrante, the global head of the cybersecurity practice at FTI, an international consulting firm, said the photos show a very sophisticated and established SIM farm that could be used for any number of nefarious activities, including the potential to overwhelm cellular networks with millions of calls in just a few minutes.",
      "\u201cSo if you can imagine that type of magnitude on cellular networks, it would just overwhelm them and cause them to shut down,\u201d Ferrante said in an interview.

      "Ferrante, who previously served in key security positions at the White House and the FBI, says he's awaiting the results of the investigation before drawing any conclusions about the nature of the setup, but he emphasizes that the scale of the operation shows how simple tools can pose real risks to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe masterminds could have set this up a long time ago and be operating from thousands of miles away,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a stark reminder of how deeply interconnected our world has become, where local vulnerabilities can be exploited globally.\u201d",

      "Robot umpires are coming to the big leagues in 2026 after Major League Baseball\u2019s 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robot umpires are coming to the big leagues in 2026 after Major League Baseball\u2019s 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System.",
      "ABS will be introduced in the form of a challenge system in which the human umpire makes each call, which can be appealed to the computer. Robot umpires have been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, with recent testing done at Triple-A since 2022, MLB spring training this year and at this summer's All-Star Game in Atlanta.",
      "Here's what to know about MLB's robot umps.",
      "Stadiums are outfitted with cameras that track each pitch and judge whether it crossed home plate within the strike zone. In early testing, umpires wore ear buds and would hear \u201cball\u201d or \u201cstrike,\u201d then relay that to players and fans with traditional hand signals.",
      "The challenge system adds a wrinkle. Human umps call every pitch, but each team has the ability to challenge two calls per game. Teams that burn their challenges get one additional challenge in each extra inning. A team retains its challenge if successful, similar to the regulations for big league teams with video reviews, which were first used for home run calls in August 2008 and widely expanded to many calls for the 2014 season.",
      "Only a batter, pitcher or catcher may challenge a call, signaling with the tap of a helmet or cap; and assistance from the dugout is not allowed. A challenge must be made within 2 seconds, and the graphic of the pitch and strike zone is shown on the scoreboard and broadcast feed. The umpire then announces the updated count.",
      "MLB estimates the process averages 17 seconds.",
      "A Hawk-Eye pose-tracking system of cameras tracks pitches and whether they are within a strike zone based on the height of each batter, who is measured without shoes before a team\u2019s first test game. MLB estimated the calibration process at less than one minute for each player.",
      "While the strike zone actually called by big league umpires tends to be oval in shape, the ABS strike zone is a rectangle, as in the rule book.",
      "Developing a consensus on what a computer strike zone should be has been an issue.",
      "MLB has changed the shape of the ABS strike zone several times.",
      "It started with a 19-inch width in 2022, then dropped it to 17 inches \u2014 matching the width of home plate. Narrowing the strike zone led to an increase in walks and only small changes in strikeout rates.",

      "The top of the strike zone was 51% of a batter\u2019s height in 2022 and 2023, then raised to 53.5% in 2024 after pitchers complained. The bottom of the strike zone has been 27% since 2022 after initially being set at 28%. A batter\u2019s stance is not taken into account.",
      "ABS makes the ball/strike decision at the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. The contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube and a strike is a pitch that crosses any part. Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that\u2019s year Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At this year's MLB All-Star Game, four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna\u2019s calls were successful.",
      "Success rate have hovered around 50% in the minors. At Triple-A this season, the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses \u2014 usually catchers \u2014 have been more successful, winning 53.7% of challenges compared to 45% by batters. Challenges increased to 4.2 from 3.9 per game through Sunday.",
      "in 2024 at Triple-A, just 1.6% of first pitches were challenges, but the figure increased to 3.9% for two-strike pitches, 5.2% for three-ball pitches and 8.2% for full counts.",
      "Challenge percentages were higher later in the game. While 1.9% of pitches were challenged in the first three innings, 2.5% were challenged from the fourth through the sixth, 2.8% in the seventh and eighth and 3.6% in the ninth.",

      "VINSKI, Estonia -- Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won\u2019t guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.",
      "From the Baltic to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested it was intentional.",
      "Faced with a growing problem, some EU defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a \u201cdrone wall.\"",
      "NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace after Estonia said Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said.",
      "In Poland, \u201cmost of the drones were not detected,\" said Hanno Pevkur, Estonia\u2019s defense minister. \u201cThis is a real gap we have to solve.\u201d",
      "Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 NATO and EU members that border Russia \u2014 told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.",
      "Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months.",
      "\u201cWhat I need,\u201d said Lt. General Andrus Merilo who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is \u201cgood enough, it\u2019s affordable and can be produced in mass.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine because each drone is a \u201clottery ticket that always wins,\u201d said Kusti Salm a former top official at Estonia\u2019s Defense Ministry.",
      "That\u2019s because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.",
      "Although NATO countries have a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania\u2019s vice-minister of national defense.",
      "When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.",
      "Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, said Salm. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.",
      "Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.",
      "There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy\u2019s drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.",
      "In August, a Ukrainian drone \u2014 possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming \u2014 landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.",

      "\u201cDrones are not mosquitoes,\u201d the Estonian minister said, suggesting they would be unlikely to be zapped by an \u201celectronic wall\u201d along NATO\u2019s borders.",
      "There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high-altitude, that are used in attacks, or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses.",
      "Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach including sensors, \u201celectronic warfare \u2026 also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,\u201d said Merilo.",
      "Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it\u2019s still largely only possible to buy systems that are \u201creally expensive,\u201d take a long time to develop and cannot be mass-produced, Merilo said.",
      "He suggested that\u2019s partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 on the market.",
      "\u201cWe have to understand this game,\u201d Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but \u201cthe question is who \u2014 and how fast they can start producing.\u201d",
      "Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the frontlines.",
      "Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to Salm's company, Frankenburg, to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.",
      "But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.",
      "Europe needs to switch to \u201csemi-wartime thinking\u201d and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, said Godliauskas.",
      "In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe \u201cdoesn't have time\u201d to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian said.",
      "Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas noted.",
      "While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, said T\u016btins. That's because Moscow is using \u201call means possible\u201d to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.",

      "BWINDI, Uganda -- News of a sick or injured mountain gorilla can worry local residents in this mountainous area that\u2019s home to the endangered species. That\u2019s partly because most of the gorillas have been given names, allowing rangers and others to humanize the animal's suffering.",

It\u2019s suffering from what?\u2019\u201d said Joyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide in Uganda\u2019s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. \u201cEven the community people. Everyone is touched.\u201d",

      "Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, is home to many groups of habituated gorillas that have become comfortable in the presence of humans.",
      "Tourists pay a considerable sum \u2014 $800 in permit fees per foreign non-resident \u2014 for the right to see gorillas in their natural habitat. An official revenue-sharing policy channels $10 from each permit back to the local community via their elected leaders, who can invest in projects ranging from water provision to health care. Local communities are also entitled to 20% of all park entry fees generated annually.",
      "Many locals, including reformed poachers living near the park, told The Associated Press that the money generated has ensured the recovery of the species, with habitat encroachment and poaching in decline as wildlife authorities seek to collaborate more with nearby communities.",
      "Philemon Mujuni, a poacher until five years ago, said he once thought of the gorilla as a hostile animal to be killed before it killed him if he ever encountered one. As a boy, he used to follow his father, whom he described as \u201ca senior poacher,\u201d into the forest to help carry the antelopes they pulled from traps.",
      "But in 2020, when poachers killed a beloved gorilla named Rafiki, Mujuni and others formed an organization of former poachers who now say the primates are more important than any other animal.",
      "They serve as community watchdogs, looking out for people who might venture into the forest to set duiker traps that sometimes ensnare gorillas. Their surveillance efforts help support the work of armed rangers who also regularly patrol the park.",
      "\u201cWhen community conservation rangers sensitized us, we said, \u2018Let us reform and stop poaching in the national park of Bwindi,\u2019\u201d Mujuni said. \u201cI can\u2019t go there. Because, through the conservation team from (Bwindi Impenetrable National Park), we get some money from these gorillas we could kill.\u201d",
      "Peter Tumwesigye, one of 128 members of the group of reformed poachers, said gorillas are so important that people whose actions lead to a gorilla's death should be jailed.",
      "\u201cSo that others can learn and never do it again,\u201d he said.",

      "The outlook for mountain gorillas has been positive since 2018, when a survey showed that the population exceeded 1,000. It's a remarkable comeback for a species that faced extinction in the last century.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature, which maintains a list of threatened species, cites the mountain gorilla as endangered, an improvement from its earlier designation as critically endangered. About half of the gorillas live in Uganda.",
      "Besides Bwindi, the only other Ugandan park where gorillas can be tracked in the wild is Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. But that protected area has just one family of gorillas, while Bwindi has 27 groups that can be seen up close by visitors.",

      "\u201cWhen you are the leader, you have all the rights to mate with the females. But when you are not the leader, you don\u2019t need to mate but you can mate secretly. And if the silverback comes to know, then it will be a tug of war,\u201d she said.",
      "At the offices of the Uganda Wildlife Authority in Buhoma, a town outside the park, a group of ranger-guides and porters gathers each morning for the opportunity to earn generous tips from helping tourists navigate the forest.",
      "Groups of trackers are allocated porters, who can even help carry an unfit tourist up the hills and through the undergrowth for around $300.",
      "\u201cThe value of the gorilla money is very critical,\u201d said Gessa Simplicious, a conservationist with the Uganda Tourism Board. \u201cIt helps with building trust, but it also helps in the awareness of the need to conserve.\u201d",

Security Council, with world leaders and diplomats acknowledging AI\u2019s nearly immeasurable capabilities while urging caution about its potential harms in nefarious hands, as well as possible dangers involving military use of the technology.",
      "\u201cThe question is not whether AI will influence international peace and security, but how we will shape its influence used responsibly,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in opening remarks at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cAI can strengthen prevention and protection, anticipating food insecurity and displacement, supporting de-mining, helping identify potential outbreaks of violence, and so much more. But without guardrails, it can also be weaponized.\u201d",
      "The session at this week\u2019s annual high-level United Nations meetup showcased the global awareness of AI\u2019s power, with leaders addressing the possible benefits in areas like medical research and international, in equal measure with warnings for its ability to create and spread misinformation and other ills.",
      "\u201cDeep AI analysis of situation data holds this promise for peace,\u201d said British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, heralding AI's ability to keep \u201cultra-accurate, real-time logistics, ultra-accurate real-time sentiment analysis, ultra-early warning systems.\u201d",
      "But Lammy warned of the \u201cchallenges for armed conflict,\u201d such as \"the risk of miscalculation, the risk of unintended escalation, and the arrival of artificial intelligence-powered chat bots stirring conflict.\u201d",
      "Since the AI boom kicked off with ChatGPT\u2019s debut about three years ago, the technology\u2019s breathtaking capabilities have amazed the world. Tech companies have raced to develop better AI systems even as experts warn of its risks, including existential threats like engineered pandemics, large-scale misinformation or rogue AIs running out of control, and call for safeguards.",
      "The U.N.\u2019s adoption of a new governance architecture is the latest and biggest effort to rein in AI. Previous multilateral efforts, including three AI summits organized by Britain, South Korea and France, have resulted only in non-binding pledges.",

      "Several, including Sierra Leone Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Kabba, stressed the need for the Council to lead the way on ensuring that AI is not used by militaries without human oversight, so as to avert potentially devastating escalations or misfires.",
      "\u201cThe Council can encourage best practices in peace operations, promote safeguards to retain human agency in military uses, and ensure compliance with international law and international humanitarian law,\u201d Kabba said.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 05:21:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Law enforcement experts said the sniper-type shooting at a Dallas ICE facility is part of a frightening trend.",
    "story": [
      "\"This is the next chapter ... in our history of violence,\" one expert said.",
      "As a motive remains under investigation in the fatal sniper-type shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office this week, law enforcement experts said the incident is part of a frightening trend of rifle-wielding shooters targeting politicians, police and others from long distances.",
      "Since an alleged would-be assassin attempted to kill President Donald Trump during a July 2024 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, at least seven sniper-type incidents have unfolded across the country, including the Sept. 10 shooting that claimed the life of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, according to reporting by ABC News.",
      "While such shootings have been part of America's history, including the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, law enforcement experts told ABC News that they have never seen so many sniper-type incidents occurring in such a short amount of time.",
      "\"I believe this is the next chapter, if you will, in our history of violence, specifically active-shooter-type situations,\" Jesse Hambrick, a retired Georgia deputy sheriff and counter-sniper expert, told ABC News.",
      "The latest incident occurred on Wednesday morning when the 29-year-old suspect, identified by federal authorities as Joshua Jahn of Fairview, Texas, opened fire on a Dallas ICE facility, killing a detainee and leaving two others critically wounded, officials said. The victims were shot in an uncovered sallyport at the facility, officials said.",
      "Jahn allegedly planned the attack for months and opened fire from the rooftop of a private office building overlooking the ICE facility, using an 8mm bolt-action rifle he legally purchased in August, Joe Rothrock, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Dallas office, said at Thursday afternoon's news conference.",
      "Rothrock described the shooting as a \"targeted, ambush-style attack\" and that the suspect engaged in a significant, high-degree of pre-attack planning, including researching the targeted building and using apps to track the location of ICE agents.",
      "Federal officials said the suspect, a U.S. citizen who died by suicide, sprayed the length of the building with gunfire and left behind writings leading investigators to believe he wanted to shoot ICE agents, not detainees, and cause terror, federal officials said.",
      "\"Hopefully this will give ICE agents a real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP [armor-piercing] rounds on the roof?\" the suspect allegedly wrote in one handwritten note, according to FBI Director Kash Patel.",
      "Patel disclosed in a social media post on Thursday that the suspect also conducted multiple searches on ballistics and the 'Charlie Kirk Shot Video' before carrying out the attack.",
      "Like the suspect in the Kirk shooting who engraved shell casings found at the scene with messages -- including \"Hey fascist! CATCH! -- authorities said the suspect in the shooting at the Dallas ICE facility also wrote a message on at least one bullet casing found at the crime scene that read, \"ANTI-ICE.\"",
      "Like some of the other sniper shooters who have carried out recent attacks, the suspect seemed prepared to die, Hambrick told ABC News.",
      "\"Here's the reality, very honestly, if someone has no fear of losing their own life, it makes them dang near impossible to prevent from taking somebody else's life,\" Hambrick said.",
      "The shooting at the ICE facility came just two weeks after a gunman perched atop a building at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, shot and killed Kirk as the 31-year-old co-founder of the conservative grass roots organization Turning Point USA was speaking to a large crowd at an outdoor event. The suspect, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was arrested and charged with capital murder.",
      "\"The long-range threat is new, and I think that's all stemming from Butler,\" said Don Mihalek, a former senior U.S. Secret Service Agent, referring to the July 2024 attack on Trump, which killed one rallygoer and injured two others before the shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crook, was fatally shot by a Secret Service counter sniper. \"I think the Butler incident is being copycatted in many ways by other people.\"",
      "Less than a month after the assassination attempt on Trump, a sniper armed with an AR-15 rifle opened fire from an overpass along Kentucky's Interstate 75 near London, hitting a dozen vehicles and injuring eight people, authorities said. The suspect, 32-year-old Joseph Couch, a former member of the Army Reserve, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound following an 11-day manhunt, officials said.",
      "On Sept. 15, 2024, just two months after the first attempt on Trump's life, a Secret Service agent foiled another assassination attempt on the president at Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. The agent spotted the barrel of a rifle sticking out of the fence line and opened fire on the shooter, identified as 59-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, causing him to flee the area. Roth was convicted by a jury on Tuesday and faces a sentence of life in prison.",

Roley was later found dead from suicide, authorities said.",
      "On Aug. 7, a gunman identified by authorities as 61-year-old Carmine Faino shot and wounded two Pennsylvania state troopers in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, with a rifle he allegedly fired \"from a position of tactical superiority\" after calling 911 to report shots fired near a home he shared with a girlfriend he allegedly killed, officials said. Faino was fatally shot by a special emergency response team, officials said.",
      "Three days after the Pennsylvania attack, a sniper opened fire on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention campus in Atlanta, authorities said. The suspect, 30-year-old Patrick White, who officials said blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him sick and depressed, died by suicide.",
      "Mihalek said such sniper shootings present a \"tremendous challenge\" for law enforcement to prevent, particularly at a time when ambush attacks on law enforcement are dramatically increasing.",
      "In a report released on Sept. 2, the National Fraternal Order of Police stated that 229 officers have been shot in the line of duty thus far in 2025, 31 fatally. In 2024, 342 officers were shot in the line of duty, including 50 who were killed, up from 46 in 2023, according to the report.",
      "There have been at least 50 ambush-style attacks on law enforcement this year, resulting in 66 officers being shot, 15 of them fatally, according to the report. In all of 2024, there were 61 ambush-style attacks on law enforcement officers nationwide, resulting in 79 officers shot, 18 fatally, according to the National Fraternal Order of Police.",
      "Amid the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the country, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement this week that ICE officers are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them since January.",
      "In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said security protocols are being ramped up at ICE facilities across the country.",
      "\"Obviously, the next step for us is making sure our officers are safe. That's my biggest fear every night, especially with these increases [in assaults], that everyone gets home safe every night. We've got to make sure our buildings and facilities are protected,\" said Lyons.",
      "Hambrick told ABC News that in the current threat environment, law enforcement agencies nationwide should be reevaluating their security tactics, including working with property owners in their communities to prevent easy access to rooftops.",
      "\"Law enforcement has to think now, 'When I walk into a setting where I'm going to be, I've got to look up, and that's not natural,\" Hambrick said. \"I've got to look around 360 degrees, and I need to secure those roofs.\"",
      "Mihalek said he believes the use of drones to scan the tops of buildings could become routine and help law enforcement agencies protect officers.",
      "\"Drones may become standard procedure in a lot of these law enforcement operations, especially for ICE,\" Mihalek said.",

      "Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, whose administration oversees Medicaid for 3.1 million people in the ninth-largest state, confirmed Thursday that starting next week the state program will lower reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers.",
      "Stein said it wasn\u2019t too late for the Republican-controlled legislature to solve the problem, adding that the rate cuts can be reversed. If no solution can be found soon, many doctors may decide to leave the Medicaid program, leaving Medicaid enrollees in precarious positions, a physician said at the news conference.",
      "\u201cThis will lead to longer wait times, delayed diagnoses and worse health outcomes for the patients of our state, especially for those who live in rural communities and who are already marginalized and underserved,\u201d Dr. Jenna Beckham said at a health care clinic in Raleigh.",
      "Stein's administration has said for several weeks that additional Medicaid funds approved by the General Assembly this summer were still $319 million short of addressing population changes and rising health care costs, and without a fix rate reductions would take effect Oct. 1. GOP lawmakers couldn't agree on a way forward this week as the two chambers failed to agree about spending on two health care projects.",
      "With the legislature next scheduled to meet Oct. 20, Stein said the state Medicaid agency couldn't delay further to avoid deeper future reductions, and he blamed lawmakers in the process. The broad reductions range from 3% for home health and ambulance services to 10% for hospitals, nursing homes and hospice care.",

      "A jury convicted West of capital murder during a robbery and voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence \u2014 a recommendation accepted by the judge.

      "One of the departments included in the Memphis Safe Task Force is Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That has some Latinos worried that the surge will be used to target them at homes, schools and where they work as part of Trump's plan for mass detentions and deportations of immigrants around the country.",

They then communicated those areas to a member of the County\u2019s Office of Emergency Management at the Incident Command center. This person then made a phone call or sent a text message to another OEM staffer located in the Emergency Operations Center, who then updated the system put in place by the third-party vendor and triggered an alert to the public.",

Crudup earned his master's degree in acting there.",
      "After landing his first movie role in 1996's \"Sleepers\" alongside Brad Pitt, Crudup remained wary of leading man roles, aware that his looks would eventually fade. Instead, he sought challenging parts like the lead guitarist Russell Hammond in Cameron Crowe's 2000 film \"Almost Famous.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jimmy Kimmel returned to his long-running late-night show Tuesday, less than a week after network broadcaster ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" over remarks he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "\"It's been overwhelming ... I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days,\" Kimmel joked to open his monologue, going on to thank all those who came out in his defense, including conservatives.",
      "\"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,\" Kimmel said. \"I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\"",
      "The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air.",
      "It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said, \"It's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family.",
      "Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some.",
      "\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,\" Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. \"That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\"",
      "Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.",
      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company \u2026 they welcomed me back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added.",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",
      "Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.",

    "story": [
      "A former stylist for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 who testified against the disgraced music mogul in his federal criminal trial earlier this year \u2014 filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Combs of sexual abuse and violence while he was in Combs' employ.",
      "The 37-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Deonte Nash against Combs and Combs' label, Bad Boy Entertainment, also accuses Combs of sexual battery, human trafficking and false imprisonment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nash said he was hired to be Combs' stylist around 2008, at the age of 21, and worked for him until about 2018. Nash said that during that time period, he also worked as a stylist and creative director for Combs' then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra Ventura, who also accused Combs of sexual abuse in a 2023 lawsuit and gave graphic testimony against him in his trial.",
      "\"Nash personally experienced sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of Defendants during his ten-year employment,\" including \"forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults, physical violence and manhandling, labor trafficking, threats of harm, and threats of death,\" the lawsuit against Combs reads.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Nash was sexually assaulted by Combs on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "Nash said the alleged abuse prompted him to resign in 2018, but Combs \"continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Combs' attorneys for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In one incident that Nash claims occurred in 2013 or 2014, Combs discovered that Nash and Ventura had gone out to dinner in L.A. without Combs' permission. The following day, the lawsuit states, Combs \"threw\" Nash \"onto the car and violently strangled him.\"",
      "On another occasion in 2014, Combs and his security team allegedly entered Nash's home without permission, during which they \"confiscated Mr. Nash's keys and phone while they forcibly searched the house\" for Ventura, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"After enduring years of abuse, I finally found the courage during the criminal trial, and I am now ready to take action,\" Nash said in a statement. \"Sean Combs has never taken accountability for the years of harm he inflicted on me and so many others.\"",
      "In July, following a lengthy trial, the 55-year-old Combs was found guilty of two counts of prostitution-related charges, but acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "He is\u00a0scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "During the trial, Ventura testified that she was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by Combs over the course of their relationship. She testified about a 2016 incident, which was caught on\u00a0surveillance video, that showed Combs violently assaulting her in the hallway of a California hotel.",
      "Nash also testified in the trial that Combs threatened Ventura and that he \"would beat her.\"",
      "Nash testified about a time when Combs allegedly grabbed a sleeping Ventura by the hair and started hitting her \"pretty hard.\" Nash said Ventura's head hit a bed frame and started bleeding, and Combs then told her, Nash and an assistant, \"Look what y'all made me do.\"",
      "Nash testified he dialed 911 but was told to hang up. He said he feared retaliation but did tell some of Combs' employees about the alleged abuse and told jurors Combs got physical with him a few times.",
      "During the trial,\u00a0Combs' attorneys denied the sexual abuse allegations brought by Ventura against their client, and argued that while evidence showed Combs may have lived a party lifestyle, they claimed he did not engage in racketeering conspiracy or sex trafficking.",
      "Nash's lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages and demands a jury trial.",

    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley concocted a bizarre, brazen scheme to try and sell Elvis Presley's iconic home, prosecutors said.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman was sentenced Tuesday to more than four years in federal prison for scheming to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland home and property before a judge halted the brazen foreclosure sale.",
      "U.S. District Judge John T. Fowlkes Jr. sentenced Lisa Jeanine Findley in federal court in Memphis to four years and nine months behind bars, plus an additional three years of probation. Findley, 54, declined to speak on her own behalf during the hearing.",
      "Findley pleaded guilty in February to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She also had been indicted on a charge of aggravated identity theft, but that charge was dropped as part of a plea agreement.",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan before her death in January 2023, prosecutors said when Findley was charged in August 2024. Findley  then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to prosecutors.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Riley Keough, Lisa Marie's daughter, sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "Graceland opened as a museum and tourist attraction in 1982 and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street from the museum is owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises. Presley died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Members of the Presley family, including Elvis, Lisa Marie and Benjamin Keough are buried on the property.",
      "The public notice for the foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother's death.",
      "After the scheme fell apart, Findley tried to make it look like the person responsible was a Nigerian identity thief, prosecutors said. An email sent May 25, 2024, to the AP from the same email as the earlier statement said in Spanish that the foreclosure sale attempt was made by a Nigerian fraud ring that targets old and dead people in the U.S. and uses the internet to steal money.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",
      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\"Mr. Combs's celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs's legacy has been destroyed,\" the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",
      "The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.",
      "Combs will learn his sentencing fate on Oct. 3",
      "Combs faces an Oct. 3 sentencing after his July conviction by a Manhattan jury on two Mann Act charges that outlaw interstate commerce related to prostitution. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.",
      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\"Put simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an 'affirmative indication of innocence,'\" the lawyers said.",
      "\"He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America - yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\" they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they'll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \"have lost all perspective.\"",
      "Combs's career and reputation are ruined, lawyers say",
      "\"Mr. Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,\" they wrote. \"His life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\"",
      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \"devastating consequences,\" including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",
      "Inmate approached Combs with a shiv, lawyers say",
      "Meanwhile, Combs's life in prison has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.",
      "On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.",
      "They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.",
      "He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.",
      "\"Mr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery,\" they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.",
      "Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer",
      "Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.",
      "They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\"",
      "The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura testified that she participated in hundreds of the meetups that were referred to as \"freak-offs\" while she was his most frequent girlfriend from 2007 to 2018.",
      "Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.",
      "Lawyers say a sober Combs looks to new future unlike his past",
      "There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.",
      "Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.",
      "While he was once so depressed in jail that \"there were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department,\" his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.",
      "They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.",
      "The lawyers wrote that the education program has become \"one of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life\" and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.",
      "\"He is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others,\" they said.",
      "Possibility of a pardon",
      "Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told CBS News in July that he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client after another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told\u00a0CNN\u00a0it was her understanding that the defense team \"had conversations in reference to a pardon.\"",
      "But Agnifilo told CBS News, \"I have nothing to do with a possible pardon.\"",
      "\"I have had conversations with nobody,\" Agnifilo said. \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.",
      "\"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'\" Agnofilo said. \"'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.' That's what he said.\"",

      "After being pulled off the air nearly a week ago, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.",
      "The late-night show had been \"pre-empted indefinitely\" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to\u00a0the shooting death\u00a0of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" adding that some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.",
      "The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other late-night hosts have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a \"dark moment for freedom of speech,\" and screenwriter and \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",
      "Carr's comments on Kimmel drew pushback on First Amendment grounds, with the FCC's sole Democrat-appointed commissioner, Anna Gomez, arguing the agency had used Kimmel's \"inopportune joke as a pretext to punish speech it disliked.\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also sharply criticized Carr for urging ABC to crack down on Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and \"right out of 'Goodfellas.'\" Cruz chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
      "ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks. Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said the comments were \"offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.\"",
      "Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "\"Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform,\" Sinclair said last week in a statement.",
      "On Monday night, Sinclair posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",

Last month, Johnson made his first trip to the Venice Film Festival, for what is probably the most ambitious film of his career, \"The Smashing Machine.\" He plays the real-life mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr, a two-time world champion who fought drug addiction and depression.",
      "Johnson endured three hours of makeup and prosthetics a day to look like Kerr, and he's never played anyone quite so real before. But it's something he says he's been aching to do.",
      "\"For years, I've been dreaming and hoping,\" he said. \"My desire was to play not only a dramatic role, but something that I felt like I could really sink my teeth into, and rip myself open. You hear that term. I just didn't want to do drama. I wanted to do something that really allowed me to do that.\"",

      "For \"The Smashing Machine,\" he had to find a way to transform into someone whose whole world was coming apart, like the scene where Mark Kerr loses his first fight. To conjure up the feelings of despair on camera, Johnson knew right where to go. \"I went back to what it's like being a 15-year-old kid and coming home and being evicted,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"You said it felt like you were ripping yourself open. What do you think that did for you, Dwayne Johnson, ripping yourself open like that?\"",
      "\"The thing that I was running from, which was ripping myself open, is actually the thing that I needed the most,\" he replied, \"because it made me realize that the thing I love, which is acting and telling these stories, now I see it in a different world.\"",
      "These days, Johnson talks a lot about gratitude. At his property in Virginia, far from the trailer in Mississippi, he said, \"Even more reason to be grateful.\"",

      "\"No,\" she replied. \"You couldn't convince Elvis on anything unless he believed in it or, you know, thought about it.\"",
      "She said doctors would basically give him anything he wanted, enabling him. \"He was Elvis; you're not going to say no to Elvis,\" she said.",
      "In his absence sat Graceland, the Memphis mansion that had been hemorrhaging money. The urge was to sell. Priscilla said, \"And I looked at the guy who was telling me, the attorney, and I said, 'That will never happen, ever.'\"",
      "Instead, she opened it to the public. It went from a home to a family shrine.",
      "By the time Lisa Marie turned 25, Elvis' inheritance was hers. It was 1993, the same year another King popped the question \u2026 the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.",
      "Priscilla recalled, \"We were walking on the beach, and she said, 'Mom, you know, Michael wants to get married.' I said, 'Lisa, I'm not really for it.' And she goes, 'Why not.' And I go, 'Who are you? Michael Jackson, Lisa Presley?' And I knew that Michael loved attention, which he did. I knew that's the reason why. They didn't even know each other that long.\"",
      "Priscilla was no fan of another celebrity, O.J. Simpson. She worked with him on the \"Naked Gun\" series. \"He could be very, very nice, but I just didn't, I just felt something about him in the way he was with his wife, and it didn't set well with me,\" she said.",
      "That said, Priscilla was a huge fan of co-star Leslie Nielsen.",
      "Before \"Naked Gun,\" Priscilla had never done comedy. She was thought of in most circles as a more serious actor after her role in \"Dallas\" a few years before.",
      "\"Dallas\" was a spotlight the size of Texas, and Priscilla's role as Jenna Wade put her in the pop zeitgeist all over again.",
      "She left the series after having her second child, Navarone, with her longtime partner Marco Garibaldi.",
      "In 2023, her last physical link with Elvis left. Lisa Marie Presley died suddenly at her home in California from complications after bariatric surgery, and once again the Presley name was draped in grief.",
      "\"I miss her every day,\" Priscilla said. \"I miss her, but I have to let that go and live my life. But her spirit is still with me very, very much.\"",
      "She's buried at Graceland, like her dad. Priscilla says she will be there one day, too. For her, the first home she had as a married woman will be her last.\u00a0 That's not looking backward, she says; it's a comfort for the future.",
      "\"When you stop and think about it, we're not here that long. We're not,\" Priscilla said. \"All of a sudden we're older and we think, Wow, I don't want to hold on to bad things. I don't want to hold on to, you know, things that are in the past that happened. I want to move forward.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 00:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks.\u00a0 And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?'\u00a0 \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",
      "Sara  Moniuszko and \n                                                  \n                                  Dr. C\u00e9line  Gounder\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.",
      "\"This is a fair settlement,\" Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \"complicated.\" About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\"We have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",
      "The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a \"major step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.\"",
      "\"Anthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\" said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\"The decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we've consistently maintained, the court's landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\" said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \"marks a milestone in authors' fights against AI companies' theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors' rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\"",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \"back room\" dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",
      "Alsup's main concern centered on how the claims process will be handled in an effort to ensure everyone eligible knows about it so the authors don't \"get the shaft.\" He had set a Sept. 22 deadline for submitting a claims form for him to review before Thursday's hearing to review the settlement again.",
      "The judge had raised worries about two big groups connected to the case \u2014 the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers \u2014 working \"behind the scenes\" in ways that could pressure some authors to accept the settlement without fully understanding it.",
      "Attorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is \"consistent with due process\" and the court's guidance.",
      "Alsup had dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn't illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.",
      "Bestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.",
      "\"Together, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn't yours for the taking,\" she wrote.",

      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some could see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. As details on the deal trickled out from the administration last week, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China Committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Congress set clear legal safeguards for a deal, including precluding any cooperation with ByteDance or its affiliates on TikTok's recommendation algorithm, and prohibiting any ongoing operational relationship between a new TikTok and ByteDance,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"Based on initial reports, I am concerned the reported licensing deal may involve ongoing reliance by the new TikTok on a ByteDance algorithm and application that could allow continued CCP control or influence.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

      "The overhaul will cost $1 billion, according to a Thursday regulatory filing. Most of the costs are related to the store closures, such as $450 million in costs for breaking leases early. About $150 million will cover expenses for cutting the 900 employees, who Niccol said are \"nonretail\" workers.",
      "Niccol disclosed the plan in a letter to employees, but didn't specify how many locations would be shuttered. He did note that after adding some new locations over the last year, the company's overall store count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025.",
      "The company will end its current fiscal year with about 18,300 locations, he added. In its 2024 fiscal year, the company had 18,424 coffee shops.",
      "The overhaul comes as part of Niccol's \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, a strategy designed to revitalize its coffee shops and convince consumers to return to the stores. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales have slowed amid heightened competition from rivals such as Dunkin'.",
      "\"[W]e identified coffeehouses where we're unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed,\" Niccol wrote in the letter.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration is transitioning to electronic payments next week after 85 years of issuing paper checks to U.S. retirees.",
    "story": [
      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",
      "Exceptions for some paper checks",
      "While the agency is pulling away from paper checks, there are some exceptions. The spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the agency will continue to issue paper checks to people who have no other way to receive payments, echoing what it\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0in July after it announced the move to electronic payments.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary. After filing her retirement claim in 1939, she stopped by the Social Security office in Rutland, Vermont, the town where she once attended school, to inquire about her benefits. She had paid into the relatively new program for about three years, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"It wasn't that I expected anything, mind you, but I knew I'd been paying for something called Social Security and I wanted to ask the people in Rutland about it,\" she said.",
      "Fuller's first monthly check, issued on January 31, 1940, was for $22.54.",

      "Amazon agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a Federal Trade Commission case over whether it duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it difficult for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "As part of the settlement, announced Thursday, Amazon will provide $1.5 billion in refunds to customers that were harmed by what FTC referred to as \"deceptive Prime enrollment practices.\" About 35 million Prime customers who were impacted by the practices could qualify for $51 each as part of the settlement, the FTC said in legal documents.",
      "Amazon is also required to pay a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in any FTC rule violation case to date. The FTC said the $1.5 billion payout to customers is the second-highest restitution award in the agency's history.",
      "Prime customers who are eligible for the payout include those who may have signed up for a membership via the company's \"Single Page Checkout\" between June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025. Amazon must distribute the payments to all affected customers within 90 days, according to the court order.",
      "\"The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,\" FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a statement, adding, \"Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.\"",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the complaint, according to the legal documents. In a statement shared with CBS News, the company said Amazon and its executives have \"always followed the law\" and that the settlement allows them to \"move forward and focus on innovating for customers.\"",
      "In addition to offering compensation to impacted customers, the FTC said Amazon was also required to make changes to its Prime enrollment and cancellation practices, which documents showed that company executives and employees knowingly discussed. The changes included adding a \"clear and conspicuous\" button to its site for customers to decline a Prime membership offer.",
      "In addition, the e-commerce giant was told to make it easier for Prime members to cancel their membership.",
      "\"The process cannot be difficult, costly, or time-consuming,\" the FTC said in its statement.",
      "A spokesperson for Amazon said in an email that the changes outlined by the FTC press \"have already made, many of them years ago.\"",
      "The FTC's efforts to make it easier for customers to cancel subscriptions extend beyond Amazon. In 2024, the commission approved a \"click-to cancel rule,\" which would have allowed consumers to more quickly end streaming services, gym memberships, product deliveries and other subscriptions. The rule had been set to take effect July 14, but was blocked by a federal court that month.",
      "\"We hope the FTC resurrects the click-to-cancel rules to protect millions of consumers from shady sales tactics,\" said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonprofit public interest group, in en email. \"In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement sends a strong message to any company operating in ways that could conceivably confuse customers or thwart their efforts to not be customers any more.\"",
      "Thursday's settlement, which came\u00a0two days after a jury trial kicked off in Seattle, represents the culmination of a two-year case that the FTC began in June 2023.",
      "Amazon Prime provides subscribers with perks that include faster shipping, video streaming and discounts at Whole Foods for a fee of $139 annually, or $14.99 a month.",
      "It's a key and growing part of Amazon's business, with more than 200 million members. In its latest financial report, the company\u00a0reported in July\u00a0that it booked more than $12 billion in net revenue for subscription services, a 12% increase from the same period last year.",
      "That figure includes annual and monthly fees associated with Prime memberships, as well as other subscription services such as its music and e-books platforms.",
      "In a separate case, the FTC is looking into whether Amazon has allegedly engaged in monopolistic behavior that allows it to inflate prices and suppress competition from rivals in violation of antitrust laws.",

    "summary": "The buyers of distressed brick-and-mortar companies like RadioShack and Modell's Sporting Goods, are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
    "story": [
      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",

    "summary": "The U.S. economy's 3.8% growth from April through June represents a significant upgrade of the government's previous estimate.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, the government\u00a0reported Thursday in its final revision of gross domestic product data for April through June.",
      "U.S. GDP \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 rebounded in the spring from a 0.6% first-quarter drop caused by fallout from President Donald Trump's trade wars, the Commerce Department said. The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure.",
      "Consumer spending buoyed the economy in the second quarter, rising at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. The data provides evidence that Americans continued to open their wallets despite broader economic headwinds such as tariffs and a slowing job market, economists noted.",
      "\"That was a meaningful bump-up from the previous estimate of 3.3% thanks to the mighty consumer,\" Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO, said in a Thursday report. \"Today's run of data suggest that the economy \u2014 which strongly rebounded after the pandemic recession \u2014 continues to hold up well, even as we anticipate some slowdown ahead.\"",
      "Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government's previous estimate of 1.2%.",
      "The stronger-than-expected GDP data provides evidence that the economy remains on a solid footing, which may dampen the Federal Reserve's enthusiasm for additional rate cuts in 2025 and early 2026, economists noted. The central bank last week issued its first rate cut of 2025 when it reduced\u00a0its benchmark rate by one-quarter point, with the Fed penciling in two additional cuts in 2025.",
      "When announcing the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to a weakening labor market as prompting the move. Because rate reductions make it cheaper for businesses to borrow and expand, they can help bolster hiring and support the labor market.",
      "\"The Fed's September dot plot indicated that additional rate cuts are likely at their next two decisions in late October and December, but the case for back-to-back cuts is no slam dunk\" after today's GDP data, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in a Thursday email.",
      "Fed officials will be watching even more closely than unusual when their favorite inflation gauge \u2014 the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 comes out Friday.",
      "Rebound from first quarter",
      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports \u2014 which are subtracted from GDP \u2014 as businesses hurried to bring in foreign goods before Trump could impose sweeping taxes on them. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government's previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",
      "But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth.",
      "Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter.",
      "Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% \u2014 \"not great but much better than initially thought.''",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has added double-digit taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country and targeted specific products for tariffs, including steel, aluminum and autos. The president sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the U.S. and to help pay for the tax cuts he signed into law July 4.",
      "Thursday's GDP report was the Commerce Department's third and final look at second-quarter economic growth. It will release its initial estimate of July-September growth on Oct. 30.",
      "Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet currently expect GDP growth to slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% in the third quarter.",

    "story": [
      "Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers.",
      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",
      "Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.",
      "\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less,\" Challenger said.",
      "Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey\u00a0of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.",
      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-new-fee-immigration-impact-american-workers/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",

    "summary": "The Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" spending and tax law will result in cuts to food stamp benefits for many Americans, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people who receive food stamps could soon see smaller benefits or even get kicked out of the program due to changes that are starting to roll out from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, according to several analyses from the federal government and public policy think tanks.",
      "About 2.4 million people, or about 6% of enrollees, could lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), in an average month, because of the new law's changes, which include stricter work requirements, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.",
      "Millions more will see their monthly benefit amounts shrink because of other changes mandated by the law, such as a new restrictions on how an individual's benefits are calculated, it added. The total pool of people who will either be cut off from SNAP or see smaller monthly benefits could reach 22.3 million U.S. families, according to a July analysis from the Urban Institute.",
      "About 42 million individuals in 22.3 million households received food stamps in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on the program.",
      "While SNAP is funded by the USDA, every U.S. state is in charge of administering the program to its residents, with those administrative costs split between the federal and state governments. Some states are already beginning to implement some of the new law's food stamp restrictions, such as Pennsylvania, which is mandating the stricter work rules starting Nov. 1.",
      "The changes are arriving at a precarious time for many, with grocery costs continuing to rise and poverty rates inching higher for senior citizens and Black Americans, according to new Census data. Anti-hunger advocates warn that reduced SNAP benefits could worsen food insecurity, undermining one of the nation's most effective safety nets credited with lifting 3.6 million people out of poverty last year, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned that the cuts to SNAP will lead to an increase in hunger,\" Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy analysis for Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger nonprofit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are looking at households that don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in their budget, so that makes every SNAP dollar very precious in extending that food budget.\"",
      "Tracking the impact of those SNAP cuts on food insecurity as the changes unfurl over the coming months and years may be difficult, given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sept. 20 announcement that it is halting its annual Household Food Security Report, which measures whether American families have access to healthy food.",
      "The USDA said it is nixing the report because it is \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous\" and leads to \"fear mongering.\" But anti-hunger advocates say scrapping the report could ultimately obscure the impact of the Republicans' cuts to the food stamp program.",
      "\"I don't see how it's redundant \u2014 the USDA puts out the only report on food insecurity,\" Vega said. \"It just indicates to me that they don't want to see the results of the reconciliation bill,\" referring to the Republican's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about that claim.",
      "New work requirements",
      "New work requirements for SNAP recipients are taking effect as the labor market stalls, raising the risk that more people could lose access to food stamps under the stricter rules mandated by the Republican law, advocates say.",
      "\"It's a tough workforce right now, and the work requirements come without any support,\" Gina Plata-Nino, a food stamp expert at the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our most vulnerable will have even less access to resources.\"",
      "The new work rules expand what the federal government considers so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, who are adults without young children who must prove they are either working, volunteering or engaged in an education or training program for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food stamps.",
      "Previously, the work requirements only applied to people between 18 to 54 years old, but the new law pushes that to age 64. Additionally, people who are former foster youth between 18 to 24 years old, veterans or homeless are no longer exempt from the work requirements, as they were previously.",
      "People who don't meet the work requirements will be limited to receiving food stamps for three months within a three-year period.",
      "\"Just off the bat, those are veterans, youths aging out of foster care \u2014 think about what it means to be unhoused, trying to get a job when you don't have a place to shower,\" Plata-Nino said. \"Again, these populations are going to be worse off.\"",
      "Work requirements have been championed by Republican lawmakers because they say the rules encourage people to be gainfully employed or engaged in the community in exchange for food aid.",
      "But anti-hunger advocates argue the rules often bump people off the program because they may face difficulties in filing paperwork. Others point out that low-income workers may struggle to get enough hours from their employers to meet the new federal requirements, especially given the proliferation of \"just in time\" scheduling, which slots workers into short shifts to reduce costs for employers.",
      "Prior to the changes, most SNAP recipients who were required to work were doing so, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Stricter aid calculations",
      "Under the new GOP tax and spending law, there are other changes going into the SNAP program that could reduce benefits for millions.",
      "For instance, SNAP applicants can deduct their utility costs from their incomes when calculating their benefits, which can help to increase their food-stamp allotments. But the new law now prevents food-stamp recipients from counting internet expenses as part of their household costs when determining benefits. That change went into effect as soon as the law was signed on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "\"Roughly 65% of participating households will see their benefit drop by an average of $10 a month\" because of the exclusion in using internet costs to calculate benefits, Vega said.",
      "\"It's a relatively small amount but for a household facing rising grocery cost and facing tough decisions, $10 can make a difference,\" she added.",
      "Longer-term, there are additional changes that could strain states' ability to provide food stamps, such as a shift in fiscal year 2027 requiring that states cover 75% of administrative costs, up from 50% now. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states with high error rates \u2014 such as over- and underpayments of SNAP benefits \u2014 will also need to provide more funding for the program, starting in 2028.",
      "One concern, according to Vega, is whether states will have the financial resources to cover those additional costs.",
      "\"It's uncharted territory,\" she said. \"We do worry some states might decide they can't take that level of liability and won't participate in SNAP.\"",

      "Introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act signed, the federal tax credits \u2014 $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used \u2014 are being phased out due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is also\u00a0ending a series\u00a0\u00a0of other clean energy credits over the next several months.",
      "With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in. EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.",
      "\"As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,\" Cox Automotive said in its report.",

The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.",

      "September 2025 could end up being the \"single biggest EV month in history,\" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.",
      "\"It is the concern,\" Horvick said. \"It could be challenging.\"",
      "As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other\u00a0policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.",
      "But not all experts believe the expiration of the tax credit will have a huge effect on future EV sales, and that's simply because sales were low to begin with.",

    "story": [
      "Americans will dish out more money to heat their homes this winter as electricity and natural gas costs continue to soar.",
      "That's according to a new study from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) which predicts that\u00a0Americans will see their energy bill rise 7.6% to $976 on average this cold weather season. Those who rely on natural gas to heat their home could see an 8.4% jump in their bill, while those who use electricity could see a 10.2% increase.",
      "While electricity\u00a0prices vary\u00a0by state, overall the cost is rising. In August, prices increased by 6.2% compared with the same month last year, according to the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Those costs will continue to escalate as much as 18% in the next few years, according to a May\u00a0report\u00a0from The U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Natural gas prices are up 13.8% from last year, far outpacing the rate of inflation, which rose 2.9% in August on an annual basis.",
      "Not all Americans will see an increase in their winter energy bills. Heating oil and propane users \u2014 roughly only 10% of U.S. households \u2014 could see their energy bills decrease by 4% and 5% respectively.",
      "The overall rising home-heating costs follow greater summer air-conditioning use, amid warmer temperatures. \"The average summer household electricity bill reached an estimated $776 in 2025, the highest in at least 12 years compounding household strain,\" the report states.",
      "\"We had a period of relatively stable electric bills and then last year electricity went up twice the rate of inflation,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As a result, more American households are falling behind on their energy bills.",
      "Since Dec. 31, 2023, energy arrearages \u2014 unpaid energy bills that homeowners owe to their utility company \u2014 have risen by about 31%, from approximately $17.5 billion to $23.0 billion by June 30, 2025, NEADA said in its report.",
      "The surge in energy arrearages comes as Americans are carrying\u00a0record amounts of debt. With inflation continuing to ramp up the cost of daily living, ahead of wages, total household debt reached $18.39 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with unpaid credit card balances exceeding $1.21 trillion.",
      "Why are energy prices rising?",
      "The main factors driving up energy prices is the ongoing high cost of maintaining and upgrading the grid, along with rising natural gas prices and increasing electricity demand from data centers according to the NEADA report.",
      "\"As demand goes up and supply is not matching that, prices are going to go up,\" Abe Scarr, director of the Energy and Utilities Program at the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), told CBS MoneyWatch",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine also\u00a0created volatility\u00a0in energy prices, government data shows.",
      "So far this year, approximately 60 utility companies have either increased electricity and gas prices or proposed further increases,\u00a0according to the Center for American Progress, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. With more rate hikes on the horizon, American households will have to try to stretch their income even further.",

      "How to lower your utility bills",
      "As winter approaches, what can Americans do to lower their utility bill?",
      "Scarr suggests that people check with their utility companies, which often offer incentive programs to help customers implement cost-saving measures. Offerings vary by utility, but many companies provide free home energy assessments and discounts for people who want to insulate their homes.",
      "For those interested in fortifying the envelope of their home to minimize heat loss, options include hiring a contractor for a professional retrofit or, for straightforward insulation projects, DIY tips, he said.",
      "When it comes to general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. While it might seem obvious, people can also turn down the temperature in the home a few degrees to save money, said Scarr.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1b-visa-faq-100000-fee-uscis/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:09:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Heavy new H-1B visa fee raises numerous questions, immigration law experts told CBS News. Here's what employees and employers should know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.",
      "The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.",
      "Over the weekend, the White House sought to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"",
      "After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers.",
      "Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration published a proposal to change how H-1B visas are allotted, switching from a randomized lottery to a system that would favor immigrants with higher skills and incomes.",
      "CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy \u2014 here's what to know.",
      "Who pays the $100,000 fee?",
      "Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees \u2014 roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said.",
      "Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.",
      "\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",
      "When does the fee go into effect?",
      "The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House\u00a0statement.",
      "Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.",
      "What are the main issues for current H-1B holders?",
      "According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"",
      "H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time \u2014 the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing.",
      "Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.",
      "\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel \u2014 are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"",
      "Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"",
      "\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.",
      "For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.",
      "\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.",
      "Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.",
      "How does the new fee impact the H-1B program?",
      "The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.,\u00a0Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.",
      "Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS\u00a0report.",
      "What about the national security exemption?",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.",
      "For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said.",
      "\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-us-china-deal-trump/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:12:12 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "When it announced legal action against Amazon two years ago, the FTC said consumers who used Amazon to make purchases were presented with numerous options to subscribe to Prime, but that it was less clear how to buy an item without signing up for a membership. In some cases, the button for Amazon users to complete their purchase did not clearly indicate that they were also agreeing to enroll in Prime, according to regulators.",

    "summary": "The two sides will spend the next two weeks presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that threatens to dismantle the search giant's empire.",
    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",

      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",

When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

      "The Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.",
      "President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.",
      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",

      "President Trump's Justice Department charged former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday with lying to Congress, an unprecedented step against a longtime Trump foe that revisits controversies over the FBI's Trump-Russia probe from nearly a decade ago.",
      "A grand jury in Northern Virginia voted to indict Comey on two counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. In an unusual move, the grand jury voted against indicting him on an additional charge of making a false statement.",
      "The criminal charges revolve around a Senate hearing in September 2020, when lawmakers grilled Comey \u2014 who was fired by Mr. Trump three years earlier \u2014 about how he handled the FBI's 2016 investigations into pro-Trump election meddling by Russia and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Both election-year probes have drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years.",
      "The five-year statute of limitations for charges out of that hearing would have expired next week.",
      "Comey asserted in an Instagram video that he is innocent.",
      "In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the indictment \"reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"",
      "Count 1: Comey accused of lying about media leaks",
      "The first count against Comey that was approved by the grand jury accuses him of breaking a federal law that makes it a crime to make \"any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\" to a federal body, including Congress.",
      "The charge hinges on a combative back-and-forth between the former FBI director and Republican Sen.Ted Cruz of Texas during the Sept. 30, 2020, Senate hearing.",
      "In the hearing, Cruz pressed Comey on whether he had ever authorized another FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in any media reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations involving Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comey had answered no to a similar question during another Senate hearing in 2017. But Cruz said in the 2020 questioning that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe \u2014 another Trump foe \u2014 has \"publicly and repeatedly stated that he leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and that you were directly aware of it and that you directly authorized it,\" referring to an article about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false,\" the senator said to Comey. \"Who's telling the truth?\"",
      "\"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony,\" replied Comey.",
      "Thursday's indictment alleges that this statement is false because Comey \"then and there knew, he in fact had authorized [an unnamed person] to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation.\"",
      "A 2018 report by the Justice Department inspector general's office says Comey and McCabe discussed the Wall Street Journal article after it came out, but gave investigators competing stories about their meeting. Comey told the watchdog that McCabe \"led him to believe\" that McCabe hadn't authorized the release of any information to the Journal. But McCabe said he told Comey a day after the article was published that he'd approved the release himself, and Comey replied that it was a good idea.",
      "The report says \"the overwhelming weight of that evidence supported Comey's version of the conversation,\" and McCabe \"lacked candor\" in his conversation with Comey.",
      "McCabe later told \"60 Minutes\" he did not intentionally mislead the inspector general.",
      "McCabe was fired in 2018, days before he was set to retire.",
      "Count 2: Obstructing a congressional proceeding",
      "Comey was also indicted Thursday for allegedly trying to \"influence, obstruct and impede\" an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee by \"making false and misleading statements.\" The indictment does not say what alleged false statement led to the obstruction charge.",
      "Grand jury rejects a charge against Comey",
      "A majority of the Alexandria, Virginia-based grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court Thursday.",
      "In order for federal prosecutors to criminally indict somebody, they need to convince most members of a 23-person grand jury that they have \"probable cause\" to believe a crime was committed \u2014 a much lower bar than the one needed to convict somebody.",
      "It's very rare for grand juries to decline an indictment. In the 2016 fiscal year, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against somebody because the grand jury didn't return an indictment only six times, out of more than 150,000 suspects who were investigated that year, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "In recent months, however, grand juries in Washington, D.C., have rejected several requests for indictments by the Justice Department, including a possible felony charge against a person who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent. Former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou told CBS News earlier this month that trend \"suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors.\"",
      "The unsuccessful count against Comey would have accused him of illegally making false statements to Congress during a line of questioning by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in September 2020.",
      "Graham had asked Comey if he remembered getting a lead from the intelligence community in September 2016 that alleged Hillary Clinton's campaign \"was going to create a scandal regarding Trump and Russia\" in order to distract from her use of a private email server.",
      "Comey replied: \"That doesn't ring a bell\" \u2014 which the Justice Department called false.",
      "The allegation about Clinton's campaign first surfaced in 2020, when it was declassified by Mr. Trump's Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. Clinton campaign officials denied the accusation to Justice Department special counsel John Durham, a Trump-era prosecutor tasked with reviewing the Russia probe. But Durham said in a 2023 report that FBI investigators looking into possible Trump-Russia ties should've paid more attention to the claims.",

      "During that hearing, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas asked Comey about earlier testimony in 2017 denying having been an anonymous source or authorizing another FBI official to be an anonymous source for news reports about the FBI's investigations into Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton. The probe involving Clinton examined her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.",

      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some could see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. As details on the deal trickled out from the administration last week, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China Committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Congress set clear legal safeguards for a deal, including precluding any cooperation with ByteDance or its affiliates on TikTok's recommendation algorithm, and prohibiting any ongoing operational relationship between a new TikTok and ByteDance,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"Based on initial reports, I am concerned the reported licensing deal may involve ongoing reliance by the new TikTok on a ByteDance algorithm and application that could allow continued CCP control or influence.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

      "President Trump said Thursday he will not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank, an idea that has circulated among members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.",
      "\"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,\" the president told reporters during an Oval Office event. \"There's been enough. It's time to stop now.\"",
      "The president's comments come after several media outlets reported that Mr. Trump privately assured the leaders of Arab and majority-Muslim states this week that he would push back against any Israeli effort to annex the occupied territory.",
      "In recent days, several Western countries \u2014 including France, the United Kingdom and Canada \u2014 have moved to recognize a Palestinian state, leading Netanyahu to pledge some kind of response. Some hardline members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have pressed the Israeli government to react by annexing much of the West Bank, though it's unclear whether Netanyahu will seek to take that step.",
      "Netanyahu did not immediately publicly respond to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. Most proposals for an independent Palestinian state have involved Israel ceding control over the vast majority of the West Bank.",
      "If Israel annexed some or all of the West Bank, formally entrenching its control over the territory, it could make forming a Palestinian state virtually impossible. The move could also upset U.S.-allied Arab countries, some of which have sought to improve their relations with Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, calling the growing pressure on the issue an \"absurd prize for terrorism\" last weekend.",
      "Netanyahu's government has faced increasing international pressure over its handling of the Israel-Hamas war, which has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip's infrastructure and killed more than 60,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were militants or civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed numerous generals and admirals, as well as some of their staff, from around the world to come to Quantico, Virginia, next week, U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,\" said chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell. President Trump earlier this year signed an executive order renaming the Defense Department as the Department of War and Hegseth as Secretary of War, but the name can only officially be changed by Congress.",
      "The Pentagon has provided no other details about the meeting to either the military leaders or the press.",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported in The Washington Post.",
      "There are regularly scheduled meetings with senior military leaders, but a meeting of this size \u2014 in person and on such short notice \u2014 is rare, if not unprecedented.",
      "Asked Thursday about the planned meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"I love it.\"",
      "\"Let them be friendly with the generals and admirals from all over the world,\" he said. \"Is there something wrong with it?\"",
      "Hegseth earlier this year said the Pentagon plans to cut down the number of generals and flag officers \u2014 that is, those holding the rank of at least rear admiral in the Navy or brigadier general in the Army, Air Force or Marines. The goal, according to a May memo, is to cut 20% of the four-star positions in the active-duty force and 20% of the generals in the National Guard.",
      "During his first few weeks on the job, Hegseth held a town hall at the Pentagon and promised to look into whether every four-star general or admiral is necessary.",
      "\"We won World War II with seven four-star generals,\" Hegseth said in February. \"Today, we have 44. Do all of those directly contribute to warfighting success? Maybe they do, I don't know, but it's worth reviewing to make sure they do.\"",
      "It's not clear whether Hegseth is expected to address reducing the general and admiral positions in this meeting.",
      "Some officials have raised other theories, like whether he will roll out the National Defense Strategy, released every four years, which details the priorities for the department. This year's National Defense Strategy is expected to place a heavier emphasis than previous ones on defending the homeland with operations in U.S. Southern Command, like the recent strikes destroying boats of alleged drug smugglers, and in U.S. Northern Command at the southwest border.",
      "The meeting also comes as Congress remains deadlocked over funding the government, teeing up a potential government shutdown on Oct. 1. If the government shuts down, paychecks for military personnel will be delayed, although they will still be required to report for duty.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to Nicholas De Gregorio, an ally of Jack Ciattarelli, her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The disclosure potentially violates the Privacy Act of 1974 and exemptions established under the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The documents, which were also obtained by CBS News, appear to show that the National Personnel Records Center, a wing of the National Archives and Records Administration charged with maintaining personnel records for service members and civil servants of the U.S. government, released Sherrill's full military file \u2014 almost completely unredacted. CBS News discovered the egregious blunder while investigating whether Sherrill was involved in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal, in which more than 100 midshipmen were implicated in cheating on an exam. Sherrill was not accused of cheating and said her only involvement was not informing on her fellow classmates.",
      "The documents included Sherrill's Social Security number, which appears on almost every page, home addresses for her and her parents, life insurance information, Sherrill's performance evaluations and the nondisclosure agreement between her and the U.S. government to safeguard classified information.",
      "The only details redacted in the document are the Social Security numbers of her former superiors. The files appear to be the same ones Sherrill requested in August 2017 from the National Personnel Records Center, or NPRC, according to a signature verification page in the documents.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the NPRC told CBS News that a technician did not follow standard operating procedures for releasing records, and should only have released portions eligible under FOIA rules.",
      "\"The technician should NOT have released the entire record,\" Grace McCaffrey of the National Archives and Records Administration, said in an email to CBS News' questions.",
      "McCaffrey said the Archives became aware of the breach on Tuesday and immediately initiated a review of internal controls, including how and why the technician did not follow standard operating procedures. The National Personnel Records Center also alerted the agency's inspector general to the breach and said it contacted Sherrill's congressional office to apologize.",
      "Political campaigns, opposition research firms and news organizations often seek the military records of current or former service members running for elected office for both vetting purposes and to better inform voters. Military veterans and the next of kin of a deceased former member may request the full breadth of their military service records. The full file is only available to the general public 62 years after they finish their military service. When others request those records, only parts of the military file are released, and sections are redacted for privacy or national security reasons.",
      "During the tightening New Jersey governor's race \u2014 a new poll shows Sherrill and Ciattarelli tied \u2014 Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's military record, looking for information about the Naval Academy cheating scandal, in which over a hundred midshipmen were implicated in cheating on the final electrical engineering exam, a notoriously difficult course required for all third-year students who are not engineering majors.",
      "Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and as a midshipman received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a fellow classmate. However, she does not appear in a commencement program obtained by CBS News on May 25, 1994, the date of the Naval Academy graduation. The program was confirmed to be authentic by the U.S. Naval Academy.",
      "Sherrill does appear in the Naval Academy yearbook for 1994. The U.S. Naval Academy and Naval Personnel Command both told CBS News she graduated and was commissioned on May 25, 1994, which aligns with the date she entered active duty, according to her service records.",
      "When asked by CBS News why her name does not appear in the commencement program, Sherrill said in a statement: \"When I was an undergraduate at the Naval Academy[,] I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor.\"",
      "She added: \"That Jack Ciattarelli and the Trump administration are illegally weaponizing my records for political gain is a violation of anyone who has ever served our country. No veteran's record is safe.\"",
      "While Ciattarelli did not respond for comment on the release of her records, he posted on social media about Sherrill not walking at graduation. He called it \"stunning and deeply disturbing\" that she was implicated in the scandal, although Sherrill said she did not walk because she refused to report classmates.",
      "The White House referred the matter to the National Archives.",
      "De Gregorio, a Marine veteran who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for Congress in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"Given the charged political environment \u2026 Rep. Sherrill will no doubt seek to paint my actions as nefarious and the records as leaked by the Trump Administration to injure her, which as we both know is completely and totally false on both counts.\"",
      "De Gregorio told CBS News that Chris Russell, a Republican consultant in the state, had asked him to see what he could find on Sherrill.",
      "\"He [Russell] asked me if I could help him at all, and my first stop was, let me see what I can find from FOIA, and it was really the first time I'd ever done it,\" said De Gregorio.",
      "In May, De Gregorio, submitted a FOIA request to the NPRC for Sherrill's records. On June 11, De Gregorio received an email from the NPRC saying they had no records for a veteran named \"Sherill.\" The Archives had omitted the second \"r\" from Sherrill's last name.",
      "On June 12, De Gregorio told CBS News he called NPRC's customer service line, which routed him to a \"real, helpful person.\" CBS News has learned that the technician at NPRC accessed a system to retrieve Sherrill's Social Security number. And on June 30, her records were transmitted to De Gregorio, who said he gave the file to Ciattarelli's campaign but was surprised by what he received.",
      "\"When I saw [Sherrill's] Social (Security number), I was shocked,\" said De Gregorio. \"All of a sudden, the NPRC decides to give it to [me] a random guy. I made no bones like, I wasn't her, I wasn't a family member. There was no relationship there. And so I didn't know what to expect. So, I guess I'm a little shocked and kind of disgusted that the social was there.\"",
      "CBS News reviewed De Gregorio's request to the Archives and found it properly acknowledged that personal information and medical details would be redacted. The Archives told CBS News, \"We do not believe that there was any attempt to deceive NPRC staff in this case.\"",
      "De Gregorio later told CBS News that Ciattarelli's campaign did not hire or encourage him to access the files. Scott Levins, the NPRC director, on Monday sent a letter to De Gregorio admitting the Archives' \"serious error\" and said, \"I apologize for our mistake and ask that you please do NOT further disseminate the record that was sent to you in error.\"",
      "Sherrill's campaign was notified of the breach on Monday. In a letter to the congresswoman, NPRC apologized and said it was coordinating with the Navy, which is the legal custodian of the records. The records center also offered identity protection and free credit monitoring services.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that he supports a \"criminal investigation into the unauthorized and illegal release\" of Sherrill's records.\"It's outrageous that Donald Trump and his administration and political hacks connected to them continue to violate the law,\" Jeffries said. \"And they will be held accountable.\"",
      "Two years ago, Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Zach Nunn of Iowa were among 11 individuals whose records had been impacted by an unauthorized release from the Air Force Personnel Center Military Records Branch to a Democratic-aligned group. Politico reported Abraham Payton, of the research firm Due Diligence Group, had requested the records for the stated purpose of \"Benefits,\" \"Employment,\" and \"Other.\" Due Diligence was paid just over $110,000 by the House Democratic campaign, according to the Federal Election Commission records. The Air Force, in notifying Bacon of the breach, said Payton had requested the records \"inappropriately,\" and a House Judiciary subcommittee launched a probe in March 2023, but it is not clear whether it was completed.",
      "The unauthorized releases outraged Republicans in Congress. House Republicans attempted to stop the Defense Department from releasing summaries of the service records of current or former U.S. military members without the consent of the member, or if deceased, their next of kin, according to NBC News, but did not succeed.",
      "Journalists and veterans who investigate stolen valor claims said at the time the proposed legislation would effectively end independent examinations of individuals exaggerating their service record or violating the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, a federal law that makes it a crime to falsely claim to have received certain military decorations or awards with the intent of gaining a tangible benefit.",
      "Sherrill's political foes have also sought information about whether Sherrill had ever exaggerated her rank after leaving the Navy. Congressional records show she was selected for advancement to lieutenant commander in Sept. 2003. Records obtained through a FOIA request by CBS News and inquiries of the U.S. Naval Academy and Naval Personnel Command show Sherrill left the Navy at the rank of lieutenant in December 2003, before she received the promotion.",
      "CBS News found that in 2020, her campaign sent out political emails that incorrectly used the lieutenant commander rank. Also, former President Joe Biden referred to Sherrill as a \"lieutenant commander\" in his remarks in Oct. 2021 while touting his Build Back Better and infrastructure deal.",
      "But CBS News did not find any instances where Sherrill herself misrepresented her military rank.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Thursday sued six states for what it said was their refusal to turn over statewide voter registration lists sought by the attorney general.",
      "The suits were filed against the top election officials in California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania and allege the moves not to provide the voter registration rolls violate federal law.",
      "\"Clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"Every state has a responsibility to ensure that voter registration records are accurate, accessible and secure \u2014 states that don't fulfill that obligation will see this Department of Justice in court.\"",
      "The suits, filed in federal courts in each state, seek to force the elections officials to provide all voter information contained in their registration rolls, including names, birth dates, driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. The Justice Department claimed that failing to turn over the rolls prevents the attorney general from determining whether the states are following list maintenance requirements in a federal law known as the Help America Vote Act.",
      "It has already sued Oregon and Maine for failing to provide information on\u00a0 procedures for maintaining their voter lists and copies of statewide voter registration rolls.",
      "Bondi requested the information from states earlier this year to examine whether the states were complying with components of voting rights laws. But in some instances, the state officials expressed concern about handing over the voter registration lists and other information.",
      "California's secretary of state, for example, raised privacy protections to the Justice Department in response to its request for voter information. The top lawyer for Minnesota's secretary of state said that the department did not identify any legal basis that would entitle it to the state's voter registration roll, according to court filings. He also asked the Justice Department to provide information showing that the data would be protected and used properly before the state considered whether to share the list.",
      "New Hampshire's secretary of state told the Justice Department in an August letter that state law prevented him from disclosing its voter registration list, according to court papers.",
      "President Trump has for years railed against states' voting procedures, claiming without evidence that some state voter rolls are filled with dead voters or people in the U.S. illegally. He has repeatedly made false assertions that the 2020 election was rife with widespread fraud and rigged against him. His campaign brought dozens of lawsuits challenging the election results, and judges repeatedly rejected the election-fraud claims.",
      "After returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0aimed at overhauling U.S. elections. The directive mandates the Election Assistance Commission, a federal independent regulatory commission, to require documentary proof of citizenship in the standardized national voter registration form and mandates that states record information about the documents presented by voters.",

    "summary": "Afghanistan's Bagram Air Base is about 1,200 miles from an old Chinese nuclear test range, but controlling the base would require the reentry of U.S. personnel into Afghanistan.",
    "story": [
      "Ever since the chaotic American withdrawal from Afghanistan, President Trump has said it was a mistake for the U.S. military to leave Bagram Air Base, in part, because of its proximity to China. Lately, he's returned to that argument in proposing the base should again be under U.S. control.",
      "\"One of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\" Mr. Trump said in London this month, without offering details about how the U.S. would control it, now that the U.S. military is out of Afghanistan. In an interview with Fox News in late 2021, Mr. Trump also expressed concern that China would \"take over Bagram.\"",
      "China manufactures its nuclear weapons deeper within the country, according to nuclear experts, but there is an old nuclear test range at Lop Nur, about 1,200 miles from Bagram.",
      "Tong Zhao, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CBS News in an interview that the last explosive test at the Lop Nur range was conducted in 1996, but he also said there have been signs in recent years that China is continuing to maintain the range, and even expanding it.",
      "The U.S. government is closely watching China's nuclear weapons program, especially after the Pentagon recently projected China is on pace to rapidly expand its nuclear arsenal to over 1,000 warheads by 2030, up from the estimated low 200s in 2019.",
      "Lop Nur is located in Xinjiang province, which is also home to several missile and aircraft facilities, according to Zhao, who said it's where China develops advanced aircraft, missile systems, missile defense technologies and aerospace vehicles.",
      "\"Places in the northwestern part of China \u2014 that region is the location for many Chinese military testing sites and is responsible for the research and development of various cutting-edge military technologies,\" Zhao said. \"So, I think that it's a rich target for U.S. reconnaissance and surveillance.\"",
      "But current and former defense officials say there are other ways to monitor China that don't require a U.S. presence at Bagram. And unless there is a negotiated deal with the Taliban, it could require thousands of troops or more, one former defense official said.",
      "In London last week, the president suggested there could be negotiations, saying, \"That could be a little bit of breaking news, we're trying to get [Bagram] back because they [the Taliban] need things from us.\" But days later, the Taliban rejected any plan to hand Bagram over to the U.S.",
      "The chief Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid,\u00a0in a post on X\u00a0called on the U.S. to remember the\u00a02020 Doha agreement\u00a0\u2014 negotiated during the first Trump administration \u2014 in which the U.S. said it \"would refrain from the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence\" of Afghanistan and not intervene in its domestic affairs.",
      "That hasn't stopped President Trump from\u00a0threatening on social media\u00a0that \"BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN\" if Afghanistan does not give the base \"back\" to the U.S.",
      "Zalmay Khalilzad, the former U.S. envoy who negotiated the Doha agreement, has said that if other issues between the U.S. and the Taliban were resolved, the two sides could still agree on jointly using the base. \"In time, I would not rule out enhanced security cooperation, including the use of facilities such as Bagram, for joint counter-terrorism operations. But it will take persistence,\" Khalilzad\u00a0said in a post on X. The envoy recently met senior Taliban officials in Kabul, as part of a U.S. delegation to discuss prisoner exchanges.",
      "The base, originally built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, was occupied by the U.S. throughout the war in Afghanistan before the U.S. military\u00a0turned it over\u00a0to the Afghan National Army in July 2021. Just over a month later, the Taliban\u00a0took over\u00a0the country, including Bagram.",
      "Bill Roggio, who has researched Afghanistan for over 25 years and is the author of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' \"The Long War Journal,\" said in an email, \"The Taliban cannot be trusted, nor will the Taliban hand over Bagram to the U.S.\"",
      "\"The Taliban fought for 20 years to eject the United States, and it will not permit the U.S. to return,\" Roggio said.",

    "summary": "The U.S. economy's 3.8% growth from April through June represents a significant upgrade of the government's previous estimate.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, the government\u00a0reported Thursday in its final revision of gross domestic product data for April through June.",
      "U.S. GDP \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 rebounded in the spring from a 0.6% first-quarter drop caused by fallout from President Donald Trump's trade wars, the Commerce Department said. The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure.",
      "Consumer spending buoyed the economy in the second quarter, rising at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. The data provides evidence that Americans continued to open their wallets despite broader economic headwinds such as tariffs and a slowing job market, economists noted.",
      "\"That was a meaningful bump-up from the previous estimate of 3.3% thanks to the mighty consumer,\" Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO, said in a Thursday report. \"Today's run of data suggest that the economy \u2014 which strongly rebounded after the pandemic recession \u2014 continues to hold up well, even as we anticipate some slowdown ahead.\"",
      "Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government's previous estimate of 1.2%.",
      "The stronger-than-expected GDP data provides evidence that the economy remains on a solid footing, which may dampen the Federal Reserve's enthusiasm for additional rate cuts in 2025 and early 2026, economists noted. The central bank last week issued its first rate cut of 2025 when it reduced\u00a0its benchmark rate by one-quarter point, with the Fed penciling in two additional cuts in 2025.",
      "When announcing the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to a weakening labor market as prompting the move. Because rate reductions make it cheaper for businesses to borrow and expand, they can help bolster hiring and support the labor market.",
      "\"The Fed's September dot plot indicated that additional rate cuts are likely at their next two decisions in late October and December, but the case for back-to-back cuts is no slam dunk\" after today's GDP data, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in a Thursday email.",
      "Fed officials will be watching even more closely than unusual when their favorite inflation gauge \u2014 the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 comes out Friday.",
      "Rebound from first quarter",
      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports \u2014 which are subtracted from GDP \u2014 as businesses hurried to bring in foreign goods before Trump could impose sweeping taxes on them. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government's previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",
      "But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth.",
      "Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter.",
      "Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% \u2014 \"not great but much better than initially thought.''",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has added double-digit taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country and targeted specific products for tariffs, including steel, aluminum and autos. The president sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the U.S. and to help pay for the tax cuts he signed into law July 4.",
      "Thursday's GDP report was the Commerce Department's third and final look at second-quarter economic growth. It will release its initial estimate of July-September growth on Oct. 30.",
      "Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet currently expect GDP growth to slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% in the third quarter.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal prosecutors are nearing a decision about whether to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime foe of President Trump's, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News.",
      "It's unclear what alleged crimes Comey could be charged with, but multiple media outlets have reported that prosecutors have looked into charging him with lying to Congress when he testified in 2020 about the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The five-year statute of limitations for that runs out on Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors are considering presenting a case against Comey to a grand jury, sources told CBS News. In order to indict him, a majority of the grand jury would need to vote that there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed \u2014 a lower standard than the burden of proof needed to secure a criminal conviction.",
      "If Comey is charged, it would mark a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's push to punish the president's adversaries. Just four days ago, Mr. Trump penned a Truth Social post that appeared to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey, among others, calling them \"guilty as hell\" and writing, \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said Saturday he had fired the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia. A day earlier, the official, Erik Siebert, announced his resignation amid concerns from prosecutors in the office that he could be removed for refusing to charge another Trump political foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan, who has no prosecutorial experience, was sworn in as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on Monday.",
      "Comey and the president have sparred for years. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Comey oversaw investigations into alleged Russian election interference \u2014 including whether Russia sought to aid Mr. Trump's campaign \u2014 and into Hillary Clinton's private email server. The FBI's handling of both probes has drawn heavy scrutiny, and the Russia investigation, dubbed \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" has long outraged Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "Mr. Trump fired Comey months into his first term in 2017, and the two have slammed each other periodically ever since. Comey has called Mr. Trump \"morally unfit\" to be president and has accused Mr. Trump of demanding that Comey pledge his loyalty to him when he was FBI director. Mr. Trump has accused Comey of lying and suggested he should be jailed.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's return to office, he has continued to rail against the FBI and other agencies involved in the Russia probe. In recent months, the Justice Department has been investigating the handling of classified Russia-related materials by former senior FBI officials, and intelligence agencies have revisited their Russia investigations. In 2017, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 race and had a preference for Mr. Trump.",
      "The handling of the Comey probe has worried some legal experts.",
      "\"What is different about this case is that there clearly has been significant presidential pressure brought to bear,\" Tom Dupree, a George W. Bush-era Justice Department official, told CBS News. \"You don't want a universe in which that pressure distorts the prosecutorial judgment and makes prosecutors make charging decisions based not on the evidence, but on what they think will please the president.\"",

      "A federal judge ruled Wednesday it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to get some Federal Emergency Management Agency grants \u2014 a legal setback in the administration's push to revoke funding to \"sanctuary\" cities and states.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island ruled in favor of 20 mostly Democratic states that had sued FEMA, accusing the administration of \"holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage\" unless they assist immigration agents.",
      "The decision is likely to be appealed.",
      "The states that sued \u2014 which include California, New York and Illinois \u2014 took issue with a Department of Homeland Security document issued earlier this year that says recipients of DHS grants must \"honor requests for cooperation\" with immigration authorities, including requests to detain migrants or share information. Some of the plaintiffs are \"sanctuary\" states that have laws restricting cooperation between police and immigration agents.",
      "The states argued this move violates federal law and the Constitution, and could deprive them of billions per year in key disaster grants from FEMA, which is a sub-agency of DHS.",
      "The Trump administration has argued its policy doesn't violate the law. Also, months after the lawsuit was filed, the government told the court it had decided most of the FEMA disaster grants that the states were concerned about losing will not be tied to immigration cooperation after all. The administration called the lawsuit moot on those grounds.",
      "The states called the Trump administration's decision not to link disaster grants to immigration enforcement \"halfhearted and incomplete,\" arguing it's unclear if the decision was communicated to agency staff or if it will apply to years beyond 2025.",
      "In a 45-page ruling Wednesday, Smith sided with the states and granted summary judgment, calling the policy \"both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,\" Smith wrote.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James hailed the ruling in a statement, writing: \"The federal government cannot prioritize its cruel immigration agenda over Americans' safety. Today, the court affirmed that it is blatantly unconstitutional for DHS to hold life-saving disaster relief funds hostage to advance its anti-immigration efforts.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin asserted in a statement that cities and states that \"break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that,\" she wrote.",
      "The ruling follows a monthslong gambit by President Trump to punish \"sanctuary\" cities and states that limit cooperation between the police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The Trump administration argues that those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody. But \"sanctuary\" cities and states typically argue that requiring them to cooperate with ICE would undermine trust in local police and make some immigrants wary of reporting crimes.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to ensure that \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Since then, several agencies have moved to restrict grants to \"sanctuary\" cities and states, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Those moves have drawn lawsuits from Democratic cities and states. Last month, a San Francisco-based judge blocked the Trump administration from cutting off funding to almost three dozen cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston.",

In July, the U.S. lifted its terrorist designation of the rebel group he led.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the United Nations' headquarters drew President Trump's frustration.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump accused the United Nations of \"sabotage\" and demanded an investigation Wednesday after an escalator and teleprompter malfunctioned during his visit to U.N. headquarters \u2014 though the U.N. says a videographer from Mr. Trump's delegation may have triggered the escalator's safety shutoff.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump entered U.N. headquarters in New York City on Tuesday to address world leaders at this year's General Assembly session, they stepped onto an escalator. But the machine ground to a halt almost immediately, forcing both Trumps to start climbing the stairs on their own, videos of his arrival show.",
      "Later, as Mr. Trump began his speech to the General Assembly, he remarked that his teleprompter wasn't working. \"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" the president said, drawing laughs from the audience.",
      "The president brought up the two mishaps later in his speech, framing them as metaphors for what he views as the incompetence of the United Nations \u2014 which he accused of offering up little more than \"empty words.\"",
      "\"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen,\" the president said. \"These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump claimed the incidents were not a coincidence. He also leveled a third allegation that \"the sound was completely off\" during his speech.",
      "\"A REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday \u2014 Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!\" the president wrote. \"This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\"",
      "Mr. Trump pushed for an \"immediate investigation\" by the United Nations.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt floated a similar explanation on Tuesday, writing in a post on X: \"If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.\"",
      "Leavitt shared a screenshot from a Times of London article that reported U.N. workers had been overheard joking they might intentionally shut off escalators during Mr. Trump's visit and blame funding shortfalls. There is no evidence that U.N. staff followed through on those jokes.",
      "The press secretary later told Fox News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter, telling host Jesse Watters that \"it doesn't look like a coincidence to me.\" A federal law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News that the Secret Service is looking into the escalator issue.",
      "However, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday the escalator may have suddenly stopped because of a videographer from the U.S. delegation who can be seen walking ahead of the president and first lady on the escalator, seemingly to film their arrival.",
      "\"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator. The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above,\" St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in a statement.",
      "Separately, a U.N. official told CBS News that the White House operated the teleprompter for Mr. Trump when it malfunctioned during his speech.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment about the U.N.'s findings.",
      "Mr. Trump's speech came as his second administration distances itself from the U.N., withdrawing the U.S. from agencies like the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The administration has also cut its financial contributions to the U.N. and criticized its approach to Israel.",
      "\"The U.N. has such tremendous potential,\" the president said in his speech, \"but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many doctors and public health officials are taking issue with President Trump's claim that there's \"no downside\" to avoiding acetaminophen during pregnancy and his suggestion that expecting mothers should \"tough it out\" when it comes to fevers.",
      "Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications, is used to reduce pain and fever in pregnancy.",
      "\"Don't take it. There's no downside in not taking it,\" Mr. Trump said during an announcement Monday that linked the use of the drug during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children without giving new evidence and ignoring data that shows there is not a causal relation.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration is \"strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,\" he said. \"That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out, you can't do it. I guess there's that. It's a small number of cases, I think. But if you can't tough it out, if you can't do it, that's what you're going to have to do. You'll take a Tylenol.\"",
      "In an open letter to physicians released after Mr. Trump's announcement, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary was more cautious than the president, writing, \"clinicians should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers.\"",
      "But doctors worry the suggestion to \"tough it out\" will harm women and their babies, as high fever and pain can be dangerous during pregnancy.",
      "\"The messaging of 'tough it out' is something that unfortunately we have said to women in health care in this country for far too long,\" Dr. Lucky Sekhon, an OB/GYN and infertility specialist in New York City, told CBS News.",
      "There's also a concern patients may turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy. Makary noted in his letter that \"acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics.\" (Antipyretics are drugs that reduce fever.)",
      "In a statement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "\"Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives,\" the company said.",
      "The risks of fever during pregnancy",
      "Medical experts warn that fevers during pregnancy can cause problems for a developing baby.",
      "Especially in early pregnancy, fevers are associated with cardiac issues, cleft lip, cleft palate and central nervous system abnormalities, Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News after Mr. Trump's announcement.",
      "\"The idea that we're going to let someone with a fever 'tough it out' may have much worse implications for a pregnant woman than taking a dose of acetaminophen to bring that fever down,\" he said. \"I think that's not really an appropriate way to handle medical issues in pregnancy.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, echoed it's important to not let fevers go untreated due to the risk of brain development issues in the baby.",
      "\"Fever and infections during pregnancy can cause neurodevelopmental disorders including potentially autism,\" she said. \"I worry that this will scare women and that pregnant women may avoid Tylenol even when it's entirely appropriate, for example, to treat a fever.\"",
      "Internal medicine physician Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider said science does not support the administration's claims.",
      "\"What's far riskier is leaving a fever untreated during pregnancy which can harm both mom and baby, so Tylenol remains the safest option we have in those situations,\" she said.",
      "Why Tylenol or acetaminophen is advised",
      "Gounder said she's concerned that expectant mothers with a fever or pain may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "Fleischman agreed that acetaminophen is the safest option.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" he told CBS News. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "That research, he explained, includes a large study published last year\u00a0which analyzed data on 2.5 million pregnancies and found no increased risk of autism in children whose mothers took acetaminophen.",
      "The lead author of that study, Viktor H. Ahlqvist, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, said in an interview that acetaminophen continues to be \"the recommended option\" for use during pregnancy.",
      "He shared the concern that \"alternatives to acetaminophen in the U.S. might be other medications with less-safe profiles, such as opioids or other things to manage pain. We do know that these have serious consequences when used in pregnancy, both for the mom and for the baby.\"",
      "These doctors are not alone. Health experts from around the world have pushed back against the Trump administration's claims about acetaminophen and autism.",
      "The European Union's European Medicines Agency said Tuesday there is \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",
      "What should pregnant women do?",
      "Pregnant patients should consult with their doctor on what's the best for them, but Fleischman pointed out that acetaminophen is only used when necessary.",
      "\"You don't take Tylenol just for fun. \u2026 It's not like a [daily] vitamin, and we would never treat it that way,\" he said. \"Patients are told to use acetaminophen when they have a fever, when they have a headache or other pain symptoms in pregnancy which require treatment.\"",
      "The medication is generally recommended for a fever above 100.4, Fleischman explained.",
      "\"We know that higher fevers are definitely associated with more issues but if your temperature is above 100.4, taking acetaminophen to bring that down is definitely advised,\" he said.",
      "A single extra-strength dose, which is 500 mg, should be \"more than adequate,\" he added, but said it can be repeated if needed.",
      "\"As always, we want our patients to consult with their health care provider before using any medications, but all of the data shows that it's safe and there is no data that shows Tylenol causes autism,\" Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, told CBS News.",
      "She shared concerns over the FDA initiating a label change on Tylenol and acetaminophen to warn of a possible association with autism.",
      "\"I think it will make our moms scared to take Tylenol, and the repercussions, again, for those moms that are having fever and those moms that are having pain, those repercussions can be very detrimental. And it's really shameful when we know that Tylenol is safe and again we have no studies showing that it causes autism,\" Gillispie-Bell said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday declined to reinstate a group of internal watchdogs at eight federal agencies who were fired by President Trump earlier this year, but she wrote that the president broke the law when he ousted them without notifying Congress and providing justification for the removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes declined the officials' request for an order allowing them to return to their jobs as inspectors general unless Mr. Trump removes them in a way that complies with federal law. Reyes said the plaintiffs, eight former government watchdogs, failed to show that they had suffered irreparable harm as a result of their firings.",
      "She noted that even if the officials were reinstated to their roles, as they asked to be, Mr. Trump could remove them again after 30 days by providing notice and a rationale to Congress, requirements laid out in the Inspector General Act.",
      "\"The Court recognizes Plaintiffs' exceptional service as IGs, marked by decades of distinguished leadership across multiple administrations. They sacrificed much to take on the role of an IG and its many demands \u2014 no doubt including substantial time away from family and far larger paychecks available in the private sector,\" Reyes wrote in a 20-page decision. \"They deserved better from their government. They still do. Unfortunately, this Court cannot provide Plaintiffs more.\"",
      "Still, she said that Mr. Trump violated that law when he fired the internal agency watchdogs without telling Congress or laying out the reasons for the removals.",
      "\"President Trump violated the IGA. That much is obvious,\" Reyes wrote.",
      "The inspectors general who sued were among a group of 17 whom Mr. Trump fired en masse days after returning to the White House in January. They worked at the Small Business Administration and Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, State, and Veterans Affairs. Inspectors general are tasked with investigating wrongdoing and rooting out fraud and waste at government agency. They work independently from the agencies they oversee, and typically serve across Democratic and Republican administrations.",
      "The officials were informed of their firings through an email from the White House's Personnel Office, which stated that \"due to changing priorities,\" they were terminated from their respective positions \"effective immediately.\"",
      "But the removals failed to comply with federal law, which required the president to provide Congress with 30-day notice and \"case-specific reasons\" for removing an inspector general, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a letter to Mr. Trump.",
      "The senators asked the president to provide and required notice and information \"immediately.\" But Reyes noted in her decision there has not been a response.",
      "The inspectors general filed a lawsuit challenging the removals in mid-February, arguing that the president violated the Inspector General Act and acted outside of his authority by dismissing them without notifying Congress and providing a rationale. They asked the court to reinstate them to their positions and are seeking back pay.",
      "Since then, Mr. Trump has nominated new candidates to serve as inspectors general for five of the agencies, and the Senate confirmed one, at the Department of Veterans Affairs, last month.",
      "The firings are part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to reshape the federal government. He has fired numerous officials appointed by former President Joe Biden to serve at independent agencies, actions that have sparked legal battles.",

      "The discovery, which was revealed in a study published Thursday, was \"one of those rare but remarkable eureka moments,\" marine biologist Andrey Vedenin told AFP.",
      "The waters off Germany's coast are estimated to be littered with 1.6 million tons of unexploded munitions left behind from both world wars.",
      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter -- mostly marine worms -- living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",
      "\"Despite the potential negative effects of the toxic munition compounds, published underwater images show dense populations of algae, hydroids, mussels, and other epifauna on the munition objects, including mines, torpedo heads, bombs, and wooden crates,\" the study concludes.",
      "They also counted three species of fish, a crab, sea anemones, a jellyfish relative called hydroids and plenty of starfishes.",
      "While animals covered the hard casing of the bombs, they mostly avoided the yellow explosive material -- except for one instance.",
      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",

      "The explosive chemicals are highly toxic, but the animals appeared to have found a way to live near it.",
      "Other than the death-wish starfishes, they did not seem to be behaving strangely.",
      "\"The crabs were just sitting and picking something with their claws,\" Vedenin said.",
      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",

      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",
      "So when the Nazi bombs are eventually cleared from the bay, the researchers called for more stones -- or concrete structures -- to be put in place to continue supporting the sea life.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",

      "A cluster of space weather satellites blasted off Wednesday morning to cast fresh eyes on solar storms that can produce stunning auroras but also scramble communications and threaten astronauts in flight.",
      "The three satellites soared from Kennedy Space Center shortly after sunrise on the same SpaceX rocket. They aimed for a sun-orbiting lookout 1 million miles from Earth, each on its own separate mission.",
      "Altogether, the satellites from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, plus related costs, are worth about $1.6 billion. NASA's Joe Westlake calls it \"the ultimate cosmic carpool\" by sharing a rocket to save money.",
      "Heading the lineup is NASA's\u00a0Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, the first to be deployed. The mission \"will use 10 scientific instruments to chart a comprehensive picture of what's roiling in space, from high-energy particles originating at the Sun, to magnetic fields in interplanetary space, to remnants of exploded stars in interstellar space,\" said NASA in a description of IMAP.",
      "The probe will scrutinize the outer limits of the heliosphere, the protective, solar wind-driven bubble of gas around our solar system, according to the space agency.",
      "As a bonus, IMAP will also be capable of providing advance notice of solar storms \u2014 a valuable 30-minute heads-up \u2014 for astronauts exploring the moon under NASA's Artemis program. Officials expect the observatory to be fully operational by the time four astronauts fly around the moon and back next year.",
      "SpaceX shared video of Wednesday's launch in a social media post, which showed IMAP rocketing up from the ground at the Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.",

      "NASA is kicking in more than $879 million for its two missions, while NOAA's share is $693 million.",
      "While NASA already has a fleet of sun-observing spacecraft, science mission chief Nicky Fox said these newer missions offer more advanced instruments that will provide more sensitive measurements.",
      "\"Just being able to put all those together to give us a much, much better view of the sun,\" she said.",
      "The goal is to better understand the sun in order to better protect Earth, according to officials. As spectacular as they are, the northern and southern lights will not be the missions' focus.",
      "During a preview of NASA's upcoming Artemis mission around the moon, science officials said Tuesday that these new space weather missions will enhance forecasting and provide vital alerts if major solar activity strikes. If that happens, the four astronauts will take temporary shelter in a storage area under the capsule's floor to avoid the heightened radiation levels.",
      "The launch this week took place during a surprisingly active period for the sun, according to a recent study conducted by two NASA scientists, who noted that the uptick could affect space weather patterns as well as technology on Earth. Officials at NASA said each of its satellite missions will aim to better track those patterns, along with TRACERS twin satellites that SpaceX helped NASA launch several months ago to study how electrically-charge solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",

      "HSBC on Thursday announced it has successfully used quantum computing in a trial to optimize bond trading, making it the first in the world to prove the value of the powerful emerging technology in the financial services industry.",
      "Working with IBM, the bank used a combination of classical computing and the tech giant's Heron quantum processor to deliver a 34% improvement in algorithmic bond price predictions, HSBC said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0shared Tuesday.",
      "Philip Intallura, HSBC's group head of quantum technologies, called the trial a \"ground-breaking world-first.\" He expanded on the technology in a company video included in the announcement, saying the improvement in trade predictions ultimately means \"increased margins and greater liquidity.\"",
      "The trial was intended to test how quantum computers could optimize requests in over-the-counter markets, where financial assets are traded without a centralized exchange or broker serving as the intermediary. Using IBM's latest generation of quantum computers, the companies were able to estimate how likely a trade was to be a filled at a quoted price with far more accuracy than standard methods of using classical computers alone, according to the announcement.",
      "\"This is something that we do thousands of times a day already and that's estimating the likelihood of winning a trade,\" Josh Freeland, global head of algo credit trading at HSBC, said in the same video.",
      "Technology has long been intertwined in Wall Street trading. Automation systems used to assist traders were installed at the New York Stock Exchange in the\u00a01950s. Two decades later came the first rumblings of algorithmic trading \u2014 using computers programs to automatically execute trades. About two thirds of all trades were conducted using computers by 2009, Deutsche Bank research\u00a0shows.",
      "In its trial results, HSBC found that the addition of quantum computing techniques showed an improvement over classical computing alone in responding to the \"highly complex nature\" of factors involved in algorithmic trades.",
      "\"IBM Heron was able to augment classical computing workflows to better unravel hidden pricing signals in noisy market data than standard, classical-only approaches in use by HSBC, resulting in strong improvements in the bond trading process,\" HSBC said in its announcement.",

      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",
      "\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.",

The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",

      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful.

When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "summary": "Benjamin Elliott says he was sleepwalking when he stabbed his twin sister, Meghan. He insists he would never hurt her. Texas prosecutors disagreed even though they found no motive.",
    "story": [
      "In the early morning hours of Sept. 29, 2021, Benjamin Elliott, then 17 years old, walked into his twin sister Meghan's bedroom. It was something he had done hundreds of times. But on this morning, he had a knife in his hand and stabbed her in the neck while she was asleep. He would later say he was sleepwalking. When he realized what he had done, he immediately called 911.",
      "\"I just killed my sister,\" Benjamin told the emergency operator. \"Oh my God \u2026 I thought it was a dream.\"",
      "Benjamin's parents Kathy and Michael Elliott faced a heartbreaking and unimaginable reality: their beloved daughter, Meghan, was dead, and her adoring twin brother \u2014 their son \u2014 was accused of intentionally murdering her. They could not imagine why, and neither could investigators. Correspondent Erin Moriarty investigates the extraordinary case of \"The Boy Who Killed His Twin,\" for the 38th season premiere of \"48 Hours,\" airing Saturday, Sept. 27 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "\"What makes you so sure that you stabbed your sister while you were sleepwalking?\" Moriarty asked Benjamin Elliott in a jailhouse interview earlier this year.",
      "\"I would never have done that,\" he replied. \"I loved her. \u2026 She was my best and closest friend.\"",
      "Benjamin's family, relatives and closest friends agreed. \"He and Meghan are so close, you could never picture anything bad happening between them,\" Drue Whittecar, a longtime family friend of the Elliotts, told Moriarty.",
      "\"And how did she feel about Ben?\" Moriarty asked.",
      "\"She loved him,\" Whittecar replied. \"She looked up to him. \u2026 You would see her walk up next to him when she would feel uncomfortable and just kinda stand by him.\"",
      "Moriarty also interviewed the prosecutors, Megan Long and Maroun Koutani.",
      "\"Were you able to find any evidence that there was a problem with \u2026 these twins?\" Moriarty asked. \"No,\" Long replied. \"We definitely looked into it and tried.\"",
      "So how could such a seemingly loving relationship between the twins end in an unfathomable tragedy?",
      "That's what Benjamin's parents \u2014 Kathy, a senior manager with the Girl Scouts of America, and Michael, a stay-at-home dad \u2014 and their eldest daughter, Elizabeth, wanted to know.",
      "The Elliotts initially feared that a mental health crisis was the cause. But it turned out that Benjamin, and some close relatives of the Elliotts, had a history of sleepwalking. In fact, a boyhood friend of the Elliott twins told their parents about a slumber party years earlier, when they found Benjamin eating a donut on a couch \u2014 while he was asleep.",
      "Benjamin's defense attorneys, Cary Hart and Wes Rucker, asked Dr. Jerald Simmons, a neurologist and sleep disorder expert, to examine Benjamin. Simmons was initially skeptical. But after interviewing Benjamin, and hearing about his and his family's history of sleepwalking, Simmons conducted two sleep studies on him, with the teenager hooked up to devices that monitored his every movement. Simmons went from skeptic to believer.",
      "He determined that Benjamin fell quickly into what is known as slow-wave sleep, or when people can sleepwalk. That's important because on the night Meghan was killed, Benjamin spent hours scrolling the web on his cell phone, except for a 24-minute period when his phone was inactive. Simmons believes that Benjamin was sleepwalking during that period, and unintentionally stabbed Meghan to death.",
      "\"Do you believe Ben killed his sister without even realizing he was doing it in his sleep?\" Moriarty asked Simmons.",
      "\"Yes,\" he replied. \"Ben definitely killed his sister. He did it, there's no question, he's the one that had the knife and he stabbed her. But \u2026 he didn't do this voluntarily. There was no motivation.\"",
      "Surprisingly, sleepwalking has proved to be a successful \u2014 albeit rare \u2014 criminal defense. For example, a Canadian man, Kenneth Parks, was accused of driving 14 miles to his mother-in-law's home, where he killed her. He claimed he was sleepwalking the entire time and was acquitted. And North Carolina father Joseph Mitchell, accused of strangling one of his children, said he was sleepwalking during the killing. He was also found not guilty.",
      "The Elliotts were relieved, and frightened, at finally having an explanation. \"It's scary as hell,\" Kathy Elliott said, adding, \"if that can happen to us, then that could happen to anybody with a sleep problem.\"",
      "They hoped Simmons' findings would end the investigation into Benjamin. After all, prosecutors admitted they could find no reason for the fatal stabbing.",
      "But prosecutors were still not convinced. They questioned Benjamin's account of that night, his demeanor during an interrogation with a homicide detective and that he said he stabbed his sister once. That was important because the medical examiner determined Meghan had two wounds to her neck \u2014 and one was four inches deep and severed key arteries, which prosecutors believed should have left blood spatter at the scene.",
      "Despite receiving Simmons' findings, prosecutors charged Benjamin with intentionally murdering his twin, and earlier this year, Benjamin stood trial.",
      "The Elliotts had lost their daughter. No one knew why. Now, they faced losing their son.",

      "Hurricane Humberto, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters just north of the Caribbean. While forecasts as of Friday predict Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system developing nearby in the western Atlantic.",
      "That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called\u00a0the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center.",
      "How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as \"an intense dance\" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.",
      "In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.",
      "\"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it,\" Nolan said.",
      "Similar systems \"will dance around each other\" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: \"Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible.\"",
      "Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic, and then gained hurricane status early Friday morning. Forecasters expect it to move northwest over the next few days and strengthen along the way, the National Hurricane Center said. It's one of two systems in the region that could potentially impact parts of the southeastern United States, including coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina, according to Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center.",
      "Officials at the center said Wednesday that they were monitoring a second storm churning near Humberto over the northeastern Caribbean, which would likely become a tropical depression later in the week and a tropical storm, named Imelda, over the weekend. That system is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas \u2014 driving up the chances of storm surge, wind and rainfall striking coastal parts of the southeastern U.S.",
      "\"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead,\" said Nolan. However, because the developing system \"appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it,\" an interaction between the two \u2014 if one even takes place at all \u2014 may not result in a tangled gravitational \"dance.\"",

    "story": [
      "This story is part of a collaboration with The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "A federal health agency that has promised to scale back its animal research has drawn the attention of animal rights advocates who want to know why it quietly approved millions in new funding for dozens of primate experiments since President Trump took office.",
      "\"The NIH's rhetoric about reducing animal testing doesn't match reality,\" said Justin Goodman, senior vice president of White Coat Waste, an organization that has described the Trump Administration's commitment to drastically reduce animal testing as a \"watershed moment\" in its fight to end the practice.",
      "His group is highlighting the new spending to add pressure on National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya, one of several federal officials who promised that the agency will stop funding all but the most essential animal research and implement alternative testing methods. That decision \u2014 highly controversial in the world of medical research \u2014 comes at a moment when animal rights advocates have unprecedented leverage within the U.S. government through their close alliances with the president and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "NIH did not respond to requests for comment. In April, Bhattacharya said the initiative to steer projects to alternative tests \"marks a critical leap forward for science, public trust, and patient care.\"",
      "One of the new projects is a kidney transplant study that will use about 99 monkeys at a cost of about $10,000 each, bought from a South Carolina primate farm. That operation gained global attention last year when federally-owned research monkeys escaped into a rural town.",
      "Monkeys from Alpha Genesis will be used in new kidney research at the University of Pittsburgh that involves doing transplants in monkeys and euthanizing them at the study's conclusion. The project got $1.4 million in July from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The study is slated to receive $10.1 million through 2030, according to funding documents.",
      "The university said in a statement its researchers are \"grateful for the federal support and closely follow all regulations and industry standards, including continual evaluation of the suppliers of animal models that, at this time, remain necessary to our ability to achieve medical breakthroughs that save human lives.",
      "White Coat Waste has catalogued about $91 million in spending on animal research in recent months and provided details of the kidney project funding.The group has used Freedom of Information Act requests and spending documents to compile a list of more than 70 projects receiving money through the National Institutes of Health, despite promises to cut back on the funding.",
      "Animal rights groups have estimated that the federal government spends as much as $20 billion a year on research involving dogs, cats, monkeys and other animals. NIH is the biggest funder.",
      "Some controversial animal projects were cut from the budget as the Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk focused on wasteful spending. A joint investigation by CBS News and The Post and Courier found nearly $28 million in cancelled federal grants.",
      "Animal rights groups and some scientists have questioned the scientific value of animal experiments, which are often inconclusive. But patients rely on drugs and medical procedures under development for new treatments.",
      "Primates have been used for decades to test new medications and treatments before they move to clinical trials in humans.",
      "Alpha Genesis has regularly supplied monkeys for studies that hope to one day improve human tolerance for transplanted organs. But it came under criticism last year after the dramatic monkey escape and a regulatory lapse that led to the deaths of 22 research monkeys from apparent carbon monoxide poisoning. Whistleblowers inside the monkey farm reported the fatalities to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group, which alerted a federal animal protection agency. Greg Westergaard, the company president, did not respond to a message.",
      "White Coat Waste also discovered in March that NIAID would continue funding for the operations of Morgan Island, a remote barrier island popularly known as \"Monkey Island\" where the federal agency keeps up to 4,000 rhesus monkeys destined for research.",
      "U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, has called for a shutdown of the island, which is managed by Alpha Genesis, and recently inserted language into a House appropriations bill demanding that NIH explain its continued use.",

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks.\u00a0 And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?'\u00a0 \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama man convicted of killing a woman during a 1997 gas station robbery was put to death Thursday after apologizing to his victim's family and pleas from the woman's son to spare his life.",
      "Geoffrey Todd West, 50, was executed at William C. Holman Correctional Facility by nitrogen gas, a method Alabama began using last year. It was one of two executions of the night in the country, as Texas put to death a man convicted of killing his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter.",
      "West was convicted of capital murder in the 1997 killing of Margaret Parrish Berry, 33.",
      "West said \"No sir\" when asked by the warden if he had final words. Strapped to the gurney with a blue-rimmed gas mask covering his face, he gave a thumbs-up in the direction of his attorney as the execution began at about 5:56 p.m.",
      "West's eyes were open as he appeared to gulp and struggle for breath during the first two minutes. His head rocked from side to side, his left fist curled up, and he appeared to slightly foam at the mouth. At about 6:01, he began to take a long series of breaths with long pauses in between before becoming still at about 6:07. He was pronounced dead at 6:22.",
      "In a final statement provided by his attorney, West said: \"I have apologized privately to the family of Margaret Parrish Berry, and am humbled by the forgiveness her son, Will, has extended.\"",
      "He added that he was baptized in the Catholic Church this year and was \"at peace because I know where I am going.\"",
      "Berry, the mother of two sons, was shot in the back of the head while lying on the floor behind the counter at Harold's Chevron in Etowah County on March 28, 1997.",
      "Prosecutors said she was killed execution-style to ensure there was no witness. Court records state that $250 was taken from a cookie can that held the station's money. A jury voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence.",
      "West, in an interview last week, did not deny killing Margaret Berry. He said that at age 50, he struggles to understand what he did as a young man. He and his girlfriend were desperate for cash and went to the station, where he once worked, to rob it.",
      "\"There's not a day that goes by that I don't regret it and wish that I could take that back,\" West told AP by telephone. He said he wanted Berry's family to know he regrets what happened.",
      "Will Berry urged Alabama's governor to commute West's sentence to life in prison. He said taking another life will not help his family. He exchanged letters with West ahead of the execution.",
      "\"I forgive him and so does my dad. We don't want him to die,\" Will Berry said.",
      "He was 11 when his mother was killed, and he said prosecutors urged the family to support a death sentence. Now a father and grandfather, Will Berry said time and faith have given him a different perspective.",
      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a Sept. 11 letter to Berry that she intended to let the execution go forward. She wrote that she appreciates his belief but said it is her duty to uphold Alabama law.",
      "\"Almost 30 years ago, Margaret Parrish Berry went to work at the convenience store, but she would never get to return home. Geoffrey West went in with the intent to rob and kill, and he cowardly shot Ms. Berry in the back of the head,\" Ivey said in a statement issued after the execution.",
      "\"Tonight, the lawfully imposed death sentence has been carried out, justice has been served, and I pray for healing for all,\" the governor added.",
      "Also in a statement Thursday, Will Berry expressed astonishment at the execution and offered condolences to West's loved ones.",
      "\"From what we understand, he acted out of character that night. People he grew up with said he was a good person who got off track,\" Berry said. \"We pray that he gains peace when he meets his maker.\"",
      "Berry and West asked to meet ahead of the execution, but the Alabama Department of Corrections denied the request, citing security regulations.",
      "The Federal Defenders Office of the Middle District, which represented West, said in a statement that denying the meeting was a \"lost opportunity \u2014 for closure, for healing, for humanity.\"",
      "\"The execution of Mr. West demands that we reflect as a society: on how we handle capital punishment, on how age and life circumstances are considered, on how we balance justice, mercy, and the possibility of redemption,\" his attorneys said in a statement.",
      "The execution method used to put West to death involved strapping a gas mask to his face and forcing him to breathe pure nitrogen gas, depriving him of the oxygen needed to stay alive.",
      "Asked about West's movements during the execution. Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said he believes they were largely involuntary and things went \"just as expected, according to protocol.\"",
      "Alabama became the first state to carry out a nitrogen gas execution in 2024. Nationally, the method has now been used in seven executions: six times in Alabama and once in Louisiana.",

      "A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.",
      "\"This is a fair settlement,\" Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \"complicated.\" About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\"We have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",
      "The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a \"major step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.\"",
      "\"Anthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\" said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\"The decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we've consistently maintained, the court's landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\" said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \"marks a milestone in authors' fights against AI companies' theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors' rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\"",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \"back room\" dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",
      "Alsup's main concern centered on how the claims process will be handled in an effort to ensure everyone eligible knows about it so the authors don't \"get the shaft.\" He had set a Sept. 22 deadline for submitting a claims form for him to review before Thursday's hearing to review the settlement again.",
      "The judge had raised worries about two big groups connected to the case \u2014 the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers \u2014 working \"behind the scenes\" in ways that could pressure some authors to accept the settlement without fully understanding it.",
      "Attorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is \"consistent with due process\" and the court's guidance.",
      "Alsup had dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn't illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.",
      "Bestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.",
      "\"Together, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn't yours for the taking,\" she wrote.",
      "Alsup also said in the courtroom Thursday that he plans to step down from the bench by the end of the year. President Bill Clinton nominated him for the federal bench in 1999.",

      "Washington \u2014 Democratic leaders in Congress on Thursday dismissed the White House's recent threat that a government shutdown could spur large-scale layoffs of the federal workforce as \"intimidation,\" standing firm in their position ahead of the Oct. 1 funding deadline.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies on Wednesday telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for employees in programs, projects or activities that received discretionary funding. The RIF notices would come in addition to any furlough notices directing federal workers to stay home from work without pay if Congress fails to extend government funding by the deadline.",
      "Democrats in Congress framed the move as an intimidation tactic by the White House and OMB Director Russ Vought, and said they intend to barrel ahead with their push to secure wins on key health care priorities in exchange for keeping the government funded.",
      "\"We will not be intimidated by Russ Vought, who's completely and totally out of control,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference on Thursday.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shared a similar sentiment in a statement on Wednesday, calling the memo \"an attempt at intimidation.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one \u2014 not to govern, but to scare,\" Schumer said. \"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government.\"",
      "Democrats have repeatedly pushed for negotiations in the funding fight, looking to extract a more favorable outcome using one of their only points of leverage with Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Earlier this month, Democrats introduced a counteroffer to a GOP-led bill to keep the government funded that would also extend expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The House approved a Republican measure to extend funding for seven weeks. Both the GOP bill and the Democrats' proposal fell short in the Senate, leading to the current stalemate.",
      "After the House approved its bill, GOP leaders extended the lower chamber's break past the Oct. 1 deadline to fund the government, putting pressure on the Senate to approve their proposal. But Jeffries said on Thursday that the House-passed continuing resolution is \"dead on arrival\" in the Senate. He said it's \"unclear\" to him why House Republicans have left D.C. and have \"decided they don't even want to have a conversation with Democrats to reach a bipartisan agreement.\"",
      "\"Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" Jeffries said. \"If the government shuts down, it's because they want the government to shut down.\"",
      "Jeffries and Schumer had also pushed for a meeting with President Trump earlier this week. But Mr. Trump canceled the meeting, citing the Democrats' demands, saying \"no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.\"",
      "On Thursday, Jeffries said \"the Democratic position is clear: we will meet and sit down anytime, any place with anyone, including the president, who canceled the meeting because the Republicans have determined that they want to shut down the government and hurt the American people.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some could see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. As details on the deal trickled out from the administration last week, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China Committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Congress set clear legal safeguards for a deal, including precluding any cooperation with ByteDance or its affiliates on TikTok's recommendation algorithm, and prohibiting any ongoing operational relationship between a new TikTok and ByteDance,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"Based on initial reports, I am concerned the reported licensing deal may involve ongoing reliance by the new TikTok on a ByteDance algorithm and application that could allow continued CCP control or influence.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

The goal, according to a May memo, is to cut 20% of the four-star positions in the active-duty force and 20% of the generals in the National Guard.",
      "During his first few weeks on the job, Hegseth held a town hall at the Pentagon and promised to look into whether every four-star general or admiral is necessary.",
      "\"We won World War II with seven four-star generals,\" Hegseth said in February. \"Today, we have 44. Do all of those directly contribute to warfighting success? Maybe they do, I don't know, but it's worth reviewing to make sure they do.\"",
      "It's not clear whether Hegseth is expected to address reducing the general and admiral positions in this meeting.",
      "Some officials have raised other theories, like whether he will roll out the National Defense Strategy, released every four years, which details the priorities for the department. This year's National Defense Strategy is expected to place a heavier emphasis than previous ones on defending the homeland with operations in U.S. Southern Command, like the recent strikes destroying boats of alleged drug smugglers, and in U.S. Northern Command at the southwest border.",
      "The meeting also comes as Congress remains deadlocked over funding the government, teeing up a potential government shutdown on Oct. 1. If the government shuts down, paychecks for military personnel will be delayed, although they will still be required to report for duty.",

      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol on Thursday said the company is planning on closing underperforming locations, including those where the coffee chain is \"unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect,\" and will cut 900 jobs.",
      "The overhaul will cost $1 billion, according to a Thursday regulatory filing. Most of the costs are related to the store closures, such as $450 million in costs for breaking leases early. About $150 million will cover expenses for cutting the 900 employees, who Niccol said are \"nonretail\" workers.",
      "Niccol disclosed the plan in a letter to employees, but didn't specify how many locations would be shuttered. He did note that after adding some new locations over the last year, the company's overall store count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025.",
      "The company will end its current fiscal year with about 18,300 locations, he added. In its 2024 fiscal year, the company had 18,424 coffee shops.",
      "The overhaul comes as part of Niccol's \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, a strategy designed to revitalize its coffee shops and convince consumers to return to the stores. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales have slowed amid heightened competition from rivals such as Dunkin'.",
      "\"[W]e identified coffeehouses where we're unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed,\" Niccol wrote in the letter.",
      "\"Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations. This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers,\" he added.",

    "published": "Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The National Archives admitted a technician had erred in releasing Rep. Mikie Sherill's \"entire record.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to Nicholas De Gregorio, an ally of Jack Ciattarelli, her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The disclosure potentially violates the Privacy Act of 1974 and exemptions established under the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The documents, which were also obtained by CBS News, appear to show that the National Personnel Records Center, a wing of the National Archives and Records Administration charged with maintaining personnel records for service members and civil servants of the U.S. government, released Sherrill's full military file \u2014 almost completely unredacted. CBS News discovered the egregious blunder while investigating whether Sherrill was involved in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal, in which more than 100 midshipmen were implicated in cheating on an exam. Sherrill was not accused of cheating and said her only involvement was not informing on her fellow classmates.",
      "The documents included Sherrill's Social Security number, which appears on almost every page, home addresses for her and her parents, life insurance information, Sherrill's performance evaluations and the nondisclosure agreement between her and the U.S. government to safeguard classified information.",
      "The only details redacted in the document are the Social Security numbers of her former superiors. The files appear to be the same ones Sherrill requested in August 2017 from the National Personnel Records Center, or NPRC, according to a signature verification page in the documents.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the NPRC told CBS News that a technician did not follow standard operating procedures for releasing records, and should only have released portions eligible under FOIA rules.",
      "\"The technician should NOT have released the entire record,\" Grace McCaffrey of the National Archives and Records Administration, said in an email to CBS News' questions.",
      "McCaffrey said the Archives became aware of the breach on Tuesday and immediately initiated a review of internal controls, including how and why the technician did not follow standard operating procedures. The National Personnel Records Center also alerted the agency's inspector general to the breach and said it contacted Sherrill's congressional office to apologize.",
      "Political campaigns, opposition research firms and news organizations often seek the military records of current or former service members running for elected office for both vetting purposes and to better inform voters. Military veterans and the next of kin of a deceased former member may request the full breadth of their military service records. The full file is only available to the general public 62 years after they finish their military service. When others request those records, only parts of the military file are released, and sections are redacted for privacy or national security reasons.",
      "During the tightening New Jersey governor's race \u2014 a new poll shows Sherrill and Ciattarelli tied \u2014 Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's military record, looking for information about the Naval Academy cheating scandal, in which over a hundred midshipmen were implicated in cheating on the final electrical engineering exam, a notoriously difficult course required for all third-year students who are not engineering majors.",
      "Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and as a midshipman received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a fellow classmate. However, she does not appear in a commencement program obtained by CBS News on May 25, 1994, the date of the Naval Academy graduation. The program was confirmed to be authentic by the U.S. Naval Academy.",
      "Sherrill does appear in the Naval Academy yearbook for 1994. The U.S. Naval Academy and Naval Personnel Command both told CBS News she graduated and was commissioned on May 25, 1994, which aligns with the date she entered active duty, according to her service records.",
      "When asked by CBS News why her name does not appear in the commencement program, Sherrill said in a statement: \"When I was an undergraduate at the Naval Academy[,] I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor.\"",
      "She added: \"That Jack Ciattarelli and the Trump administration are illegally weaponizing my records for political gain is a violation of anyone who has ever served our country. No veteran's record is safe.\"",
      "While Ciattarelli did not respond for comment on the release of her records, he posted on social media about Sherrill not walking at graduation. He called it \"stunning and deeply disturbing\" that she was implicated in the scandal, although Sherrill said she did not walk because she refused to report classmates.",
      "The White House referred the matter to the National Archives.",
      "De Gregorio, a Marine veteran who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for Congress in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"Given the charged political environment \u2026 Rep. Sherrill will no doubt seek to paint my actions as nefarious and the records as leaked by the Trump Administration to injure her, which as we both know is completely and totally false on both counts.\"",
      "De Gregorio told CBS News that Chris Russell, a Republican consultant in the state, had asked him to see what he could find on Sherrill.",
      "\"He [Russell] asked me if I could help him at all, and my first stop was, let me see what I can find from FOIA, and it was really the first time I'd ever done it,\" said De Gregorio.",
      "In May, De Gregorio, submitted a FOIA request to the NPRC for Sherrill's records. On June 11, De Gregorio received an email from the NPRC saying they had no records for a veteran named \"Sherill.\" The Archives had omitted the second \"r\" from Sherrill's last name.",
      "On June 12, De Gregorio told CBS News he called NPRC's customer service line, which routed him to a \"real, helpful person.\" CBS News has learned that the technician at NPRC accessed a system to retrieve Sherrill's Social Security number. And on June 30, her records were transmitted to De Gregorio, who said he gave the file to Ciattarelli's campaign but was surprised by what he received.",
      "\"When I saw [Sherrill's] Social (Security number), I was shocked,\" said De Gregorio. \"All of a sudden, the NPRC decides to give it to [me] a random guy. I made no bones like, I wasn't her, I wasn't a family member. There was no relationship there. And so I didn't know what to expect. So, I guess I'm a little shocked and kind of disgusted that the social was there.\"",
      "CBS News reviewed De Gregorio's request to the Archives and found it properly acknowledged that personal information and medical details would be redacted. The Archives told CBS News, \"We do not believe that there was any attempt to deceive NPRC staff in this case.\"",
      "De Gregorio later told CBS News that Ciattarelli's campaign did not hire or encourage him to access the files. Scott Levins, the NPRC director, on Monday sent a letter to De Gregorio admitting the Archives' \"serious error\" and said, \"I apologize for our mistake and ask that you please do NOT further disseminate the record that was sent to you in error.\"",
      "Sherrill's campaign was notified of the breach on Monday. In a letter to the congresswoman, NPRC apologized and said it was coordinating with the Navy, which is the legal custodian of the records. The records center also offered identity protection and free credit monitoring services.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that he supports a \"criminal investigation into the unauthorized and illegal release\" of Sherrill's records.\"It's outrageous that Donald Trump and his administration and political hacks connected to them continue to violate the law,\" Jeffries said. \"And they will be held accountable.\"",
      "Two years ago, Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Zach Nunn of Iowa were among 11 individuals whose records had been impacted by an unauthorized release from the Air Force Personnel Center Military Records Branch to a Democratic-aligned group. Politico reported Abraham Payton, of the research firm Due Diligence Group, had requested the records for the stated purpose of \"Benefits,\" \"Employment,\" and \"Other.\" Due Diligence was paid just over $110,000 by the House Democratic campaign, according to the Federal Election Commission records. The Air Force, in notifying Bacon of the breach, said Payton had requested the records \"inappropriately,\" and a House Judiciary subcommittee launched a probe in March 2023, but it is not clear whether it was completed.",
      "The unauthorized releases outraged Republicans in Congress. House Republicans attempted to stop the Defense Department from releasing summaries of the service records of current or former U.S. military members without the consent of the member, or if deceased, their next of kin, according to NBC News, but did not succeed.",
      "Journalists and veterans who investigate stolen valor claims said at the time the proposed legislation would effectively end independent examinations of individuals exaggerating their service record or violating the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, a federal law that makes it a crime to falsely claim to have received certain military decorations or awards with the intent of gaining a tangible benefit.",
      "Sherrill's political foes have also sought information about whether Sherrill had ever exaggerated her rank after leaving the Navy. Congressional records show she was selected for advancement to lieutenant commander in Sept. 2003. Records obtained through a FOIA request by CBS News and inquiries of the U.S. Naval Academy and Naval Personnel Command show Sherrill left the Navy at the rank of lieutenant in December 2003, before she received the promotion.",
      "CBS News found that in 2020, her campaign sent out political emails that incorrectly used the lieutenant commander rank. Also, former President Joe Biden referred to Sherrill as a \"lieutenant commander\" in his remarks in Oct. 2021 while touting his Build Back Better and infrastructure deal.",
      "But CBS News did not find any instances where Sherrill herself misrepresented her military rank. Anthony Anderson, an Army veteran who is one of the country's most prominent \"stolen valor\" detectives, told CBS News that the rank issue did not rise to the level of her stealing valor either under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013 or how the term is used within the military community.",

      "The discovery, which was revealed in a study published Thursday, was \"one of those rare but remarkable eureka moments,\" marine biologist Andrey Vedenin told AFP.",
      "The waters off Germany's coast are estimated to be littered with 1.6 million tons of unexploded munitions left behind from both world wars.",
      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter -- mostly marine worms -- living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",
      "\"Despite the potential negative effects of the toxic munition compounds, published underwater images show dense populations of algae, hydroids, mussels, and other epifauna on the munition objects, including mines, torpedo heads, bombs, and wooden crates,\" the study concludes.",
      "They also counted three species of fish, a crab, sea anemones, a jellyfish relative called hydroids and plenty of starfishes.",
      "While animals covered the hard casing of the bombs, they mostly avoided the yellow explosive material -- except for one instance.",
      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",
      "Life on deadly weapons",
      "The explosive chemicals are highly toxic, but the animals appeared to have found a way to live near it.",
      "Other than the death-wish starfishes, they did not seem to be behaving strangely.",
      "\"The crabs were just sitting and picking something with their claws,\" Vedenin said.",
      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",

      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday he will not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank, an idea that has circulated among members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.",
      "\"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,\" the president told reporters during an Oval Office event. \"There's been enough. It's time to stop now.\"",
      "The president's comments come after several media outlets reported that Mr. Trump privately assured the leaders of Arab and majority-Muslim states this week that he would push back against any Israeli effort to annex the occupied territory.",
      "In recent days, several Western countries \u2014 including France, the United Kingdom and Canada \u2014 have moved to recognize a Palestinian state, leading Netanyahu to pledge some kind of response. Some hardline members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have pressed the Israeli government to react by annexing much of the West Bank, though it's unclear whether Netanyahu will seek to take that step.",
      "Netanyahu did not immediately publicly respond to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. Most proposals for an independent Palestinian state have involved Israel ceding control over the vast majority of the West Bank.",
      "If Israel annexed some or all of the West Bank, formally entrenching its control over the territory, it could make forming a Palestinian state virtually impossible. The move could also upset U.S.-allied Arab countries, some of which have sought to improve their relations with Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, calling the growing pressure on the issue an \"absurd prize for terrorism\" last weekend.",
      "Netanyahu's government has faced increasing international pressure over its handling of the Israel-Hamas war, which has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip's infrastructure and killed more than 60,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were militants or civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.",

    "story": [
      "When Maria Branyas Morera died last year\u00a0at 117 years and 168 days old, she was the oldest known person in the world. Before she died, she asked doctors to study her.",
      "Dr. Manel Esteller, chairman of Genetics at the University of Barcelona's School of Medicine, spent three years analyzing Branyas' health. A study, published online Wednesday, by Esteller and a cohort of colleagues found that a mix of factors contributed to Branyas' longevity.",
      "\"The conclusion is that the clues for extreme longevity are a mix between what we inherited from our parents and what we do in our lives,\" Esteller said. \"And this mix, the percentage depends, but it can be ... half and half.\"",
      "Branyas \"had very good genes that protect against many disorders, many genetic variants that nobody has seen before,\" Esteller said. She also had \"very good habits.\" She didn't smoke or drink alcohol, and had a diet rich in fish, olive oil and yogurt \u2014 eating three yogurts each day, according to Esteller.",
      "The yogurt was plain without added sugar, which replenishes the gut with good bacteria, helping to combat inflammation, Esteller said.",
      "Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of aging and disease, he said.",
      "\"These are good bacteria that provide an advantage to humans,\" Esteller added.",
      "The study noted that \"whether the dominance of the\u00a0Bifidobacterium [beneficial gut bacteria] related genus is fully attributable or not to the yogurt diet cannot be completely confirmed since that would have required a longitudinal study with sample collection over several years. However, we believe that it is likely that a beneficial effect of yogurt ingestion via modulation of the gut ecosystem could have contributed to her well-being and advanced age.\"",
      "Branyas once posted on social media about her love for yogurt, saying it \"gives life\" \u2014 and hers was a long one. She was born in 1907 in San Francisco and had lived in Spain since she was 8. She survived two world wars and two pandemics, and had three children and 13 great-grandchildren.",
      "In addition to living a long life, she also lived a healthy one \u2014 free of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, according to Esteller.",
      "The picture that emerges from studying Branyas \"shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level,\" the study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, says.",
      "Researchers said that to conduct the study, \"samples from the subject were obtained from four different sources: total peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and stool at different times.\"",
      "It also noted some limitations, including that aging and extreme longevity \"are probably highly individualized processes,\" so \"drawing broadly applicable conclusions from a single subject should be taken with caution.\""

      "At a press conference alongside Denmark's justice minister and police, Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen said that what he called a \"professional actor\" had been responsible for the drone incursions in that country.",
      "Poulsen said different types of drones had been spotted at various locations, including near critical infrastructure and military areas, and appeared to be part of a \"systematic\" attack carried out by a \"professional actor.\" He did not give further details on what he meant by that term, or who he may have been referring to, but added that \"there is still no direct military threat to Denmark.\"",

      "The national police said the drones followed similar patterns to others that halted flights for four hours at Copenhagen Airport earlier in the week, according to Reuters. After that incident, Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen Police said the those responsible seemed to be showing off their skills, adding that the number, large size and flight patterns of the unidentified drones combined indicated \"that it is a capable actor.

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0A Paris court on Thursday sentenced former French\u00a0President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in prison after finding him guilty of criminal conspiracy in an alleged scheme to finance his 2007 campaign with funds from Libya. In a surprise decision, the court ruled that Sarkozy will be incarcerated even if he appeals, but it also said the date of the sentencing would come later, sparing the 70-year-old the humiliation of being led from the courtroom in handcuffs.",
      "The court found Sarkozy guilty of criminal association in a plot from 2005 to 2007 to finance his campaign with funds from Libya, in exchange for diplomatic favors. It cleared him of three other charges, including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealment of the embezzlement of public funds.",
      "Sarkozy denounced the ruling and said he would appeal.",
      "\"This injustice is a scandal,\" he said.",
      "\"I ask the French people \u2014 whether they voted for me or not, whether they support me or not \u2014 to grasp what has just happened. Hatred truly knows no bounds,\" the former president said, adding that if he does end up behind bars, he'll do so, \"with my head held high.\"",
      "The court also found two of Sarkozy's closest associates when he was president \u2014 former government ministers Claude Gu\u00e9ant and Brice Hortefeux \u2014   guilty of criminal association, likewise acquitting them of some other charges.",
      "Overall, the ruling suggested that the court believed the men had conspired to seek Libyan funding for Sarkozy's 2007 campaign, but that judges weren't convinced the conservative leader himself was directly involved in the funding effort, or that any Libyan money ended up being used in his winning campaign.",
      "The chief judge, in an hours-long reading of the lengthy verdict, said Sarkozy had allowed his close associates to reach out to Libyan authorities, \"to obtain or try to obtain financial support in Libya for the purpose of securing campaign financing.\"",
      "The court said it couldn't determine with certainty that any Libyan money ended up financing Sarkozy's campaign.",
      "Sarkozy stood as the judge read out the verdict. He was accompanied by his wife, singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, in the courtroom, which was also filled with reporters and members of the public. Sarkozy sat in the front row of the defendant's section, and his three adult sons were also in the room.",
      "Sarkozy, who was elected in 2007 but lost a bid for reelection in 2012, denied all wrongdoing during a three-month trial earlier this year, which involved 11 co-defendants, including three former ministers.",
      "Despite multiple legal scandals that have clouded his presidential legacy, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in French right-wing politics\u00a0and in entertainment circles, by virtue of his marriage to Bruni-Sarkozy.",
      "The roots of a scandal",
      "The accusations against him go back to 2011, when a Libyan news agency and the country's former dictatorial leader\u00a0Muammar Qaddafi himself said the Libyan state had secretly funneled millions of euros into Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign.",
      "In 2012, French investigative outlet Mediapart published what it said was a Libyan intelligence memo referencing a 50 million-euro funding agreement. Sarkozy denounced the document as a forgery and sued for defamation. The court said Thursday that it \"now appears most likely that this document is a forgery.\"",
      "Investigators also looked into a series of trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy when he served as France's interior minister, from 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff.",
      "In 2016, Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told Mediapart that he had delivered suitcases filled with cash from Tripoli to the French Interior Ministry under Sarkozy. He later retracted his statement. That reversal is now the focus of a separate investigation into possible witness tampering.",
      "Both Sarkozy and his wife have been preliminarily charged with involvement in alleged efforts to pressure Takieddine. That case has not gone to trial yet.",
      "Takieddine, who was one of the co-defendants in the Sarkozy case, died Tuesday in Beirut at the age of 75. He fled to Lebanon in 2020 and did not attend the trial.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Sarkozy had knowingly benefited from what they described as a \"corruption pact\" with Qaddafi's government.",
      "Libya's longtime dictator was toppled and killed in an uprising in 2011, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.",
      "The trial shed light on France's back-channel talks with Libya in the 2000s, when Qaddafi  was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state.",
      "Sarkozy has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and reliant on forged evidence. During the trial, he denounced a \"plot\" that he said was staged by \"liars and crooks,\" including the \"Qaddafi  clan.\"",
      "He suggested that the allegations of illegal campaign financing were retaliation for his call as France's president for Qaddafi's \u00a0 removal. Sarkozy was one of the first Western leaders to push for military intervention in Libya in 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world.",
      "\"What credibility can be given to such statements marked by the seal of vengeance?\" Sarkozy asked in comments during the trial.",
      "In June, Sarkozy was stripped of his Legion of Honor medal, France's highest civilian award, after his conviction in a separate case.",

Al-Sharaa took power after ousting former Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad following nearly 14 years of civil war. In December, the U.S. removed a $10 million bounty off al-Sharaa's head.

      "The Global Sumud Flotilla said it was attacked during the night by \"unidentified drones and communications jamming.\" It said that \"at least 13 explosions\" were heard on and around several flotilla boats, while drones or aircraft dropped \"unidentified objects\" on at least 10 boats.",
      "No casualties were reported but there was damage to the vessels and \"widespread obstruction in communications,\" it added. Activists posted a brief video showing what appeared to be an explosion on or near one of the vessels.",
      "Greece's coast guard did not report any distress calls.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions regarding the attack.",
      "The flotilla, which organizers say includes about 50 vessels and participants from dozens of countries, is carrying humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, for Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry has accused organizers of being linked to Hamas, an accusation organizers reject. Israel has proposed that the activists unload their aid in the Israeli port of Ashkelon for it to be transported into Gaza, saying it will not accept any breach of its blockade.",
      "Italy condemned the attack and activated a navy frigate to be on hand for possible rescue operations, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said. Crosetto said the Italian Navy's frigate Fasan, which was sailing north of Crete, was \"already heading towards the area for possible rescue operations.\" Italy has informed Israel about the decision.",
      "\"In a democracy, demonstrations and forms of protest must also be protected when they are carried out in accordance with international law and without resorting to violence,\" Crosetto said.",
      "Italy's Foreign Ministry meanwhile said its computer systems had been overwhelmed by a \"mail bombing\" campaign in which thousands of what it said were fake emails flooded its servers after the attack on the flotilla.",

      "The flotilla has reported several attacks since it set sail from Spain on Sept. 1, including two while some of its boats were in Tunisian waters.",
      "Activists say it's the largest attempt to date to break the Israeli maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has now lasted 18 years, long predating the current war in Gaza. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics consider it collective punishment.",
      "The almost two-year war has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says around half were women and children.",
      "The world's leading authority on hunger crises said last month that Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive had already pushed Gaza City into famine. More than 300,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks as Israel has ordered the population to move south, but an estimated 700,000 remain, according to U.N. agencies and aid groups.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 others hostage. Israel says its operation in Gaza is aimed at pressuring Hamas to surrender and return the remaining 48 hostages, about 20 of whom Israel believes are still alive. Most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.",

    "summary": "Kremlin spokesman shoots back at Trump's suggestion that Russia is \"a paper tiger,\" declaring: \"There are no paper bears. And Russia is a real bear.\"",
    "story": [
      "Russia pushed back Wednesday at comments made by President Trump, who disparaged Moscow's military capabilities and economy and said Ukraine could potentially recapture all of the territory seized by Russian forces since President Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion over three years ago.",
      "It marked a dramatic shift in rhetoric for Mr. Trump, who has previously urged Ukraine to make concessions to end the conflict, but there was no indication that the president would also shift U.S. policy to offer more direct support for Kyiv.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday, shortly after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.",
      "\"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.\"",
      "\"President Trump heard about what is happening in Zelenskyy's version, and apparently, at that moment, this version became the reason for such an assessment,\" Peskov said in an interview with Russia's RBC radio Wednesday morning. \"We continue our special military operation in order to ensure our interests and achieve the goals that the supreme Commander-in-Chief Putin and the president of our country set in the very beginning.\"",
      "Peskov said Russia's \"premium markets\" were no longer in Europe, but in the East, and that the country was economically stable.",
      "\"Russia is associated with a bear. There are no paper bears. And Russia is a real bear\u2026 There is nothing paper here,\" Peskov said. \"Russia maintains macroeconomic stability. Yes, Russia is experiencing certain points of tension and problematic points in different sectors of the economy, which is inevitably connected with those myriads of economic restrictions, sanctions which we face, and so on, with the global economic disorder. This is not just sanctions. Let's not forget that the world has entered an absolutely unpredictable economic situation.\"",
      "Separately, in a briefing later on Wednesday, Peskov told journalists: \"The fact that they are trying in every way to encourage Ukraine to continue military operations, and the idea that Ukraine can recapture anything, is, in our view, a misguided proposition.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared Wednesday before the United Nations General Assembly, making a plea that \"we need to restore international cooperation for peace and security.\"",
      "\"People are still dying every week, yet there is no ceasefire, because Russia refuses,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "The U.S. is the most important contributor to NATO and the largest weapons supplier to Ukraine, but Mr. Trump wants America's European allies to take on more of the continent's defense burden - including supporting Ukraine. The president has, at times, echoed the Kremlin's narrative about the war, alarming NATO allies, and it was unclear whether U.S. policy on Ukraine would change after Mr. Trump's apparent rhetorical shift.",
      "\"He has acknowledged that the conflict is more complicated and he's clearly frustrated with Putin, so that I think it is perhaps a success for Ukrainian and European diplomacy that that explanation has got through,\" Neil Melvin, Director of International Security at the British think-tank RUSI, told the Reuters news agency. \"The narrative around what he is saying has shifted but he still seems to be making it about distancing the U.S. from leading on the conflict. He's putting it back onto Europe all the time.\"",
      "Melvin told Reuters that Mr. Trump's rhetoric could shift again.",
      "\"I think we are always just one call to Putin away from a shift, and that's why I think fundamentally the first eight months have eroded trust in Europe in the Trump administration's approach, and this doesn't restore trust,\" Melvin said.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's apparent shift on Ukraine, Peskov said the relationship between the U.S. and Russian leaders remained friendly.",
      "\"They have known each other for a very long time, and indeed they respect each other. They treat each other warmly,\" Peskov said. \"This does not prevent them from talking about sharp topics. It does not stop them from diverging on many issues. After all, each of them has his own interests.\"",

      "Anne Lenders, a curator at the city's landmark Rijksmuseum, said Tuesday that it was more or less by accident that she discovered that the barking dog in\u00a0Rembrandt van Rijn's famous \"The Night Watch\" is a near-identical copy of one that features in a 1619 pen and ink drawing by fellow Dutch artist Adriaen van de Venne.",
      "\"I wasn't looking for this; it was really unexpected,\" Lenders said in the glass room where \"Night Watch\" is undergoing extensive restoration.",
      "She was visiting an exhibition at the Zeeuws Museum in the southern Netherlands when her eye fell on a picture of a dog by Van de Venne that was printed in a book by the poet Jacob Cats. The original drawing \u2014 which turned out to be part of the Rijksmuseum's own vast collection \u2014 was also on display.",
      "Using her phone to compare the two images side by side, the 39-year-old Dutchwoman saw \"striking similarities\" between van de Venne's dog and the canine depicted in Rembrandt's 1642 masterpiece.",
      "\"The resemblance is so strong that at the very first moment I thought he (Rembrandt) must have used this,\" she added.",
      "That's when the research started: a comparison of Van de Venne's and Rembrandt's dogs; their pose, even the collar they wear.",
      "\"The head turns in exact the same angle with the mouth slightly opened. ... Both dogs have long hair and ears that hang vertical,\" said Lenders.",
      "In the \"Night Watch,\" the dog adds tension to a dark corner of the crowded composition, crouching and apparently barking near a drummer called Jacob Jorisz and just behind one of the iconic 1642 painting's main characters, Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch.",
      "The discovery is the latest in a series of revelations to emerge during a yearslong project to reexamine the 379.5 by 453.5-centimeter (149.4 by 178.5-inch) canvas using modern techniques. \"Operation Night Watch\" began in 2019 with an extensive study of the painting and is continuing with restoration work that is likely to take years to complete.",
      "\"'The Night Watch' is Rembrandt's most famous painting and we always think that it was created out of nothing, out of his genius,\" Taco Dibbits, the director of the Rijksmuseum, told Agence France-Presse. \"But Rembrandt, like the great Italian masters Michelangelo and Raphael, used works of art by artists before him to make his own compositions.\"",
      "One thing the Rijksmuseum couldn't figure out was exactly what kind of dog it is, with expert opinions divided between a French or a Dutch breed. Most likely, the two artists used a little poetic license.",
      "\"We will never have a conclusion on which breed it is,\" Dibbits said. \"But it's definitely very much loved.\"",
      "While Dibbits credited \"well informed luck\" for the find, he said such discovery could only have happened with the help of \"Operation Night Watch,\" a large-scale public restoration project launched in 2019.",
      "\"You would say, well, the painting is so famous, everything has already been discovered,\" he said. \"But of course you always with art discover new things and that's why Rembrandt is such a great artist.\"",

      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" President Trump said at a news conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the European Union's European Medicines Agency said there is currently \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current EU recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also commonly called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",
      "The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Tuesday, \"taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe.\"",
      "\"There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children,\" the agency's chief safety officer Dr. Alison Cave said in the statement.",
      "In a combined statement, Australia's chief medical officer and the country's medicine regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said they were joining \"other global medicines regulators, leading clinicians and scientists worldwide in rejecting claims regarding the use of paracetamol in pregnancy, and the subsequent risk of development of ADHD or autism in children.\"",
      "\"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\" the statement continued.",
      "While sharing a statement from Spain's Ministry of Health that stated paracetamol can be used during pregnancy, the country's minister of health, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, called out Mr. Trump specifically for misinformation and lack of evidence.",
      "\"Trump's new crusade is against paracetamol during pregnancy, ignoring all scientific evidence,\" she wrote on X. \"This denialism only sows alarm and misinformation. It's better to listen to health authorities than to the person who suggested injecting bleach against COVID,\" referring to a remark Mr. Trump made in 2020.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson said Tuesday that evidence of a link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism \"remains inconsistent,\" according to Reuters.",
      "International-based studies have been part of the evidence that shows acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe.",
      "In a\u00a0major study published last year, for example, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "In the U.S., organizations \u2014 including one that represents those who treat pregnant patients, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u2014 have countered the claimed link, saying there's \"no clear evidence.\"",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",
      "The discovery comes just a few months after\u00a0 scientists identified the Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, a new T. rex ancestor that researchers called the \"missing link\" between apex predators.",

      "Calle said the confrontation lasted about 40 minutes, during which inmates \"fired guns, threw bombs, grenades.\"",

In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",
      "Tip: Always insist on verified payment methods. If a buyer pushes you for a refund quickly, walk away.",
      "FAKE AGENT PHONE SCAMS ARE SPREADING FAST ACROSS THE US",
      "Scammers may try to recruit buyers into buying gift cards before a false check they provided bounces. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. The mystery shopper scam",
      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",
      "Tip: Only accept payments through secure online portals or in person with verified funds.",
      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",
      "This one lures jobseekers. The \"employer\" sends a large check to buy office equipment, then directs you to forward the extra funds to a vendor. Of course, the check is fake, and the supposed vendor is also the scammer.",
      "Tip: Legitimate employers provide equipment directly or reimburse verified expenses, not through overpayments.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Scammers target remote workers by promising to provide a stipend for work-from-home tech. (iStock)",
      "How to protect yourself from overpayment scams",
      "Now that you've seen how these scams play out, from fake dog sitting gigs to marketplace frauds and bogus job offers, it's clear they all follow the same playbook. Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

      "If you've spent time in a camper van, you know what to expect. You trade a little comfort for a lot of freedom, squeeze into tight corners and make peace with the idea that personal space is secondary to mobility.",
      "But every once in a while, a new model rolls onto the scene that flips that thinking on its head. Meet the Robeta Ananya. This isn't just a van: it's a \"glamper\" on wheels, and it makes other builds look like tin cans.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "A true living room, not just a chair",
      "Robeta makes it clear they really mean luxury. Instead of adding the typical swivel seat like most models, they built an actual, fully realized living room. There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",
      "Robeta Mobil is offering a luxury camping experience via its newest camper model, available in 2026. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",
      "VOLKSWAGEN\u2019S ICONIC CUTE VAN DRIVES ITSELF WITH 360-DEGREE VISION",
      "Robeta Mobil says that its Ananya model will offer a luxury experience on the road. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "A kitchen you'll actually use",
      "Over in the kitchen, things continue to impress. You get a Corian countertop, a proper two-burner gas stove, a grill and oven combo, and a roomy 130-liter fridge and freezer. This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",
      "Robeta Ananya price in the U.S. and how to buy one",
      "The Robeta Ananya is pure luxury on wheels, and its price reflects that. In the United States, the limited Founders' Edition starts at about $295,000. Only five of these exclusive models will be built, with deliveries starting in January 2026. If you want one, you'll need to act quickly. Robeta is taking U.S. orders directly through its website.",

      "Robeta Mobil says that it is only producing five Ananya vans for U.S. customers. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you've been holding off on van life because you don't want to sacrifice comfort, the Robeta Ananya changes the game. It delivers a real living room, a full kitchen and a bathroom that feels like it belongs in a home. You can wash clothes on the road, sleep in a proper bed and stay powered up for days without plugging in. This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",
      "Check out my top 5 best cellphone booster picks at\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Robeta Ananya proves that camper vans can be more than cramped compromises. With thoughtful design, smart use of space and luxury features, it invites you to travel farther and stay longer in comfort. Whether you want to roam the backroads or set up in scenic spots for days, this van makes it easy to do both in style.",

      "Social platforms are built for speed and visibility. Anyone can create an account in minutes, post content instantly and connect with strangers worldwide. This openness is what makes social media engaging, but it is also what makes it ripe for abuse. Fraudsters exploit the fact that posts, comments and messages are consumed quickly and often without much scrutiny.",

On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, scammers can buy credibility without earning it. Add in the algorithms that reward viral content and sudden spikes in engagement, and you get the perfect environment for fraud to spread unnoticed.",

      "How Wisconsin's solar battery park powers 130,000 homes",
      "The Paris Solar farm began producing power in December 2024 and generates 200 megawatts of renewable electricity during the day. That amount is enough to supply about 55,000 homes each year.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s first large-scale solar battery park combines solar power with storage, providing reliable clean energy day and night. (We Energies)",
      "Now, a 110-megawatt battery storage system has been added. These batteries capture excess energy from the solar panels and release it at night, during cloudy weather, or when demand suddenly rises. The battery system can power about 130,000 homes for up to four hours.",

      "Why Wisconsin's solar battery park is a historic energy shift",
      "Energy use is climbing, and nearly 79 percent of electricity in the United States still comes from fossil fuels. That dependence contributes to increased carbon pollution, higher costs and leaves the grid vulnerable during extreme conditions.",
      "The Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.",
      "Mike Hooper, president of project partner We Energies, called the project\u00a0\"historic\" and stressed that customers can count on dependable and affordable power in any weather.

      "What Wisconsin's solar battery park means for clean energy",
      "Battery storage is becoming a cornerstone of the clean energy movement. Without storage, solar power only helps while the sun is shining. With it, renewable energy becomes flexible, consistent and available around the clock.",
      "This shift benefits both the environment and consumers. Solar farms have been shown to cut electric bills by 5 to 20 percent. Additionally, the Paris Solar-Battery Park is eligible for federal tax credits, which can pass on savings to residents.",
      "Recent policy changes may reduce some of those incentives in the future. Even so, pairing solar with battery storage remains one of the most effective ways to lower costs and reduce emissions.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018The Cyberguy\u2019 Knutsson explains how to keep your Windows computer safe and security risks of online retail giant Temu.",
      "Earlier this year, Australian police arrested a passenger for running a malicious Wi-Fi network both at an airport and during a flight. The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",
      "An evil twin hotspot is a wireless network that impersonates a legitimate one by copying its name, also known as the SSID. When multiple networks with the same name exist, your phone or laptop often connects to the one with the stronger signal, which is usually the attacker's.",
      "Travelers check their phones while navigating delays and flight cancellations at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on July 19, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "Once connected, victims are often redirected to a fake login or landing page. In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",
      "QANTAS DATA BREACH EXPOSES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMER RECORDS",
      "How hackers trick you with fake in-flight Wi-Fi",
      "Here's how it worked in the Australian case. The attacker carried a portable hotspot onboard and named it to match the airline's official Wi-Fi network. Passengers, seeing the fake network with stronger signal strength, connected automatically. They were then taken to a counterfeit login page asking for personal details.",
      "A traveler awaits their delayed luggage after United Airlines grounded flights due to a tech outage at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, Aug. 6, 2025.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Ryan Murphy)",

      "YOUR DISCARDED LUGGAGE TAGS ARE WORTH MONEY TO SCAMMERS",
      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at CyberGuy.com.",

      "A VPN is important, but it isn't the only defense you should rely on. Here are some other ways to stay safe when connecting midair:",
      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if an attacker manages to steal your login credentials,\u00a02FA can stop them from getting into your accounts. Use app-based authenticators rather than SMS codes whenever possible, since they work offline and are harder to intercept.",
      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The rise of evil twin attacks in the air is a reminder that convenience often comes with hidden risks. As airlines push more passengers toward in-flight Wi-Fi, attackers are finding ways to exploit that dependency. Next time you fly, think twice before blindly connecting to the first Wi-Fi network that pops up. Sometimes, the safest choice is to stay offline until you land.",

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

    "summary": "Expert tips for buying refurbished electronics reveal what to check before purchase, including warranty policies and seller reputation.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",
      "Some sellers do a fantastic job restoring products, while others barely touch them before reselling. If you're considering refurbished tech, here are important lessons I wish I knew beforehand. These insights will help you make smarter choices, avoid headaches and get real value for your money.",

      "Researching a seller\u2019s track record is more important than chasing after the lowest refurbished price point. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",
      "SAVE UP TO 64% ON DYSON, DEWALT, ANKER, ADIDAS AND MORE DURING EBAY'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE",
      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",

      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "In the wake of the stabbing death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte, North Carolina light rail train, the state legislature introduced a bill to crack down on bail for violent offenders, drawing praise from one crime expert.",
      "\"You know, when you're talking about a response to a case like the murder of Iryna Zarutska in North Carolina, I think what you want to see first and foremost is that legislatures are going to be responsive to the public policy problems that have been revealed by such cases,\" said Rafael Mangual, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a member of the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "\"And so I think, before getting into the details, it's just important to acknowledge and express some appreciation for the responsiveness of the North Carolina legislature in this case,\" said Mangual.",
      "Iryna Zarutska curls up in fear as a man looms over her during a disturbing attack on a Charlotte, N.C. light rail train. (NewsNation via Charlotte Area Transit System)",
      "CHARLOTTE LIGHT-RAIL STABBING MURDER SPURS LANDMARK CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM FROM NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICANS",
      "North Carolina's House Bill 307, called \"Iryna's Law,\" broadens the term \"violent offense\" to include any felony crime where assaulting or using the threat of physical violence is an \"essential element of the offense.\" The bill then imposes strict bail guidelines for those who have previously been convicted of violent offenses, and even for first-time offenders.",
      "It also eliminates no-cash bail completely, and allows police and judges more discretion to involuntarily commit an offender if he or she is suspected of having mental health issues and violent tendencies.",
      "\"There is now going to be a rebuttable presumption of detention for at least some offenders who are charged with certain offenses. That is a good thing,\" said Mangual.",
      "The \"presumption of detention\" assumes that an alleged offender will be held in custody before trial, instead of assuming that they will be released on bail.",
      "Ukrainian Iryna Zarutska came to the U.S. to escape war but was stabbed to death in Charlotte on Friday.\u00a0 (Evgeniya Rush/GoFundMe)",
      "FELON INDICTED IN TRAIN MURDER AS ATTACKS TERRORIZE COMMUTERS IN BLUE CITY: REPORT",
      "\"What I would like to see in North Carolina's bill as it goes through the debate and deliberation process is for the presumption of detention to be extended, not just based on the offense category, but also on the nature of the criminal history, so that individuals who are on parole or probation or have a pending case will face that presumption, where individuals who have more than 10 priors, for example, will face the presumption as well.\"",
      "Zarutska was just 23 when she was stabbed to death on Aug. 22 by a homeless man named Decarlos Brown near Charlotte's uptown. Brown had a violent criminal past, including felony convictions and 14 prior run-ins with the law, and had previously been committed for mental health issues. He has now been charged with first-degree murder.",
      "Mangual told Fox News Digital that implementing harsher bail policies for previous convicts and allowing for easier involuntary commitment are important steps forward, but North Carolina and other states need more space to house inmates in order for the policies to be effective.",

      "LIBERAL MEDIA FUEL 'REPUBLICANS POUNCE' NARRATIVE AS CHARLOTTE STABBING OF UKRAINIAN REFUGEE SPARKS OUTCRY",
      "\"What we need to do is to make sure that our criminal justice systems are properly calibrated to identify those individuals, and that the mechanisms and systems are in place to take those individuals off the street and keep them there, so that we can all enjoy the safety that results from their absence in polite society,\" he said.",
      "Pointing back to the incarceration policies of the 1990s and 2000s, Mangual said that the United States knows how to keep violent offenders off the streets, which it had success doing during those decades.",
      "But, he said, left-wing activists lack the \"political will\" to restore order.",
      "\"The reason that we're not doing it so well anymore is that we've gotten to a place where we've allowed the activist class to convince policymakers that erecting those systems, and that the posture of those systems being so aggressive constituted a mass incarceration problem, [that] was feeding a kind of, you know, oppressive regime,\" he said.",
      "He recalled debating prison abolitionists at an event at the University of California \u2014 Berkeley Law School.",

      "CHARLOTTE TRAIN STABBING PUTS NORTH CAROLINA COMMUTERS ON EDGE AFTER RANDOM ATTACK",
      "\"My takeaway from that experience was that what's at the root of this isn't necessarily a desire to see crime increase, but what's really at the root of it is a very, almost unimaginable level of hubris,\" he said. \"These people who advocate for these policies advocate for them because they truly believe that crime is a function of things like socioeconomic inequality, poverty, unequal wealth distribution, unemployment and disinvestment in things like public education and other social safety net programs.\"",
      "Mangual doesn't subscribe to that school of thought, and noted that every society in human history has had inequality and poverty. While he does not think opponents of crime crackdowns are evil, he does think activists are out of touch.",

      "Body cam footage of Gazan boy, Abboud, 8, emerges alive after former GHF contractor Anthony Aguilar falsely claimed Israeli forces killed him outside a GHF site on May 28. (Credit: Gaza Humanitarian Foundation)",
      "A young Gazan boy dubbed \"Amir,\" who traveled to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution site and was reported as having been killed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in May, has been found alive hiding out with his mother.",
      "Both were safely extracted from the Gaza Strip earlier this month, though the location has not been disclosed for their security.",
      "The boy, whose full name was later discovered to be Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, nicknamed Abboud, and who is 8 years old but will turn 9 in October, appeared with his mother, Najlaa, at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 late last month in a heavy disguise to avoid detection, a GHF representative involved in the operation confirmed to Fox News Digital.",
      "An extensive internal operation by the GHF was launched to uncover the identity of the boy in late July after a former GHF employee, Anthony Aguilar, a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Army and retired Green Beret Lt. Col. turned alleged \"whistleblower,\" gave a series of explosive interviews in which he said a 10-year-old boy he called Amir had been killed by IDF forces after leaving a GHF aid site on May 28.",

      "In his account, Aguilar showed images taken using his cellphone of the boy approaching himself and another contractor clutching bags of food and barefoot.",
      "The former Green Beret turned GHF contractor for UG Solutions \u2014 a subcontractor of the GHF which received $30 million in U.S. government funding to support its \"critical work\" \u2014 described to multiple outlets an emotional encounter he had had with the Palestinian child, in which he claimed the boy had kissed his hand, touched Aguilar's face, and thanked him for the supplies of rice and lentils he had found.",
      "But the footage taken by Aguilar and handed over to GHF officials before it was obtained by Fox News Digital, did not show this interaction ever took place.",
      "The GHF contested Aguilar's account on several fronts and pointed out the hand the boy kissed was that of Aguilar's colleague standing to his left, which the footage also showed.",
      "Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden and his mother appeared at the GHF SDS 3 ending a weeks-long search for him on Aug. 23, 2025. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation)",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital why he said the boy engaged with him in this manner despite what the footage shows, he maintained his story and said, \"Amir kissed my right hand. He kissed my forehead, too. He thanked us and told us he was very hungry and thankful.\"",
      "In multiple interviews with various outlets, Aguilar described how the boy then returned to the group where other Palestinians were gathered at the distribution site before they were then dispersed by GHF contractors through the use of pepper spray, tear gas, stun grenades and bullets fired into the air, forcing them to flee the compound.",
      "However, Fox News Digital was told that the GHF did not yet have access to non-lethal arms in the early days of the operations, according to a GHF colleague who was aware of Aguilar's position at SDS 3 on May 28.",
      "Additionally, Aguilar claimed that once the Palestinian civilians had been pushed out of the SDS center, IDF forces then opened fire on the crowd and killed \"Amir,\" along with other Palestinians. He reiterated this claim in an interview late last month in which he had told Dialogue Works that the boy had received a \"shot to the torso, a shot to the leg \u2014 dead.\"",
      "But the GHF challenged Aguilar\u2019s story \u2014 including the location of where he claimed the event had occurred.",
      "In one of his first accounts of the incident on July 29 to Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Aguilar claimed the killing happened first outside GHF aid site SDS 1 before telling MSNBC on Aug. 2 that the shooting happened near SDS 2, and then telling Dialogue Works last month the events had occurred outside SDS 3.",
      "On Sept. 9, Chris Hayes gave an update on the report, telling viewers that the boy who was reported dead was, in fact, found to be alive. He said NBC producers had confirmed that the boy was now out of Gaza in an unnamed country.",
      "Multiple GHF sources confirmed that no such incident was reported at or outside SDS 1 or SDS 3, and SDS 2 was not yet even operational on May 28.",
      "Fox News Digital confirmed in speaking with multiple sources that Aguilar was on SDS 3 on May 28.",

      "In comments to Fox News Digital, Aguilar said, \"I sincerely, and with bated breath and joy, hope that Amir is alive. I\u2019ve always said as much. I have been in contact with his family and others, and Amir\u2019s family is not aware that he is alive, only that he is 'gone.'",
      "\"I have always said that due to GHF and IDF restrictions from UG S[olutions] personnel moving beyond the concentration camp style corals extending from the North entrance, that I was NOT, say again, NOT able to verify Amir\u2019s death,\" he said. \"But I did in fact see Palestinians gunned down by IDF machine gun fire at the intersection of the SDS 3 exit and the military corridor, north of SDS 3, where an IDF Merkava tank was located.\"",

      "Abboud\u2019s stepmother also later told the GHF that the boy hadn't gone missing until July 28, two months after Aguilar said he had been killed.",
      "Abboud ran away to be with his birth mother on July 28 amid a rift with his stepmother's family, whose custody he was put in following the death of his father, per Palestinian law.",
      "A GHF representative involved in the operation explained the search to find Abboud became not only a matter necessary to uncover what allegedly happened on May 28, but because there was increasing concern regarding threats posed by Hamas as traction picked up around the story.",
      "The official explained that Hamas had a vested interest in making sure this child was not found, as it would discredit Aguilar\u2019s story that a Palestinian boy had been gunned down by Israeli forces outside a GHF site.",
      "Ultimately, the GHF were able to locate the boy and his birth mother by speaking with local Palestinians and later, a family member who agreed to speak with the team before connecting them with Najlaa.",
      "ISRAEL, HAMAS TALKS DRAG AS AID GROUP CHAIR TELLS UN TO STOP ACTING LIKE THE \u2018MAFIA\u2019",
      "She then brought Abboud to the GHF site so that she, her son and four other male family members whose identities Fox News Digital has agreed to conceal, could be extracted from the Gaza Strip, after at least one of the male family members received direct threats from the Hamas terrorist network.",
      "In an interview shared with Fox News Digital, Najlaa is seen sitting with Abboud and another young male, who was also set to be extracted with them, speaking with GHF officials.",
      "In the video, which Fox News Digital did not post to protect multiple identities, Abboud refers to Najlaa as his \"mama\" and, according to a translation of the comments, he says he is happy to be with her while smiling and sitting next to her.",
      "The identities of Abboud, his mother and his relatives were verified by GHF using facial recognition software that compared the images of the boy with those captured by Aguilar.",
      "Facial recognition software, biometric data and the death certificate of Abboud\u2019s father were used by GHF to verify the family members' identities and relationships, and were also shared with Fox News Digital.",
      "Abboud also brought the shirt he was wearing in the footage taken by Aguilar, which is what the former GHF contractor said the boy was wearing when he was allegedly gunned down.",
      "Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, arrived with the T-shirt he was wearing on May 28, 2025, in the footage taken by Anthony Aguilar at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 on Aug. 23, 2025. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0)",
      "Aguilar did not respond to Fox News Digital regarding the intact shirt, and said, \"The new pictures are not Amir.\"",
      "When pressed on where specifically he thought there were discrepancies in the images of the boy, he said, \"Amir in my photos had a scar on his left clavicle. The boy featured by GHF does not. The Amir in my photos from SDS 3, does not have a scar on the right side of his forehead as the GHF\u2019s photos show.\"",
      "The GHF representative confirmed that the boy's scars were in fact used to verify his identity.",
      "\"I believe that is a boy of similar appearance,\" Aguilar said, noting he believes the outcome of the investigation \"is a lie.\"",
      "The GHF spokesperson for the organization, Chapin Fay, called Aguilar's story regarding the boy and his alleged murder by the IDF \"false\" during a press conference earlier this month.",
      "Aguilar told Fox News Digital that the GHF statements made against him during a July 29 press conference were \"libel and slanderous.\"",
      "Fay described him as a \"disgruntled former employee\" who was \"terminated for cause\" after he engaged in \"volatile conflicts with staff and erratic behavior.\"",
      "According to text messages shared with Fox News Digital, Aguilar also did not handle being removed from his role well, and threatened in a text exchange with a GHF official that he \"could be your best friend, or your worst nightmare\" if they didn\u2019t \"put [him] back to work.\"",

      "\"The dynamics on the front lines speak for themselves,\" Kremlin\u00a0spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Russia has made few to no major advances on the front lines since early 2024. Though some small advances have been achieved this year, the front lines have remained largely frozen for the last 18 months.",
      "Hoffman argued that if the U.S. wants to see Ukraine make advances, it needs to lift all strike restrictions it has in place and immediately enforce secondary sanctions, rather than wait on Europe to simultaneously follow suit, as they will take months to take a toll on Russia\u2019s war chest.",
      "Washington also should consider strong-arming NATO allies, including Germany to provide Ukraine with long-range strike missiles, and Denmark to close the Danish Strait to Russia\u2019s shadow fleet, as well as get Trump allies, like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, to stop buying Russian oil.",
      "While Hoffman argued there is more to be done before Putin actually starts to re-evaluate his war operations in Ukraine, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovil\u0117 \u0160akalien\u0117 said the president\u2019s position reversal was \"very encouraging.\"",
      "\"I completely agree with the statement that, definitely, Ukraine has a right and a chance, with our full support, to go back to regain its original borders, its internationally recognized borders,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Because why not?\"",
      "Sakaliene echoed Hoffman and said Ukraine needs the proper support to fully counter Russia, and without more U.S. and NATO support, not only will Ukraine be unable to make advances on the battlefield, Russia will continue to threaten NATO \u2014 increasing the risk of a massive international war.",

      "\"The only obstacle would be our fear \u2014 our inability to defend the rules of the world that we live in,\" she said. \"The recent series of incidents, both drone related in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and also related to the incursion into our air space by Russian fighter jets, demonstrate again and again that Russia is coloring outside the lines.",
      "\"It's going to continue [and] it's going to escalate, because they feel that they are unpunishable, because they feel that they are untouchable, and that means that they are happily challenging NATO as well,\" Sakaliene said.",
      "All three security experts agreed that the U.S.\u2019s role in countering Putin is \"critical\" and the argument that the U.S. should take a backseat to Europe weakens the united front necessary to stop Russia.",
      "\"The current world security architecture is built around the axis of the United States,\" Sakaliene said, arguing that the system shouldn\u2019t be exploited, but supported by Europe\u2019s bolstering of its own military capabilities. \"But that also means that the voice of the United States was and is still vital for certain decisions related to a security of a democratic world.\"",
      "\"And that the United States\u2019 voice is the one that Russia hears the loudest,\" she said.",
      "Trump on Tuesday suggested Ukraine should not only retake the land seized by Russia, but \"maybe even go further than that.\"",
      "Sak pushed back on this and said Ukraine is viewing the situation through a \"realistic\" lens.",
      "\"We've never had the ambition to conquer Russian territory. We don't need it,\" Sak said. \"We just want them out of our land.",
      "\"We understand that at this stage, even this objective is not possible to achieve through military means,\" he continued. \"It will have to be a mixture of diplomatic means, and it probably will take a long time.\"",
      "Ultimately, Ukraine viewed Trump\u2019s comments not as a signal that the U.S. is going to take immediate action, but rather as a \"confirmation\" that Trump is now fully on board with backing Ukraine, and aligning itself with the NATO alliance.",

      "\"Sooner or later, when we cripple their economy in a combination of sanctions plus the deep strike drones that we carry out on a daily basis, Russia will be in a position that, despite their willingness to fight this war and continue to cause these crimes of aggression, it will not just be able to do so purely for economic reasons,\" Sak added.",

      "Al-Sharaa, who led the Islamist rebel group Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over Assad, ditched his military fatigues for a Western-style suit and has been on a charm offensive, hosting European and Western diplomats and politicians in hopes of bringing Syria out from its international pariah status.",

      "Hall noted that al-Sharaa might be looking to secure a security pact between Israel and Syria along the UNGA sidelines, emphasizing that he seeks a Syria that is at peace with its neighbors and doesn't want to position Syria to be a threat to any outside forces, particularly Israel.",
      "He will also be looking to secure much-needed reconstruction aid to rebuild a country ravaged by 13 years of civil war. The cost for reconstruction is estimated to be between $250 and $400 billion, and 16.7 million people, or 75% of the population, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.",

      "ISLAMIST GROUP RUNNING SYRIA HAS MIXED RECORD OVER GOVERNANCE IN PROVINCE, RULED WITH 'IRON FIST'",
      "Al-Sharaa also fulfilled promises to target ISIS and other terrorist groups operating in Syria.

      "While optimism for a new Syria remains high, some caution it\u2019s still too soon to judge al-Sharaa as a Western ally given his terrorist past.",
      "\"Al-Sharaa is not a democrat. He ruled Idlib without power-sharing. So far, in terms of control of vital government functions like security, foreign affairs, intelligence and justice, he has put loyalists in place,\" former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital.",

      "Ambassador Barbara Leaf, who served as assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, visited Damascus and met with Shara in December, becoming the highest-ranking official to meet with Syrian leadership since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011.",
      "Leaf, a distinguished diplomatic fellow with the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital about her initial contact with Shara right after HTS overthrew Assad. Her mission was to get eyes on him, to assess him and to send a clear signal on U.S. expectations if he was going to lead a new Syria.",

      "Al-Sharaa made a point several times to say that Syria would no longer be a threat or a staging point for threats against its neighbors, including Israel, and that he would not allow the Iranians, Hezbollah or Palestinian groups, to use Syrian territory to conduct terrorist activities, the ambassador said.",
      "\"I came to the sense that he was already making a shift from being a military commander to being a politician, to being a political leader,\" Ambassador Leaf noted.",

Government security forces retaliated after forces loyal to the Assad regime launched an attack in the coastal city of Latakia, Assad\u2019s hometown. In total, around 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were massacred, according to the U.N.

In June, the Islamic State was suspected of carrying out a deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Syria, which killed 22 worshipers and injured 63 others.

      "The parents of a girl who remains missing after the flooding that hit Texas this summer said they were \u201cdevastated\u201d by Camp Mystic\u2019s plans to reopen next year.",
      "Cile Steward was among the 27 campers and counselors killed in July\u2019s catastrophic floods in Kerr County.",
      "\u201cOur families remain trapped in the deepest throes of grief, yet your communications treat our never-ending nightmare as little more than a brief pause before resuming business as usual,\u201d her parents, Cici and Will Steward, wrote in a letter Wednesday that was obtained by NBC News.",
      "In a letter to camp families Monday, Camp Mystic officials detailed plans to partially open next summer. It said the area of the camp along the Guadalupe River that was destroyed by the floodwaters will not reopen next year.",
      "\u201cAs we work to finalize plans, we will do so in a way that is mindful of those we have lost,\u201d the letter said.",
      "The camp also said it will build a memorial to those killed in the flooding.",
      "\u201cOur decision to partially reopen areas of the camp is informed by our faith and our commitment to continue the nearly century-long mission and ministry of Camp Mystic to provide a Christian camping experience for girls that allows them to grow physically, mentally and spiritually,\u201d the camp said in a statement Thursday.",
      "In their letter, the Stewards allege that the camp\u2019s owners did not consult them before deciding to partially reopen.",
      "\"Had you paused to reflect \u2026 you might have spared grieving families the additional anguish your decisions now cause,\" they wrote. \"Instead, your communications have only intensified our grief.\"",
      "The camp said Thursday that it notified the parents about the memorial because they \u201cwanted them to be informed\u201d and \u201cwelcome their participation as the process develops.\u201d",
      "Many of the parents who lost daughters have criticized the camp over its safety measures and preparedness and advocated for legislative change.",
      "\"Cile must be recovered, and you must fully confront and account for your role in the events and failures that caused the deaths of our daughters,\u201d the Stewards wrote. \"Anything less dishonors the children who were killed while in your care \u2014 at a time when their safety was your primary responsibility.\"",
      "This month, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation to strengthen camp safety, prohibiting cabins from being in dangerous parts of flood zones and requiring camp operators to develop detailed evacuation plans, among other things.",
      "Camp Mystic\u2019s letter to families said that its leaders are \"working with engineers and other experts to determine how we will implement the changes required\" under the newly passed bills."

      "Her most famous book, \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d has sold millions of copies, and the story of the tenacious Elizabeth Bennet and the brooding Mr. Darcy has become a fixture on school reading lists around the world, the inspiration for an almost endless stream of movie and television adaptations, not to mention podcasts and social media channels devoted to the work.",

      "Nate Bargatze is reflecting on his Emmys hosting duties and the donation bit that divided the internet.",
      "During his Sept. 23 \u201cNateland\u201d podcast episode, the comedian said that the Boys & Girls Club of America donation was \u201cfun\u201d but knows that some people didn\u2019t like the execution.",
      "In an attempt to keep acceptance speeches short during the Sept. 14 Emmy Awards, Bargatze said he would be donating $100,000 to the organization. However, every time a speech went over the allotted 45-seconds, money would be deducted. If they kept it short, money would be added.",
      "While it seemed good in theory, the show ended with the number in the red because the final speeches took up a lot of time.",
      "\u201cA lot of reviews did not like the Boys & Girls Club thing,\u201d Bargatze told his pals Brian Bates, Aaron Weber and Dusty Slay during the podcast, adding that the idea \u201ccame from a real place of heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody at home loved it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was fun, it was entertaining seeing money go down and all this.\u201d",
      "He said, he \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to put anyone on the spot\u201d or \u201ctrying to make someone donate money.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut in my head I kinda thought, \u2018Make it fun,\u2019\u201d he continued, noting that the children\u2019s presence or the donation wasn\u2019t \u201ca tool,\u201d he was just trying to find a way to make speeches shorter.",
      "\u201cHonestly, what I thought would happen in the room, I thought it was going to be Netflix donating or Apple. The shows that won,\u201d he said, not expecting 15-year-old \u201cAdolescence\u201d star and winner Owen Cooper covering what had been deducted for his speech going over.",
      "\u201cIn my head, I pictured it as they could then go long, but then be a hero,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was like a win-win. Then the night becomes about love and you\u2019re giving to these kids that are there and all this kind of stuff. I don\u2019t know if I just didn\u2019t explain it enough in the room.\u201d",
      "At the end of the night, CBS donated $100,000 and Bargatze put in his own $250,000, making the grand total $350,000.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna give that money at the end,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking I was gonna have to. But the way it went, I was like, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not gonna not.\u2019\u201d",
      "He said that this donation moment has been his biggest controversy, joking, \u201cIt is pretty funny my only controversial thing is the Boys and Girls Club got $350,000.\u201d",
      "Overall, Bargatze said he doesn't regret doing the bit, but would have just better explained the situation. He said he wanted it to be a \u201cgiving night\u201d and thanked his fans and friends for tuning in.",
      "He said that he knew he was the \u201coutsider,\u201d but that \u201cthe biggest thing that showed was that the ratings went up.\u201d",
      "According to Variety, the 2025 Emmys had 7.4 million viewers, an 8% increase from last year's 6.9 million viewers. The magazine reported that it was the most-watched Emmys since 2021."

      "Many fans have been hoping for years that the two work partners would become romantic partners.",
      "Taking things past friendship was never really an option for Benson and Stabler when they worked under Cragen, as they were paired up at work and Stabler had a wife at home. Despite Stabler separating from, and nearly divorcing, his wife, nothing romantic ever happened between him and Benson back then.",
      "Cragen was the one who broke the news to Benson in the show\u2019s 13th season that Stabler resigned and wasn\u2019t coming back. Ten years later, Stabler returned to Benson\u2019s life, and his wife died. Since then, the two have shared a few close moments, including a near-kiss in Benson\u2019s kitchen.",
      "Now, \u201clove you\u201d is not something these two casually say to each other. In fact, the only other time Stabler said \u201cI love you\u201d to Benson was during a PTSD spiral on \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime\u201d after his wife died from injuries sustained in a car bombing.",
      "At the time, his children and Benson staged an intervention for Stabler amid his erratic behavior following Kathy\u2019s death. Stabler pushed away their concerns, and Benson asked, \u201cElliot, tell us what you need.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, while staring at Benson as his kids watched.",
      "Benson looked shocked as his kids just stared. After a few seconds, he added, \u201cI love all of you.\u201d",
      "In a later season of \u201cOrganized Crime,\u201d Stabler drunkenly confessed to an old friend that there is a woman he is in love with. While he never shared her name, Benson really was the only person he could\u2019ve been talking about, since he hasn\u2019t seriously dated anyone since Kathy died. She also hasn\u2019t dated anyone since Stabler returned to her life.",
      "The closest Benson came to opening up about her feelings for Stabler was during a chat in Season 24 with friend Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) after they relaxed with wine for some girl talk during a case.",
      "Benson told Rollins she felt like Stabler was her \u201chome,\u201d but she couldn\u2019t move past how he left her and that he was always somebody else\u2019s husband.",

      "Benson\u2019s response in this week\u2019s episode after Stabler says \u201clove you\u201d is quite different from her reaction in that intervention scene. This time around, she seems calm, as if he says it to her on a regular basis.",
      "Hargitay shared a message in a recent interview for fans of a Benson-Stabler romance: \u201cYou can never give up hope.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think when people see two humans devoted and loyal and having each other\u2019s back, it\u2019s all any of us want \u2014 is that person that always has your back,\u201d she said."

      "The new season of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d picked up where last season\u2019s shocking ending left off \u2014 with trouble for Maroun (Odelya Halevi).",
      "Season 24 concluded in May with the murder of a man named Carter Mills, who was acquitted in the death of a model. Mills\u2019 DNA on the victim also happened to match evidence from an unsolved 12-year-old case: the murder of ADA Samantha Maroun\u2019s sister, Christina.",
      "After Mills was shot and killed following the acquittal, which came after EADA Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) didn\u2019t look the other way on a key piece of evidence, the police turned its focus to Maroun.",
      "Halevi tells TODAY.com she \u201cloved\u201d being a person of interest.",
      "\u201cI think at the end of the day, I love playing \u2014 finally playing or showing \u2014 a side of Maroun that is maybe a bit more dark and not all out there,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think that she\u2019s very opinionated and very emotional. And it\u2019s all out there. She doesn\u2019t hide it.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s the first time that we are seeing her really dark, really on the gray human side.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd concealing things, potentially,\u201d Dancy chimes in.",
      "Dancy and Halevi\u2019s characters butted heads over the case in last season\u2019s finale, and Price questioned Maroun\u2019s innocence. That mistrust is a theme that continues in the Season 25 premiere on Sept. 25.",
      "In last season's finale, their boss, District Attorney Nicholas Baxter (Tony Goldwyn), even used a personal story as an example during a conversation with Price about looking the other way on a piece of evidence in a case that may have cleared the suspect \u2014 trying to teach Price, a stickler for following the rules of law, that sometimes it\u2019s OK to be human in the job.",
      "Price later tells Baxter he researched the personal story and couldn\u2019t find any evidence it ever happened (more on this later).",
      "\u201cI had urged, as gently as I can, Nolan to not be so narrow in his view, to think with empathy,\u201d Goldwyn says about his character. \u201cAnd we\u2019re really seeing the consequences of his not doing that.\u201d",
      "Those consequences are a result of Price sticking to the law. That piece of evidence he turned over was also a personal betrayal to Maroun, as he had to report she tampered with the witness identification process in the case against Mills.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t help but judge Nolan for his rigidity, because the consequences are so stark,\u201d Goldwyn says. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting kind of wrinkle in our relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s surprisingly difficult to step outside of your own, from outside of your own perspective, and see anything a little bit differently. We all think that we\u2019re really open-minded, but actually, we\u2019re mostly blinking,\u201d Dancy says, as Halevi agrees.",
      "Dancy likes that \u201ceverybody gets nudged a little bit out of their comfort zone\u201d in the debut episode and is \u201cforced to look at the law from a slightly (different) angle.\u201d",

He overhears Maroun speaking to Mills\u2019 girlfriend, Julia, a lawyer who stood by his side through his trial and becomes the police\u2019s suspect in the shooting after Maroun is cleared. The girlfriend\u2019s legal team argues Julia killed her boyfriend in advance as an act of self-defense because \u201che was going to kill her that night\u201d and she \u201cdid what she had to do\u201d by killing him first.",
      "Julia later says Mills raped her, which leads Price to tell her and her lawyer they\u2019d accept a guilty plea for man 1, which is also a move Baxter asked Price about: Was he doing this to \u201cplacate\u201d Maroun after the Mills acquittal or because it\u2019s \u201cthe right legal move\u201d?",
      "When Maroun and Julia are left in a moment alone, Maroun says she feels \u201cterrible\u201d about everything and Julia acknowledges she knows what Mills did to Maroun\u2019s sister.",

That\u2019s why I waited outside his damn condo, so that I could \u2014\u201d Maroun tells her to stop talking as Price overhears them from outside the room.",
      "Maroun eventually tells Price what Julia said, aware that this would change everything about the case \u2014 just like Price choosing to turn over the evidence in the case against Mills led to an acquittal.",
      "In a scene mirroring his earlier conversation with Baxter, Price asks Maroun what she thinks they should do. Maroun says they could share what she overheard, or they could both pretend not to have heard what Julia said and \u201caccept the damn plea and move on.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust because we can win the case based on a letter of the law, doesn\u2019t mean we need to,\u201d she adds.",

      "Halevi says she believes her character \u201creally taps into\u201d Price\u2019s heart, which is a sentiment Dancy agrees with, and \u201cmakes him explore the law\u201d from a different angle.",
      "She also sees Maroun as \u201cthe extreme of empathy\u201d and Price as \u201cthe extreme of the letter of the law\u201d and that the two \u201cmeet in the middle.\u201d",
      "The case brings the legal team of Baxter, Price and Maroun together in a way, but also introduces a new sort of dynamic into the group.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s what happens in real life,\u201d Halevi says. \u201cYou build really strong relationships with the people that challenged the relationship. Then you get disappointed, and you are forced to build trust.\u201d",
      "Goldwyn points out the events of the Mills case created \u201cthis strange tension\u201d between Baxter and Price, that they \u201cboth kind of see the world quite differently.\u201d",
      "Dancy agrees, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a little less resolved between the two of us, because even going back to that story that he told me, which is supposedly a story about his own personal experience. So, it was kind of a human connection, turned out to be a fabrication.",
      "\u201cSo from my perspective, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wait, so you just made something up so that I would cut corners in order to win the case.\u2019\u201d",
      "Goldwyn interjects, \u201cYou don\u2019t know that it was a fabrication.\u201d",

      "Simone Kendle, a ring expert and CEO of Wove, tells TODAY.com Sulewski's ring appears to be a 6-to-7-carat elongated cushion-cut diamond, which leans into the vintage revival aesthetic trending in jewelry today.",
      "\"It whispers elegance and restraint,\" Kendle says. \"The design suggests that the wearer values timeless refinement rather than flamboyance. There\u2019s a quiet confidence in saying, 'I don\u2019t need extra frills; the center stone is enough.'\"",
      "Laura Taylor, a jeweler specializing in engagement and wedding rings at Lorel Diamonds, estimates the ring at 4 to 5 carats, set on a platinum band.",
      "\u201cCushion cuts are a timeless choice, known for their rounded corners and larger facets that make the stone flash in the light rather than sparkle,\" Taylor tells TODAY.com. \"They\u2019re often chosen by people who want something romantic and elegant but still with plenty of presence on the hand to capture attention.\"",
      "Without knowing the exact specifications of the ring, Kendle estimates the value to be between $200,000 to $300,000, while Taylor gives an estimate of $330,000 to $400,000.",
      "\u201cHowever, Finneas comes from a family who holds strong values around sustainability and ethics, which means it\u2019s very possible he chose a lab-grown diamond, which would bring the value closer to ($40,000 to $55,000),\u201d Taylor says.",
      "Sulewski, 29, said she met O'Connell, the brother of Billie Eilish who performs under the name Finneas, on Raya in September 2018.",
      "Sulewski discussed matching with Finneas on the celebrity dating app on \u201cThe Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast\u201d in 2020.",

      "In 2019, the pair bought a home together, and Finneas has dedicated songs to Sulewski, including his 2019 track, \"Claudia.\"",
      "Sulewski, who rose to fame with her beauty YouTube channel in the early 2010s and later founded body care brand Cyklar, told TODAY.com about her relationship with Finneas in 2023.",
      "\u201cFinneas is just so wonderful and one of, like, the most creative brains \u2014 so I feel lucky just to get to pick his brain whenever, and he does the same with me,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI feel really lucky to have a supportive partner that I really respect and that goes mutually both ways,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd so I couldn\u2019t ask for a better best friend to get to bounce ideas off of.\u201d",
      "Sulewski has also directed music videos for Finneas, including the visual for his track \"2001,\" which dropped in May 2025 and starred Kate Hudson alongside the singer."

      "The eight episodes of \u201cWayward\u201d focus on the small New England town of Tall Pines and a mysterious, cult-like institute called Tall Pines Academy.",
      "The Academy isn\u2019t really a school \u2014 it\u2019s a behavior modifying institute run by the charismatic Evelyn (Toni Collette) where wayward teens are sent for correction. But it\u2019s also about new local cop Alex (Martin, whose pronouns are they/them) and his pregnant wife Laura (Sarah Gadon), and how they discover and reveal the secrets of the Academy and the town itself.",
      "The fact that the series raises a lot of questions \u2014 and doesn\u2019t provide a pat ending, is a good sign, as Martin told TODAY.com. \u201cThe questions are more important than the answers, and the conversations we want to start about how we should help young people that are in crisis \u2026 and what we are doing that\u2019s not working and how do we reconcile our relationships with our parents,\u201d they said.",
      "But what happens in \u201cWayward\u201d \u2014 especially in those last few moments? Here\u2019s what we know!",
      "Warning: Spoilers for the entire season of \u201cWayward.\u201d",
      "What happens in \u2018Wayward\u2019?",
      "Several stories converge during the series\u2019 eight episodes. There are two best friends \u2014 Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind) and Abby (Sydney Topliffe), whose behavior and incipient drug use leads them to Tall Pines Academy. Leila is still reeling from the death of her sister, while Abby is more caught up in the whirlwind of her BFF\u2019s escapades and increasingly risky behavior.",
      "Meanwhile, Alex takes on a new position with the Tall Pines police department, arriving after a harrowing incident in his last job. Laura, who is expecting the couple\u2019s first child, spent many years in the small town and was drawn back during her pregnancy to familiar territory. But as is slowly revealed, being \u201cfrom\u201d Tall Pines seems to mean \u201cI was once incarcerated in the Academy where I was brainwashed into a strange concept of family and motherhood.\u201d Alex has no idea about any of this.",
      "Then there\u2019s Leanne, who rules over the Academy with a soothing tone and an iron fist \u2014 and has a watery basement where select individuals are encouraged to confront their demons by opening a \u201cdoor.\u201d Those who find a way to open the door are changed by the experience \u2014 and often mentally tied to Leanne, possibly forever. She\u2019s surrounded at the Academy by some of the teens she used to incarcerate there, and others now live in \u2014 and run \u2014 Tall Pines. And she\u2019s very, very interested in Laura and Alex\u2019s baby-to-be.",
      "After a teen escapes the institution, Alex starts digging into the real purpose of the Academy \u2014 and slowly uncovers Laura\u2019s association with it, both then and now. Leila and Abby risk everything to try and escape more than once, with Abby connecting with Alex for help, but only one of them manages to get away in the last minutes of the series.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at how brave it is to end each character the way that you chose to,\u201d Gadon told Martin while speaking with TODAY. \u201cYou could have taken a much easier route, but you didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "How does \u2018Wayward\u2019 end?",
      "In the final episode, what\u2019s been a reasonably spooky look at the underbelly of an institution and the weird graduates who now live in Tall Pines veers more deeply into the cult the Academy has created in town, and even some body horror.",
      "Several characters\u2019 endings go unresolved. Does Alex brain his partner on the force Dwayne (Brandon Jay McLaren) with a huge rock? What happens to Laura and Alex\u2019s baby? Was Leila responsible for her sister\u2019s death, or are those false memories Evelyn induces in her? Does Evelyn, whom Alex overdosed with her own drug, survive the watery basement? Does the Academy survive all this? What about the best friends, Leila and Abby?",
      "That last one is tied up with the show\u2019s final scenes, which revolve around Alex and Laura\u2019s baby\u2019s arrival. The girls do get out of the Academy, but the memories about her sister\u2019s death, and her role in it, lead Leila to apparently allow herself to be captured again. What\u2019ll happen to her now remains unclear. But Abby, who had arranged with Alex to use Alex\u2019s car to escape, makes it to the car.",
      "Meanwhile, Alex bursts in on the baby\u2019s birth at the last moment, which is being witnessed by several townspeople. When the baby is born, the little girl is almost immediately passed around the townspeople for skin-on-skin contact with everyone. See, this isn\u2019t just Alex and Laura\u2019s baby \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s everyone\u2019s,\u201d says an exhausted Laura.",
      "Is Alex on board with this cultish, weird world? Yes and no \u2014 because the show provides two endings. In one, Alex waits until Laura is asleep and takes the baby to where Abby is about to drive off with the car. The two leave together, escaping the clutches of Tall Pines.",
      "But wait! Not so fast. What we\u2019ve seen is \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 a possible future. Just as it seems that Alex, Abbie and the newborn are going to run off to a new, more sane world, the scene returns to Alex and Laura\u2019s home. We see Alex looking troubled and uncertain, but he walks to the open front door, and closes it rather than leave. Tall Pines has now acquired a new resident, it seems. But Abby, at least, does get away in the car \u2014 with Alex and Laura\u2019s dog Toast in tow.",
      "\u201cI like people who make bad choices,\u201d Martin told TODAY, \u201cbut I also relate to all of their choices.\u201d"

      "The \u201cLead From Behind\u201d PSA, unveiled on Thursday, Sept. 25, begins with a closeup of the former TODAY co-anchor wearing an open denim shirt that\u2019s off her shoulder as the lies on her side propped on pillows.",
      "\u201cSpeaking of genes, did you know that the majority of people who develop colon cancer are not genetically predisposed to the disease?\u201d she asks.",
      "As the camera pulls out for a wider shot, it shows Couric is actually lying on a hospital bed and wearing a hospital gown as healthcare workers prepare for a colonoscopy behind her.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why doctors recommend everyone 45 and older get checked. Mine are televised.\u201d",
      "A booming male voice then reads the message displayed in giant letters on the screen: \u201cKatie Couric gets regular screenings.\u201d",
      "The voice, font and style of the video are very similar to the \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d American Eagle controversial campaign from this summer.",
      "\u201cThat ad showed how pop culture and a pair of jeans could really shape the cultural conversation ... it was everywhere,\u201d Couric, 68, told People.",
      "\u201cIt was a moment in time, and we thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we ride that horse a little bit longer and have some fun with it?'\"",
      "TODAY got an exclusive first look at the PSA on Thursday, Sept. 25, as Couric marked 25 years since she became the first person in history to broadcast a colonoscopy on national television.",
      "Couric\u2019s husband, Jay Monahan, died in 1998 of colon cancer at the age of 42. She then underwent a colonoscopy on the air in 2000 to encourage other people to get the screening.",
      "\"After this happened to Jay, I felt really responsible and obligated to inform people and to let them know about a disease that nobody really wants to talk about,\" she said at the time.",
      "Screening rates jumped almost 20% in the years that followed, with doctors calling it the \"Couric effect.\"",
      "\"It's something that I'm really proud of,\" Couric told TODAY's Craig Melvin and Sheinelle Jones on Thursday. Craig's brother, Lawrence Meadows, died from colon cancer at 43 in 2020.",
      "\"Colon cancer can be prevented if it's detected early.\"",
      "She's also been urging people to know the symptoms and warning signs of colon cancer such as rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, narrow stools and iron-deficiency anemia.",
      "Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "As for the new PSA, Couric said she had a lot of fun doing it and hopes people can watch, laugh and talk about it, \"and then, most importantly, call their doctor and make an appointment to get screened.\"",
      "Couric accompanied Jimmy Kimmel when he underwent his screening in 2018. She and her second husband, John Molner, also got \"his and her colonoscopies,\" Couric said. \"It was very romantic.\""

      "Emma Watson shared where her relationship with J.K. Rowling, the author of the \"Harry Potter\" series, stands, nearly 25 years after the first film premiered in theaters.",
      "Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the film adaptations of the seven books, spoke about Rowling on the Sept. 24 episode of the \"On Purpose With Jay Shetty\" podcast.",
      "Shetty asked Watson what she thinks about some of Rowling's comments about her, including the author saying she would not forgive Watson for her views on trans rights, and that Rowling implied Watson, among other cast members, ruins films for her.",
      "\"I really don't believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, mean that I can't and don't treasure Jo and the person that I that I had personal experiences with,\" Watson said. \"I will never believe that one negates the other, and that my experience of that person I don't get to keep and cherish.\"",
      "Watson, 35, said she doesn't think \"these things are either-or.\"",
      "\"I think it's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with,\" she said. \"And I think that's a very, very important way for me that I need to be able to move through life ... I really do believe in having conversations and that those are really important.\"",
      "Watson added she thinks \"it's not so much about what we say or what we believe, but very often, how we say it that's really important,\" which she acknowledged can be frustrating when you're angry or upset with someone.",
      "\"I just see this world right now, where we seem to be giving permission for this kind of like throwing out of people, or that people are disposable,\" she said. \"I will always think that's wrong. I always \u2014 I just believe that no one's disposable, and everyone, as far as possible, whatever the conversation is, should and can be treated with, at the very least, dignity and respect.\"",
      "Watson also shared the fact that \"a conversation was never made possible,\" the thing she says has been most upsetting amid her rift with Rowling.",
      "Shetty asked if she would remain open to having dialogue with Rowling, and Watson said yes.",
      "\"Yeah, and I always will,\" she said. \"I believe in that completely. I just don't want to say anything that like continues to weaponize a really toxic debate and conversation, which is ... why I don't comment, or continue to comment, not because I don't care about her or about the issue, but because the way that the conversation is being had feels really painful to me.\"",
      "Watson said she appreciated Rowling's \"kindness, and words of encouragement and that steadfastness\" when she was acting in the films.",
      "\"Just as a young woman, for her to have written that character, created that world, given me an opportunity, which, to be honest, barely exists in the history of English literature \u2014 how can I \u2014 there's just no world in which I could ever cancel her out or cancel that out for anything. It has to remain true. It is true.\"",
      "Watson gestured holding two separate things in her hands as she described how she felt.",
      "\"This is where this, like, holding of these, I just don't know what else to do, other than hold these two seemingly incompatible things together at the same time, and just hope, maybe they will one day resolve or cojoin themselves, and maybe accept that they never will, but that they can both still be true,\" she said.",
      "\"And I can love her. I can know she loved me. I can be grateful to her. I can know the things that she said are true, and that can be this whole other thing,\" she continued. \"And my job feels like to just hold all of it, but the bigger thing is just, what she's done will never be taken away from me.\"",
      "A representative for Rowling told TODAY.com the author was not available for comment at this time.",
      "A rift began in recent years between the author and several \"Harry Potter\" cast members when Rowling started sharing what the LGBTQ+ community called anti-trans views on social media.",
      "Watson expressed support for the trans community in 2020, days after Rowling responded to backlash about some of her posts on X about sex and gender.",
      "\u201cTrans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren\u2019t who they say they are,\u201d Watson said in a post on X. \u201cI want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are.\u201d",
      "Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter in the films, also spoke out in an essay for The Trevor Project, a nonprofit that focuses on LGBTQ+ issues, in the days after Rowling's posts in 2020.",
      "\u201cTransgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I,\u201d Radcliffe wrote in the essay.",
      "In March 2025, Rowling responded to a post on X asking her which actors \"instantly ruins a movie\" for her.",
      "\"Three guesses,\" Rowling responded, seemingly taking a jab at Watson, Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, the three main \"Harry Potter\" leads.",
      "\"Sorry, but that was irresistible,\" she wrote, adding three laughing emoji."

      "The surprise order from the Trump administration imposing a new $100,000 fee on some visas set off a day of frantic travel as workers, companies and foreign governments scrambled to respond to Washington's latest immigration crackdown.",
      "By the time the White House clarified that existing holders of the H-1B visas for skilled workers were not affected, the chaos had already been sewn: U.S. allies expressed concern and their nationals abandoned holidays, business trips and plans to see their families as they raced back to America before the new rules took effect Sunday.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday signed the proclamation requiring companies to pay the fee to obtain the visas, which major tech companies rely on to fill high-skilled jobs.",
      "The order offered little clarity, however, about whether the steep new charge applied only to new applications or might also ensnare people seeking renewals and even those already holding valid visas.",
      "The ambiguity was enough to trigger a worst-case interpretation inside boardrooms and across living rooms from Bengaluru to London.",
      "India\u2019s government said the measure was likely to have \u201chumanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families,\u201d adding the \u201cfull implications of the measure\u201d were being studied.",
      "For a tense 24 hours, workers feared they could be locked out of the United States altogether.",
      "Tech companies and banks sent urgent memos advising employees not to leave the country. Bags were packed, tickets bought and families left behind as visa holders scrambled to beat what they believed was a looming deadline.",
      "Video verified by NBC News showed chaos and confusion on a flight from San Francisco to Dubai after Trump\u2019s announcement.",
      "The captain is heard citing \u201cunprecedented\u201d circumstances, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a number of passengers that do not wish to travel with us.\u201d",
      "The passenger who posted the video on Instagram said that a number of people chose to leave the aircraft and that he was stuck \u201cin the same spot for over three hours, waiting for the flight to depart.\u201d",
      "Microsoft, Amazon and Goldman Sachs were among the companies that sent urgent e-mails to H-1B holders with travel advisories.",
      "It was only on Saturday that officials sought to tamp down the turmoil, explaining that the $100,000 levy was a one-time charge, limited to new petitions, and that existing visa holders \u2014 including those overseas \u2014 would not be affected.",
      "\u201cThe Proclamation does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\u201d the White House rapid response account said on X, clarifying that the proclamation applies only to future applications.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had said Friday that companies would have to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B worker visas. But White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Saturday on X that it was not an annual fee, only a one-time fee that applied to each petition.",
      "But the scramble had already left its mark.",
      "Rohan Singh, a manufacturing engineer in North Carolina, canceled his plan to visit India, saying there was \u201cpanic among H-1B visa holders.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s ahead,\u201d he told the Reuters news agency.",
      "People on H-1B visas also shared their experiences of rushing back to the United States on the popular Chinese social media app Rednote, according to Reuters, in some cases shortly after having landed in other countries.",
      "On Friday, \"the prevailing interpretation\" was that people abroad needed to come back before the deadline, Grace Shie, an immigration lawyer at Mayer Brown, told NBC News.",
      "\"There was certainly that flurry, because for organizations big and small, they would have to get that message out, and the earlier the better,\" she said.",
      "India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.",
      "New Delhi and Washington are set to resume trade negotiations on the Trump administration\u2019s steep tariffs, but in a sign of how ties have strained, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked people in a public address Sunday to increase use of locally made products rather than foreign ones.",
      "South Korea, which is still reeling from a Sept. 4 raid by immigration authorities on a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, also said it was paying close attention to the change.",
      "\u201cWhen the government announces a major new policy potentially affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in an extremely concrete way,\u201c Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said on X. \u201cAT THE VERY LEAST it owes people precise information.\u201d",
      "Trump \"promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\u201d Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, told NBC News. \u201cIt also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\u201d",
      "The proclamation is a win for immigration hard-liners on Capitol Hill, but it is likely to rankle tech executives seeking qualified workers from abroad.",
      "Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple and Walmart are among the biggest users of visas under the program, which President George H.W. Bush signed into law in 1990.",
      "The fee had ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application.",

      "Microsoft has cut off some services to a unit in Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry after investigating allegations that it was using Microsoft cloud products for the mass surveillance of Palestinians.",
      "In a blog post published Thursday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the move came after reviewing an Aug. 6 report from The Guardian that said an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit had used the company\u2019s Azure storage service to collect and store recordings of Palestinian civilians\u2019 phone calls.",
      "Azure is Microsoft\u2019s primary cloud-computing service, with millions of monthly active users around the globe. However, the Guardian \u2014 citing interviews with 11 sources, including at Microsoft and among Israeli intelligence officials \u2014 alleged that the unit had access to \u201ca customised and segregated area\u201d within Azure\u2019s cloud platform.",
      "Smith did not directly corroborate that assertion but said the company\u2019s review had found evidence that \u201csupports elements of the Guardian\u2019s reporting,\u201d including the use of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and of certain artificial intelligence services. Smith did not provide additional details.",
      "Microsoft has since informed Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry, which oversees the IDF and its intelligence units, that it was disabling the unit\u2019s ability to use parts of Azure\u2019s cloud storage service. Microsoft did not name the unit it was targeting in its action, but The Guardian report was centered on Unit 8200, seen as Israel\u2019s equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency. NBC News has not confirmed that report.",
      "\u201cWe do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.\u201d",
      "Smith said Microsoft would continue other work designed to \u201cprotect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had no comment. In response to The Guardian\u2019s August report, an Israeli official first said its work with companies such as Microsoft was based on \u201clegally supervised agreements,\u201d but then later stated that \u201cMicrosoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.\u201d",
      "The Guardian article was the latest in a yearslong series of media reports alleging that the IDF has been using software products created by U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft, in its war in the Gaza Strip. The reports have led to internal protests by Microsoft employees, some of whom have subsequently been terminated, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. Late last month, Microsoft said it asked police to remove people it said had improperly entered its headquarters as part of a protest action.",
      "Microsoft has said it doesn\u2019t retaliate against employees who express their views but would respond to anyone deemed to have made threats.",
      "The reports about the use of Microsoft products by Israel\u2019s military have helped fuel a protest group, No Tech for Apartheid, created in 2021, aimed at pressuring Silicon Valley businesses to cut ties with Israel. The group includes a Microsoft-focused offshoot, No Azure for Apartheid, that has focused on the Redmond, Washington-based corporation.",
      "In a statement, a representative for No Azure for Apartheid celebrated the announcement, calling it \u201csignificant and unprecedented,\u201d but noting that \u201cMicrosoft has only disabled a small subset of services to only one unit in the Israeli military. The vast majority of Microsoft\u2019s contract with the Israeli military remains intact.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign in response to Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks \u2014 which it has said killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and led to some 251 hostages being taken \u2014 has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials."

      "ABOARD THE USS GERALD R. FORD, The North Sea \u2014 America\u2019s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, may be in an undisclosed location in the North Sea off the coast of Norway, but this week it is at the center of one of NATO\u2019s largest deployments.",
      "With a series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO countries\u2019 airspace setting off alarm bells throughout Europe, the nuclear-powered carrier has been launching squadron after squadron of fighter jets as part of a multinational operation known as Neptune Strike.",
      "Two NATO officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive operational matters, told NBC News that the jets were taking off for assignments somewhere in Eastern Europe, where tensions have been high after a spate of Russian incursions.",
      "Nerves jangled further on Wednesday when German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told his country\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag, that Russia continued to test the line and overflew a German warship in recent days.",
      "A German military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed to publicly discuss sensitive military matters, confirmed that Russian jets flew close to the frigate called Hamburg. He added that the ship, which is currently operating in the Baltic Sea, was taking part in Neptune Strike, among other things.",
      "The flyby came two days after NATO met to discuss Russia\u2019s recent violation of Estonian airspace with three MiG-31 fighter aircraft. The meeting was convened after Estonia requested consultations under Article 4, a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies.",
      "Earlier this month, there was also widespread anger after a number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace during an attack on Ukraine, where President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces have been at war for more than three and a half  years. A drone also reportedly entered Romanian airspace.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have been weighing a tougher response toward the Kremlin; NATO leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week condemned the Kremlin for a spate of \u201cescalatory\u201d incidents and vowed to defend the alliance.",
      "President Donald Trump also said Tuesday that NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft if they enter their airspace as he met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Pressed on whether the U.S. would back up NATO allies in such a situation, Trump said \u201cit depends on the circumstance.\u201d",
      "Heading to a summit with Putin in Alaska last month, Trump said he wanted a ceasefire. Since then, Moscow has expanded its drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, while seemingly ignoring his overtures for further dialogue to end the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, out at sea, the level of military cooperation seems unimpeded by political currents, as the Ford takes part in Neptune Strike. NATO has said it is not a military exercise, instead calling it an \u201cenhanced vigilance activity.\u201d",
      "On the Ford, it was all-systems-go as squadron after squadron of F-18 fighter jets took off and landed within minutes of each other. The pace on the flight deck was frenetic aboard the nuclear-powered ship, which weighs around 100,000 tons and has a crew of between 4,500 and 4,700.",
      "No ship in the U.S. fleet can launch more jets faster. The dramatic thump of the ship\u2019s four electromagnetic catapults which shoot them into the sky is constant and can be heard throughout the ship.",
      "\u201cSeveral of those aircraft are going a long distance to drop live weapons on a close air support range that is to the northeast of here,\u201d the Ford carrier strike group commander, Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, said after a squadron took off.",
      "The purpose of the \u201cactivity\u201d is to demonstrate large-scale coordination in multiple theaters, NATO says. It has been run several times a year since it started in 2020.",
      "Lanzilotta also stressed that this week\u2019s maneuvers were not a response to recent events in Eastern Europe, but had been planned long in advance. This is part of the core message that NATO intends to send, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in an action-reaction mode,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO, as you know, is a defensive alliance and that is what we are doing. We\u2019re proving that out and showing it in the way that we planned months ago.\u201d",
      "Protected by Navy F-18 and Dutch air force F-35 fighter jets overhead and French and other Allied ships nearby, as well as launching planes quickly, the Ford can also land them within minutes of clearing the runway.",
      "As they come in to land, the 20-ton jets hook onto a series of wires on the aft end of the deck, before they are quickly moved out of the way by tow trucks and other machinery as another one sets down.",
      "Teams in green, yellow and white vests scurry around orchestrating the operation, which can be extremely dangerous with so much hardware around.",
      "At a briefing, a model of a Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet hung behind Capt. David Dartez, commander of the Ford\u2019s air wing. Asked if that meant Russia was on their minds, he said they trained for any possible adversary.",
      "He also said he had conducted flights as far as Finland, which shares an 800-mile border with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fuel-dependent, but we have lots of friendly allies,\u201d he said, adding that he had refueled from a Finnish aircraft while on NATO maneuvers.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t say where I was, but he gave me gas because I was very far away from the aircraft carrier\u2026 at that moment, over 1,000 miles,\u201d he said."

      "Written and directed by Australian filmmaker Michael Shanks, the movie tells the story of a couple, played by American actors Alison Brie and Dave Franco, who move to the countryside to save their relationship and encounter a mysterious force that draws them closer.",
      "Hishow offered the first prerelease screenings in 11 Chinese cities starting Sept. 12, with the movie scheduled to be released nationwide on Sept. 19.",

      "The state-owned China Film Group Corp. said last week that the wide release of \u201cTogether\u201d had been postponed due to \u201ca change in the film\u2019s distribution plan,\u201d without offering further details.",

      "One of the biggest subjects of censorship is homosexuality, which despite being decriminalized in China has been the target of a government crackdown in recent years, even though surveys shows the public is increasingly supportive of LGBTQ people.",
      "In 2021, Chinese authorities banned \u201ceffeminate\u201d behavior from screens, and fans complained in 2022 when they noticed the removal of an LGBTQ storyline from the TV sitcom \u201cFriends,\u201d which is highly popular in China. At least 10 scenes with gay references were also dropped from the Chinese version of the 2018 biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d about the rock musician and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.",

      "The escalator escalation keeps escalating.",
      "President Donald Trump has demanded an investigation into what he called a \u201ctriple sabotage\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly, including his allegation that an escalator was deliberately halted while he and first lady Melania Trump were riding it.",
      "The U.N. says the escalator was likely stopped when a White House videographer accidentally triggered a safety mechanism. Nonetheless, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres' office said late Wednesday that it had ordered a \"thorough investigation\" into the three incidents mentioned by Trump, and was \"ready to cooperate in full transparency\" to find out what caused them.",
      "That came after Trump posted a 358-word complaint on Truth Social detailing \u201cthree very sinister events.\u201d",
      "Aside from the escalator issue, he saw malice in faults with his teleprompter and audio during his speech to the assembly, in which he had initially made light of the issues and told Western nations \u201cyour countries are going to hell\u201d over immigration.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey ought to be ashamed of themselves. I\u2019m sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary General, and I demand an immediate investigation.\u201d",
      "In what has become a fraught back-and-forth between the White House and the General Assembly, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric detailed the sequence of events that caused the escalator to halt.",
      "\"A readout of the machine's central processing unit indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism\" was \"triggered at the top of the escalator,\" likely by the White House videographer who had boarded before the president and first lady, Dujarric said. That safety mechanism \"is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing,\" he said.",
      "That did not appear to satisfy Trump, who described the escalator as coming to a \u201cscreeching halt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt stopped on a dime. It\u2019s amazing that Melania and I didn\u2019t fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.\u201d",
      "He referenced reporting in Britain\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper that had said that U.N. staff had been overheard joking about turning off the building\u2019s escalators and elevators to highlight a funding shortfall caused by White House cuts. This reporting has not been confirmed by NBC News.",

      "The pair have traded many barbed comments since Khan was elected to lead London in 2016 \u2014 Khan strongly criticized the president the same year for pledging a travel ban on a number of majority-Muslim countries, which was enacted in 2017. Trump called the Londoner and former member of Parliament \"a nasty person\" in a July news conference.",
      "\"I think people are wondering what it is about this Muslim mayor who leads a liberal, multicultural, progressive, successful city that means I appear to be living in Donald Trump's head, rent free,\" Khan said.",

      "\"I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it's been changed, it's been so changed,\" he said. \"Now they want to go to Sharia law. But you are in a different country, you can't do that.\"",
      "Initially, Khan's team at City Hall released a statement saying: \"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response.\"",
      "But Wednesday, speaking from the top deck of a London bus, Khan said he was thankful for the \"record numbers of Americans\" coming to live in London, which he said was the highest since records began. \"There must be a reason for that,\" he said.",
      "Khan's pointed criticism was in contrast to the approach taken by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Last week saw King Charles III and Starmer welcome Trump and first lady Melania Trump for a lavish state visit \u2014 an unprecedented second official trip to Britain for a sitting president.",
      "Particularly after Trump launched a global trade war, with tariffs impacting scores of close allies including the United Kingdom, very few world officials have seemed willing to so openly criticize the president or his policies.",
      "Asked whether Britain should be extending such friendship to Trump, Khan said: \"If you have a best friend, you should expect more from them \u2014 it's very different to an acquaintance or somebody who's a distant friend.\"",
      "While he said the U.K. and the U.S. have important economic and military ties, Khan said such a relationship should mean one side has the confidence to call out the other. \"I think that President Trump is wrong in many, many ways,\" he said.",
      "Davis Ingle, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement: \u201cMayor Khan clearly suffers from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome and has done a terrible job as mayor. His ridiculous open border and unchecked immigration policies have allowed violent crime to run rampant in his city.\u201d",
      "Khan, who represents Britain's Labour Party and is characterized as being on the center-left, social democratic wing of the party, won a third third term in office in 2024.",
      "The prevalence of Sharia law in the U.K. features in many right-wing conspiracy theories about the role of Muslims in the country, often partnered with the similarly false assertion that parts of big cities are dangerous \"no-go areas\" for non-Muslims.",
      "In reality, there are Sharia councils, which base decisions on traditional Muslim beliefs and religious texts, but they have no legal jurisdiction \u2014 as a government review found in 2018.",
      "Anger persists over the president's comments about London: Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour lawmaker who now represents Khan's old constituency in south London, has called for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. to be summoned over the remarks."

      "\u201cThe aerial assaults of [Israel] and the United States of America against Iran\u2019s cities, homes and infrastructure, precisely at a time when we were treading the path of diplomatic negotiations, constituted a grave betrayal of diplomacy and a subversion of efforts towards the establishment of stability and peace,\u201d he said.",
      "At the podium, Pezeshkian held up a book with the words \u201cKilled By Israel\u201d printed on the front and leafed through pages with pictures of families and children.",
      "There have been calls among moderates in Iran for direct talks with Trump, but on Tuesday Khamenei rejected negotiations with the U.S. about the country's nuclear program and in many ways set the parameters of what Pezeshkian could discuss in New York.",
      "\u201cIn my view, negotiating with America about the nuclear issue and maybe other issues is an absolute dead end,\u201d Khamenei said in an address, adding that Iran would not stop uranium enrichment because it would not be acceptable to the people of the country, according to his official website.",
      "He added, \u201cThis negotiation will be beneficial for the current American president. He will hold his head high, say I threatened Iran and I brought them to the negotiating table. He will be proud of this in the world. But for us it\u2019s an absolute loss and has no benefit.\u201d",
      "Khamenei also said on Tuesday that Iran does not intend to build a nuclear weapon, a point that Pezeshkian highlighted in his speech Wednesday, and that it will not negotiate on its ballistic missile program.",
      "But a White House official told NBC News on Wednesday that the U.S. is still open to talks with Iran. \u201cIran continues to defy its nuclear commitments. The United States is fully coordinated with our E3 partners and stands firm in holding Iran accountable,\u201d the official said. The E3 is a reference to Britain, France and Germany.",
      "The official added, \u201cAt the same time, the United States remains available for direct engagement with Iran \u2014 in furtherance of a peaceful, enduring resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.\u201d",
      "Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Wednesday that Iran is in a tough position and that the administration wants to negotiate with it, according to Reuters.",
      "\"We're talking to them,\" Witkoff said when asked if there is a diplomatic path forward with Iran.",
      "But the hard line drawn by Khamenei against talks with Trump about the nuclear issue could significantly ramp up tensions with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "The value of the Iranian rial against the U.S. dollar hit a record low Wednesday after Khamenei\u2019s remarks.",
      "Moderate voices in Iran pushing for direct talks with the U.S. were hoping to stave off more devastating attacks on the country by either the Israeli or U.S. military, which pummeled the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites in late June with airstrikes, including the first combat use of massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs.",
      "Trump, addressing the United Nations on Tuesday, said the attacks had targeted \u201cIran\u2019s key nuclear facility, totally obliterating everything.\u201d But analysts have raised questions about the extent of the damage caused by the attacks and the whereabouts of the approximately 880 pounds of enriched uranium that Iran is thought to have produced.",
      "The Israeli attacks, which Israeli officials said were intended to stop the Islamic Republic from obtaining a nuclear weapon, also hammered nuclear targets but expanded to include energy infrastructure and even the country's notorious Evin prison, and killed more than 1,000 people, according to state media.",
      "Even if Iran does not talk to the U.S. directly, Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, only have until Sep. 27 to negotiate a diplomatic solution with Britain, France and Germany before they face a \u201csnapback\u201d of sanctions. Negotiated under the 2015 nuclear deal, the snapback would lead to an arms embargo, freezing of assets outside the country and restrictions on enriching uranium, among other penalties.",
      "The sanctions could hit at a time when the country is reeling from an economic crisis, which critics blame on current sanctions as well as corruption and mismanagement.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron met with Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting in New York on Wednesday and posted on X that a diplomatic solution to avoid snapback could still be reached if Iran allows full access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, is transparent about its stockpile of enriched materials and resumes negotiations.",
      "\"An agreement remains possible. Only a few hours are left,\" Macron wrote. \"It is up to Iran to respond to the legitimate conditions we have set.\"",
      "After meeting with Macron, Pezeshkian also said that an agreement is possible in a post on X.",
      "\"If there is a commitment to fairness and what is right and ensuring the interests of both sides then a definite solution is within reach,\" he wrote.",
      "In recent months, Pezeshkian has been fighting for his political, and actual, life. He narrowly escaped an Israeli attack on a meeting of top officials in June, and his conservative critics have pressed him hard on the economy as well as restrictions on social freedoms.",
      "Security forces kicked off a massive crackdown during and after the war. The crackdown was ostensibly to ferret out spies, but in many cases the security forces used the war as a pretext to detain ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to Amnesty International. A police spokesman said in mid-August that 21,000 people had been arrested in the 12-day period of the war and observers say that more arrests have subsequently taken place and pending executions have been expedited.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re targeting already marginalized groups even further, and that\u2019s one way for them to exert and show the control that they have and try to retain their power while also instilling fear in the population,\u201d said Nassim Papayianni, an Iran campaigner at Amnesty International. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about scapegoating. So essentially they are trying to use the conflict as a way to ramp up the crackdown and the arrests.\u201d",
      "With Pezeshkian\u2019s hands tied on the international stage by the supreme leader and his hard-line opponents pressing a crackdown on real and perceived enemies at home, the Iranian president appears more isolated than at any point since assuming his position last year."

      "There are different ways to construe Trump\u2019s statement. One is that he\u2019s grown tired of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s persistence in shelling Ukraine and is prepared to step up coercive measures aimed at getting Russia to pull back.",
      "\u201cTrump concluded Putin is not interested in peace,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump confidant, said in an interview Wednesday. Calling Trump\u2019s post and his speech to the United Nations General Assembly a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d Graham added, \u201cThere was a belief in Moscow that Trump is on their side, but the president made it clear that Ukraine will have all it needs as long as it needs.\u201d"

      "Organizers of a flotilla carrying aid for Gaza have reported explosions near their boats and seeing multiple drones around the fleet, which is made up of more than 500 people, including prominent environmental activist Greta Thunberg.",
      "Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which was sailing near Greece early Wednesday, according its online tracker, also had its communications \u201cjammed,\u201d its organizers said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe are witnessing these psychological operations first-hand, right now, but we will not be intimidated,\u201d they added. \u201cSumud\u201d in Arabic means \u201csteadfastness\u201d or \u201csteadfast perseverance.\u201d",
      "\"The international waters felt like a battlefield,\" human rights activist Yasemin Acar, who is onboard the Alma vessel as part of the flotilla, told NBC News in a video call Wednesday, describing the overnight ordeal. \"There were bombs after bombs ... and no one came to help.\"",
      "In an online video GSF shared overnight, a bright light can be seen piercing the darkness, before a loud blast rings out. Organizers said that the video was recorded from one of its boats, Spectre, and that it captured one of the explosions heard by crew members.",
      "In a separate video posted by Acar, music from the pop group ABBA, whose members, like Thunberg, hail from Sweden, can be heard ringing out.",
      "\"They started jamming our comms by playing ABBA songs, you know, to interfere with our radio,\" Acar said, adding that the crew \"couldn't even reach the Coast Guard\" because of the apparent interference.",
      "\u201cIt was horrific that this can happen in international waters, close to Greece. I mean, in Europe,\" she said.",
      "Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto condemned the incident Wednesday, saying he had directed a navy ship to offer assistance, Reuters reported. Acar confirmed Italy had offered assistance and was expected to \"safeguard\" the flotilla during at least part of its journey.",
      "Israel\u2019s military and a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry condemned the flotilla Monday. Without providing evidence, Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X it was \u201corganized by Hamas\u201d and \u201cintended to serve Hamas.\u201d",
      "He added that Israel would not allow the flotilla to \u201center an active combat zone and will not allow the breach of a lawful naval blockade.\u201d",
      "Marmorstein also called for the flotilla to dock at Israel\u2019s Ashkelon Marina and unload aid there for it to be transferred to Gaza.",
      "But GSF has argued that Israel is violating international law in Gaza, rendering its blockade illegal.",
      "The flotilla, which is carrying more than 500 people from more than 40 countries, set sail from Barcelona late last month in a bid to \u201cbreak the illegal siege of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Gaza has been under an Israeli naval blockade since 2007, when Hamas took power.",
      "GSF said this month that two of its boats had been attacked by drones while it was stationed in Tunisia.",
      "The Tunisian Interior Ministry said at the time that reports that a drone hit a boat at its Sidi Bou Said port had \u201cno basis in truth\u201d and that a fire broke out on the vessel itself, according to Reuters.",
      "Israeli forces continue their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks in 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, Palestinian health officials say, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, while much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.",
      "This week, Tom Barrack, the U.S. special envoy to Syria and ambassador to Turkey, accused Israel of \u201cattacking everybody\u201d in an interview with The National, the state-owned English-language daily newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "He named Syria and Lebanon among those attacked, as well as Tunisia, in an apparent reference to the alleged attack on the aid flotilla.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I hate what\u2019s happened in Gaza on all sides,\u201d Barrack told the newspaper. \u201cFor the Palestinians, for the Israelis, for the Jordanians, for the Lebanese, for the Syrians, for the Turks. You know ... it\u2019s a mess.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsrael is a valued ally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe subsidize them\" by $4 billion to $5 billion a year. \"It has a special place in America\u2019s heart, and we\u2019re living with the confusion of what\u2019s happening in this transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s complicated,\u201d he added."

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 You'd forgive Ukrainians double-checking their Truth Social feeds.",
      "There was a mix of astonishment and reservation in Kyiv on Wednesday \u2014 contrasted with bitter dismissal and some mocking defiance in Moscow \u2014 after President Donald Trump said Ukraine could reclaim all of its territory, a dramatic change in rhetoric on the war.",
      "The Kremlin rejected Trump\u2019s description of Russia as a \u201cpaper tiger,\u201d saying its military was advancing and its economy stable rather than suffering \"big\" problems as the president suggested. But in Ukraine, the sudden reversal was greeted cautiously as a welcome shift from the U.S. leader that still left much to be answered.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly insisted that giving up territory to Russia in a peace deal was not an option, and hailed the \u201cbig shift\u201d in Trump\u2019s position after meeting with him in New York.",
      "\"Of course, we are doing everything to make sure Europe really helps, and of course we count on the United States,\" he told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, while expressing his appreciation for the support.",
      "\"But in the end, peace depends on all of us,\" he said.",
      "Trump had long maintained that an end to the war would require Ukraine ceding territory, but months of failed diplomacy have seemingly fueled frustrations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"I was almost amazed to hear it from him, it was powerful,\" Maryna Lozova, 32, said. \"But there is one huge \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 we should definitely remember how often he changes his mind, and how crazy some of his ideas are,\" the housewife in Kyiv told NBC News.",
      "Others were similarly reluctant to celebrate given what they saw as a number of recent U-turns on the subject, as Trump first welcomed Putin to Alaska, then met with Zelenskyy and European leaders, each time leaving his guests feeling positive about their efforts.",
      "\u201cI would like to believe in deeds, not words,\u201d said Volodymyr Rzhavskyy, a 44-year-old entrepreneur from the front-line Donetsk region. He called on Trump to \u201cprovide Ukraine with maximum opportunity to regain its territorial integrity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that if we really are provided with enough weapons and the support we need, then we have the opportunity to return our land,\u201d he said.",
      "Lozova said she knew \"for sure, that Ukraine can return the territories,\" and was thankful that \u201cfinally, someone recognizes this and does not question it.\u201d",
      "But she pointed to Trump's comment in his lengthy Truth Social post that it was with help from Europe and NATO, not the U.S., that Ukraine might retake its land. \"That raises some questions,\" she said.",

      "\u201cYes, Trump suddenly told the world about his love for Ukraine,\u201d said Konstantin Malofeyev, an ultranationalist tycoon and political influencer.",
      "\u201cBut the main point ... is that the U.S. is washing its hands of the matter,\" he said.",

      "The idea that Ukraine can \"win back something is, from our point of view, an erroneous talking point,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia was not a paper tiger, he said in an earlier radio interview, but \"more often associated with a bear. And paper bears don\u2019t exist.\"",
      "Russia currently controls roughly 19% of Ukraine following its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, according to open source maps of the battlefield cited by Reuters. Peskov claimed its advance may be slow in a deliberate bid to minimize casualties.",
      "\u201cOf course, President Trump heard Zelenskyy\u2019s version of events. And apparently at this point, this version is the reason for the assessment we heard,\u201d Peskov said.",

      "The U.S. is just \u201cone phone call to the Kremlin away from a potential shift back again,\u201d said Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute.",
