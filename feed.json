      "Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, has died at age 82",
      "MILAN -- Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton's provocative ad campaigns of the 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, died Monday at age 82.",
      "Toscani disclosed last year that he was suffering from a rare disease and did not know how long he had to live.",
      "\"It is with immense pain that we announce that our beloved Oliviero has undertaken his next journey,'' his wife Kirsti and their three children said in a statement Monday.",
      "Toscani suffered from amyloidosis, a disease characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the body. He told Corriere della Sera last August that he lost had 40 kilograms (nearly 90 pounds) in a year, adding, \"I don\u2019t know how long I have left to live, but I\u2019m not interested in living like this anyway.\u201d",
      "Toscani said he would like to be remembered \u201cnot for any one photo but for my whole work, for the commitment.\u201d",
      "Toscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1990s that featured images such as the pope kissing an imam on the lips, which angered the Vatican.",
      "Others promoting the United Colors of Benetton depicted a priest embracing a nun, a newborn baby with its umbilical cord, and a black woman breastfeeding a white baby, part of the brand\u2019s advocacy for diversity, religious tolerance and environmental messages.",
      "His decadeslong relationship with Benetton was severed after Toscani outraged relatives of victims in the deadly 2018 Genoa bridge collapse, telling RAI television, \"Who cares about a bridge collapse?\u201d He was responding to a public flap over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family, which controlled the company that maintained the bridge.",
      "Toscani apologized in an interview with La Repubblica, saying: \u201cI am sorry. More: I am ashamed to apologize. I am humanly destroyed and deeply pained.\" But the damage was done, and Benetton completely cut ties with him."

      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",

      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",

      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",

But the actor-producer still struggled to reconcile his relief with the haunting sight of his ravaged, once lavish community.",

      "\u201cI've seen people scared, people in wheelchairs, mothers and fathers trying to find their kids, people having anxiety and panic attacks,\u201d said Guttenberg, who returned to his neighborhood to help others who stayed behind with relief efforts. He has helped move cars to clear the street, handed out food and assisted neighbors from out their homes.",
      "\"All these houses behind me burned to the ground where their families enjoyed wonderful times together with their friends and family,\" said Guttenberg while pointing at one charred home before dropping his head in sadness. \u201cThere's really a lot of pain going on right now. I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",

      "Otto Schenk, an actor who became a noted director praised for traditional opera productions and criticized by advocates of contemporary approaches, died Thursday at age 94.",
      "Schenk lived in Austria, and his death was announced by the Vienna State Opera.",
      "He created 31 productions there, starting with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d in 1964 and ending with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d in 2014. Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",
      "Born in Vienna, Schenk studied acting at Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts, began directing in 1953 and led his first opera, Mozart's \u201cDie Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute),\" at Salzburg's State Theatre in 1957. He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",
      "\u201cThe theater world has lost one of its greatest phenomena, an exceptional artist, a real legend,\u201d current Salzburg Festival artistic director Markus Hinterh\u00e4user said in a statement.",
      "At the Met, his stagings of Offenbach's \u201cLes Contes d\u2019Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann)\u201d and Wagner's \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d in 1977 earned rave reviews, and Met artistic director James Levine picked him to direct a new Ring Cycle plus Wagner's \u201cParsifal\u201d in 1991 and \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\" in 1993.",
      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",
      "\u201cWagner in his life gave no indication on what the Ring meant,\" Schenk told the AP. \"He didn\u2019t interpret.\u201d"

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA!

      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",

      "The untelevised but starry NBR Awards were a chance for many of the nominees who didn\u2019t win Sunday to trot out their would-be acceptance speeches, including Daniel Craig, Kieran Culkin and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Accepting the award for best actress for her performance in the erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl,\u201d Kidman celebrated by chugging a glass of milk, a nod to some of the film's kinky sex games. After finishing, Kidman triumphantly announced \u201cGood girl!\" and left the stage.",
      "It also was an opportunity for some jabs at the Globes. \u201cIsn\u2019t this room just a little bit classier than the Beverly Hilton?\u201c quipped presenter Christine Baranski, looking around the elegant marble-columned midtown venue, Cipriani\u2019s.",

      "The night belonged to Jon M. Chu's \u201cWicked.\u201d The musical was the board's pick for best film, best director for Chu and a special award for the creative collaboration of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. The two, in back-and-forth remarks, continued their mutual praise of each other.",

      "Chu, who was introduced by Lin Manuel-Miranda, used the moment to reflect on his yearslong journey with \u201cWicked,\u201d which will be followed by an already-shot part two due out this November. So lengthy has his time in Oz been that the director noted he had three children during its making, including one born the day of the movie's premiere.",

      "\u201cThe man missed the premiere of his own film so he could attend the birth of his fifth child,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI barely made it to the inception of my own children.\u201d",
      "The common theme of the night was community and togetherness. Coming a day after the anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and less than two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, many alluded to Hollywood's role in the coming years.",

      "A key feature of the NBR Awards, which were founded in 1909 by film enthusiasts, is its style of award presentation. Each winner is introduced by a close friend, collaborator or admirer. Last year\u2019s surprise guest was Daniel Day-Lewis, who presented for Martin Scorsese and the best-film winner \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\"",
      "This year, Robert Pattinson dropped in to introduce India Donaldson, winner of the breakthrough director award for her acclaimed debut \u201cGood One.\u201d Pattinson called Donaldson \u201cone of the most exciting filmmakers working today.\u201d",

      "Other introductions were more surprising. John Lithgow, there as part of the \u201cConclave\u201d group that won best ensemble, introduced breakthrough performance winner and \u201cAnora\u201d star Mikey Madison. Lithgow had only just met her but profusely praised her performance, listing a wide array of its traits, one of which drew giggles from the crowd, and the 25-year-old Madison.",

      "",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, MD, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "",
      "An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a healthcare consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",
      "Hofer said the growing impact may make some people deny climate change, ignore it or become numb to it as \u201ca way to avoid what's psychologically uncomfortable.\"",
      "Such a week can also energize positive change, she said. But Hofer said she thinks that will be harder, at least in the U.S., as Trump takes office. He's promised to halt federal climate action and repeal existing legislation aimed at the problem.",
      "\u201cI worry about the denial, the misinformation, and the forces that are feeding that denial,\" she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to address.\u201d",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "\"We would prefer to provide your care ourselves, but Providence executives' refusal to continue meeting with caregivers has forced us onto the picket line to advocate for you, our communities, and our colleagues,\" the statement continued. \"Going into a hospital or clinic to get the care you need is not crossing our strike line.

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "Hurricane Helene brought unprecedented and catastrophic flooding to western North Carolina, damaging a Baxter manufacturing site that was a major supplier of IV fluids. Hospitals across the country continue to grapple with the ensuing shortage of critical supplies.",
      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of militant-held hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel",
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of militant-held hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "But despite intensive mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues, including the details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "As each side has accused the other of backtracking, the war has ground on.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed each day in Israeli strikes, and most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are huddled in squalid tent camps, their neighborhoods in ruins. Humanitarian groups struggle to deliver desperately needed aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "In Israel, families of the hostages have held weekly rallies demanding a deal for their release, fearing their loved ones will die in the harsh conditions of their captivity the longer the fighting drags on.",
      "Here's a look at the main points of contention.",
      "Hamas and other groups are still holding around 100 hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The Israeli military has declared a third of the hostages dead, but suspects that the true number could be around half.",
      "Hamas is demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed civilians. Israel is reluctant to free such prisoners, especially since one of the masterminds of the 2023 attack, the slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, was a former prisoner released in such a deal.",
      "The two sides have exchanged lists of names, with Israel demanding more information about which hostages are alive to ensure they come out first. Hamas says it needs at least a brief truce to determine the status of the hostages, because they are being held by various groups in scattered, secret locations.",
      "The emerging deal calls for a multiphase plan. In the first stage, Hamas would release the most vulnerable hostages and Israeli forces would pull back from some areas, allowing some Palestinians to return to their homes and a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "In the second step \u2014 which would be negotiated during the first \u2014 the rest of the living hostages would be released in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages without assurances that the war will end. Israel's offensive has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, which don't say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Hamas likely fears that Israel will resume its offensive \u2014 and step up its intensity \u2014 once the hostages are out and the militants no longer have their most valuable bargaining chip.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do just that. He says that Israel won't end the war until it has destroyed Hamas' military and governing abilities and ensured that the Palestinian militant group no longer poses a threat.",
      "The lack of trust goes both ways: Israelis fear that Hamas will drag out negotiations over the second phase, extending the ceasefire indefinitely while the hostages languish.",
      "The talks nearly collapsed last summer when Netanyahu said that Israel would maintain a lasting presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.",
      "Israel says Hamas has long smuggled weapons into Gaza through tunnels beneath the corridor and that it must control the area to prevent Hamas from rebuilding. Egypt, a key mediator, says it blocked the tunnels years ago, and is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border.",
      "Israel has also demanded a mechanism for inspecting people returning to their homes in northern Gaza, from which around a million people fled following Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war. Their return is a key Hamas demand, the details of which are still being worked out.",
      "Israel says people returning to the north should be searched for weapons. That would probably require an Israeli presence in what's known as the Netzarim corridor, a strip of closed roads and military installations stretching from the border to the sea just south of Gaza City.",
      "The Palestinians are opposed to any permanent Israeli occupation, though Hamas has reportedly shown flexibility on the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Israel says Hamas can never again rule Gaza, but it has yet to endorse a realistic plan for an alternative government. With no internal rivals, Hamas has been able to quickly regroup after Israeli operations, even in the hardest-hit areas, and still controls much of the territory.",
      "The Biden administration has long pushed for a grand bargain in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern postwar Gaza with the support of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which would also take the historic step of forging ties with Israel.",
      "But Arab and Muslim leaders say they will only sign onto such plans if they include a pathway to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Netanyahu says that Israel will maintain open-ended security control while delegating governance to politically independent Palestinians. But none appear to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel in running the territory.",
      "Hamas has said, however, that it's willing to relinquish control of Gaza to other Palestinians. Late last year, it agreed to an Egyptian-brokered plan for a group of independents to govern the territory under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has yet to accept the proposal.",
      "Hamas has also demanded the lifting of a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after it seized power in 2007, which experts say is needed for Gaza to be rebuilt.",
      "The lifting of the blockade, however, would allow Hamas to claim a major victory and to eventually rebuild its military capabilities. That's another nonstarter for Israel.",

      "ISTANBUL -- The mayor of one of Turkey\u2019s opposition strongholds was arrested Monday as part of a bid-rigging investigation, prosecutors in Istanbul said.",
      "Riza Akpolat, who heads Besiktas municipality on the city\u2019s European side, was detained at his summer house in Edremit on Turkey\u2019s west coast, private news agency DHA reported.",
      "Besiktas has long been under the control of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP. It is one of the city\u2019s main entertainment centers and home to the famous soccer club of the same name.",
      "\u201cA criminal organization \u2026 organized the tender processes by bribing mayors and senior executives of municipalities and ensuring that their own companies were awarded the tenders,\u201d the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office said in a statement.",
      "CHP Chairman Ozgur Ozel described the arrest as \u201ca new link in the chain of lawlessness in the politicized justice system\u201d and vowed to stand by Akpolat.",
      "The CHP mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, said the dawn raid on Akpolat\u2019s home was part of an attempt to influence public opinion.",
      "\u201cThe procedure of those who do not have legal intentions cannot be legal,\u201d he said.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office said a three-month investigation led to arrest warrants for 47 people, including Akpolat and Ahmet Ozer, the CHP mayor of Istanbul\u2019s Esenyurt district.",
      "Ozer has been behind bars since October as part of a separate investigation into his alleged connections to the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK.",
      "The tender-rigging scheme was allegedly led by a man named Aziz Ihsan Aktas, prosecutors said. He and 24 other suspects were detained on charges of establishing and running a criminal organization, being members of a criminal organization, bribery, bid-rigging, violating tax laws and asset laundering.",
      "Police set up barriers around Besiktas municipal offices while Akpolat\u2019s office was searched and checked staff IDs before allowing workers to enter.",
      "Akpolat, 42, was elected Besiktas mayor in 2019 with nearly three-quarters of the vote, having previously run unsuccessfully for parliament on the CHP ticket.",
      "Along with other municipal officers, he was detained on charges of membership in a criminal organization, bid-rigging, bribery and unjust acquisition of property.",
      "Since opposition parties successfully won control of major cities across Turkey in 2019 \u2014 and retained them in last year\u2019s local elections \u2014 local officials have often been arrested and removed from office. Members of the pro-Kurdish party have been the main targets over alleged ties to the PKK.",
      "Two co-mayors from the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, were jailed Monday pending trial on terrorism-related charges. A government-appointed trustee was placed to run the Akdeniz municipality in Mersin on Turkey\u2019s south coast."

      "The $932 million project includes a second tunnel and a series of bridges and high mountain roads that will link Kashmir with Ladakh, a cold desert region nestled between India, Pakistan and China that has faced territorial disputes for decades.",
      "Amid high security, Narendra Modi visited the resort town of Sonamarg where he inaugurated the 6.5-kilometer (4-mile) tunnel. The town denotes the end of the conifer-clad mountains of the Kashmir Valley before Ladakh begins across the rocky Zojila mountain pass. The tunnel, named Z-Morh, will now grant it accessibility for the first time all year round.",
      "The second tunnel, about 14 kilometers (9 miles) long, will bypass the challenging Zojila pass and connect Sonamarg with Ladakh and is expected to be completed in 2026.",
      "Sonamarg and Ladakh have been plagued with severe snowfalls that close the mountain passes due to massive snowfalls, forcing them to remain cut off from neighboring towns for nearly six months every year.",
      "Authorities on Monday deployed police and soldiers in the area and established multiple checkpoints at key intersections as an enhanced security measure for the prime minister\u2019s visit. Troops also stationed sharpshooters at several points and carried out drone surveillance to ensure constant vigilance.",
      "Modi later at a public meeting, attended by hundreds of people, said the ambitious project would improve road connectivity and boost tourism in the region. The meeting also was attended by some of Modi's Cabinet ministers and Kashmir's chief minister Omar Abdullah.",
      "Experts say the tunnel project is important to the military, which will gain significantly improved capabilities to operate in Ladakh while also providing civilians with freedom of movement year-round between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh.",
      "In October, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people working on the tunnel project and injured at least five others. Police blamed insurgents fighting for decades against Indian rule in the region.",
      "In 2019, New Delhi stripped Kashmir\u2019s special status as a semi-autonomous region with a separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. The federal government also downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, the first time in the history of India that a region\u2019s statehood was downgraded to a federally administered territory.",
      "India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict."

      "Officials say U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but a deal has not been reached yet",
      "CAIRO -- U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but a deal hasn't been reached yet, officials said Monday.",
      "Three officials acknowledged that progress has been made and said the coming days would be critical for ending more than 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the talks.",
      "One of the three officials and a Hamas official said that there were still a number of hurdles to clear. On several occasions over the past year, U.S. officials have said that they were on the verge of reaching a deal, only to have the talks stall.",
      "One person familiar with the talks said there had been a breakthrough overnight and that there was a proposed deal on the table. Israeli and Hamas negotiators will now take it back to their leaders for final approval, the person said.",
      "The person said that mediators from the Gulf country of Qatar had put renewed pressure on Hamas to accept the agreement, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, was pressing the Israelis. Witkoff recently joined the negotiations and has been in the region in recent days.",
      "The person said that the mediators had handed off the draft deal to each side and that the next 24 hours would be pivotal.",
      "An Egyptian official said that there had been good progress overnight, but that it would likely take a few more days, and that the sides were aiming for a deal before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. A third official said that the talks were in a good place, but hadn't been wrapped up. That official also assessed that a deal was possible before the inauguration.",
      "Asked about the talks at a press conference, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said \u201cprogress has been made, and I hope that within a short time we will see things happening. But it is still to be proved.\"",
      "A Hamas official said a number of contentious issues still need to be resolved, including an Israeli commitment to ending the war and details about the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the hostage-prisoner exchange. The official wasn't authorized to brief media and spoke anonymously.",
      "The Egyptian official confirmed that those issues were still being discussed.",
      "The Biden administration, along with Egypt and Qatar, has spent more than a year trying to broker an agreement to end the deadliest war ever fought between Israelis and Palestinians and secure the release of scores of hostages captured in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the conflict.",
      "But the sides have been divided over the details of the planned exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as the nature of the ceasefire itself. Hamas has said that it won't release the remaining captives without an end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the campaign until \u201ctotal victory\u201d over the militant group.",
      "Under discussion now is a phased ceasefire. Netanyahu has repeatedly signaled that he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting. The possibility of a lasting ceasefire and other issues would be negotiated after the first phase begins. Hamas has demanded a full withdrawal and complete end to the war, and is hoping that this first phase will lead to that outcome.",
      "A deal could weaken Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, which includes two far-right factions that have threatened to leave the government if Israel makes too many concessions. Members of the opposition have promised to give Netanyahu the support that he needs to approve a hostage release, but the hardliners' anger could be a source of instability down the road.",
      "Netanyahu is hoping that the prospect of a Trump administration \u2014 which includes allies of the West Bank settler movement \u2014 will persuade his partners to remain in the government.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden, who hopes to wrap up a deal before leaving office next week, spoke with Netanyahu about the talks on Sunday.",
      "The head of Israel\u2019s Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and Biden\u2019s top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, were both in the Qatari capital, Doha. Barnea\u2019s presence meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are once again involved in the talks.",
      "McGurk has been working on final details of a text to be presented to both sides, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d But he said that he would not predict whether a deal can be reached by Jan. 20.",
      "\u201cWe are very, very close,\u201d he said. \u201cYet being very close still means we\u2019re far, because until you actually get across the finish line, we\u2019re not there.\u201d",
      "Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved during the war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that a deal is \u201cvery close\u201d and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count doesn't give a breakdown between fighters and civilians. Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others in the attack that ignited the war.",
      "Families of the roughly 100 hostages still held in Gaza are pressing Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home. Israelis rallied again Saturday night in Tel Aviv, with photos of hostages on display.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians were tempering their hopes for a stop to Israel\u2019s campaign, which has devastated much of the territory and driven around 90% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.",
      "\u201cWe hear that there are negotiations every day, but we see nothing,\u201d said Mazen Hammad, a resident of the southern city of Khan Younis. \u201cWhen we see it on the ground, then we believe that there is a truce.\u201d",

      "The Congolese army says several towns that fell to armed groups in the eastern North Kivu and South Kivu provinces have been recaptured by government forces",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Several towns that fell to armed groups in eastern Congo\u2019s North Kivu and South Kivu provinces have been recaptured by government forces, a Congolese army spokesman said, even as the rebels have made advances in other areas amid intensified fighting in the conflict-battered region.",
      "Eastern Congo has been in conflict for decades with more than 100 armed groups, most of which are vying for territory in the vast and mineral-rich region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who have fled their homes this year.",
      "The Congolese army said some of the recovered towns have been occupied by rebels for months, including Ngungu, a key town in the Masisi territory that is near the North Kivu provincial capital, Goma. Some Masisi villages, however, remain under the control of rebels, including its center known as the Masisi Center.",
      "\u201cThey (the rebels) have seen their adventure come to a halt by the FARDC (Congolese security forces),\u201d Guillaume Ndjike Kaiko, army spokesman in North Kivu, told reporters, listing other recovered towns as Lumbishi, Ruzirantaka, Kamatale, Bitagata and Kabingo.",
      "\u201cAll over there, they have been pushed back,\u201d Kaiko said Sunday, attributing the victories to a joint military operation led by the commanders of the two provinces.",
      "The news of the recovered towns brought mixed feelings among villages that had fled the areas. They worried for their safety as they celebrated their return home.",
      "\u201cWe are in Ngungu \u2026 but we continue to suffer because the security is not well established,\u201d said Nsabimana Alexis, a resident. \u201cPeople continue to die, we just buried a person 30 minutes ago,\u201d he said.",
      "Frequent clashes between the Congolese forces and the rebels have made dozens of villages inaccessible and out of the reach of aid. The most dominant rebel group in the region has been the M23 rebel group, which the Congolese government and United Nations experts say is being backed by neighboring Rwanda. Rwanda denies this.",
      "In Masisi, displaced camps and aid facilities are being overstretched as more people try to seek refuge from the violence, French charity Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, has said.",
      "\u201cWe are doing our best to respond to this situation. But the severe lack of humanitarian responders in the area is making things difficult,\u201d said Romain Briey, the MSF coordinator in Masisi."

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s spy agency has told lawmakers that two North Korean soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces while fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region haven\u2019t expressed a desire to seek asylum in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers on Monday that two North Korean soldiers who were captured by Ukrainian forces while fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region haven\u2019t expressed a desire to seek asylum in South Korea.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the social media platform X that he\u2019s willing to hand over the soldiers to North Korea if the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Un, arranges for an exchange with Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia. Zelenskyy added that \u201cthere may be other options\u201d for North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return home, and a video released by his government indicated that at least one of the captured soldiers expressed a desire to remain in Ukraine.",
      "In a closed-door briefing at South Korea\u2019s National Assembly, the National Intelligence Service confirmed its participation in the questioning of the North Korean soldiers by Ukrainian authorities. The agency said the soldiers haven\u2019t expressed a request to resettle in South Korea, according to two lawmakers who attended the meeting.",
      "The agency said it was willing to discuss the matter with Ukrainian authorities if the soldiers eventually do ask to go to South Korea. About 34,000 North Koreans have defected to capitalist rival South Korea to avoid economic hardship and political suppression at home, mostly since the late 1990s.",
      "Koo Byoungsam, spokesperson of South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said facilitating the asylum of the North Korean soldiers would require \u201clegal reviews, including on international law, and consultations with related nations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can say at the current stage,\u201d Koo said.",
      "Seoul\u2019s spy agency believes that about 300 North Korean soldiers have died and another 2,700 have been injured while fighting against Ukrainian forces, in what represents North Korea's first involvement in large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War.",
      "The agency assessed that the North Koreans are struggling to adapt to drones and other elements of modern warfare. They are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have thrown them in assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, according to Lee Seong Kweun, a lawmaker who attended the agency\u2019s briefing.",
      "The agency said memos found on dead North Korean soldiers indicated that they had been ordered to commit suicide before being captured, according to Lee. The agency said one North Korean soldier, facing the threat of being captured by Ukrainian forces, shouted \u201cGeneral Kim Jong Un\u201d and tried to detonate a hand grenade before he was shot and killed.",
      "Zelenskyy confirmed the capture of the North Korean soldiers on Saturday, days after Ukraine, facing a slow Russian onslaught in the east, began pressing new attacks in Kursk to retain ground captured in a lightning incursion in August \u2014 the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II.",
      "Moscow\u2019s counterattack has left Ukrainian forces outstretched and demoralized, killing and wounding thousands and retaking more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk that Ukraine had seized.",
      "Moon Seong Mook, a retired South Korean brigadier general, said the high death toll for North Korean soldiers was predictable, as they would not have been sufficiently prepared for an unfamiliar mission in the terrain of the Kursk region, which is vastly different from North Korea\u2019s mountainous landscape.",
      "Another disadvantage for the North Koreans is that they are not conducting independent operations but are being thrust into combat under Russian commanders, possibly struggling with unfamiliar tactics and communication issues due to language barriers, said Moon, who has taken part in numerous military talks with North Korea. The North Korean forces could be operating special surveillance teams to arrest or execute attempted deserters, he said.",
      "\u201cThe current battlefield environment, combined with drones and other technologies, have created situations North Korean soldiers have never encountered before,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThey are also being deployed in large numbers in wide-open fields, where there is no place to hide, in continuous battles to retake the area, and that seems to be where the casualties are coming from.\u201d",
      "North Korea\u2019s decadeslong financial troubles, which have forced many soldiers to grow their own food or spend long hours deployed in construction and other work to sustain the national economy, could also have impacted the quality of training they receive at home, Moon said.",
      "Still, there are concerns in Seoul that North Korea\u2019s participation in the Ukraine crisis poses a significant threat to South Korea, as North Korean forces may gain crucial combat experience and Russia may provide technology transfers that could enhance North Korea\u2019s nuclear-armed army.",

      "A fresh drive to bring an end to Turkey's 40-year Kurdish conflict has seen politicians from the pro-Kurdish party meet jailed leaders",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Talks between politicians from Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish party and jailed Kurdish leaders have been gathering steam as they try to end 40 years of fighting between the state and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK.",
      "The latest peace effort comes at a time of heightened instability and fundamental changes reshaping the region. These include the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, the weakening of the Hezbollah militant movement in Lebanon, and the reconfiguration of power in Syria after the toppling of President Bashar Assad.",
      "The cautious process was initiated in October by Devlet Bahceli, a firebrand ultranationalist who has usually opposed any concessions to Kurdish identity or rights.",
      "Since then, the fall of Assad in a lightning rebel offensive has triggered intensified fighting between Turkish-backed and Kurdish groups in northern Syria.",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who have controlled northeast Syria for the past decade, are under attack from the Syrian National Army, an umbrella of militias fighting on behalf of Turkey, which regards the SDF as an extension of the PKK and wants to neutralize it as an independent fighting force.",
      "Recently, senior members of the Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, met jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and Selahattin Demirtas, another imprisoned figurehead of the Kurdish movement. They have also met with the leaders of other political parties to explain their discussions.",
      "The Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, has waged an armed insurgency against Turkey since 1984, initially with the aim of establishing a Kurdish state in the southeast of the country. Over time, the objective evolved into a campaign for autonomy and rights for Kurds within Turkey.",
      "The conflict between militants and state forces, which has spread beyond Turkey\u2019s borders into Iraq and Syria, has killed tens of thousands of people. The PKK is considered to be a terror group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.",
      "Abdullah Ocalan, who as a student of political science in Ankara became deeply involved in leftist movements, formed the PKK in 1978 as a Marxist organization. He fled to Syria in 1979, along with other PKK members, where he remained until 1998, when Syria expelled him under intense pressure from Turkey.",
      "Ocalan was captured in Kenya in 1999 and imprisoned on Imrali island in the Sea of Marmara, where he remains to this day. His death sentence for treason was commuted to a life term in prison after Turkey abolished the death penalty.",
      "The 75-year-old endures as a symbol for Kurdish independence and rights and continues to wield influence over the Kurdish movement, with past messages relayed through family members or lawyers resonating beyond Turkey, in Iraq and Syria.",
      "In a message relayed by his nephew in December, Ocalan said he has the power to end the conflict if the conditions are right.",
      "In October, Bahceli, a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, suggested Ocalan could be granted parole if he renounces violence and disbands the PKK. It was a major shift for the hardline politician who had previously strongly supported the state\u2019s military action against the militant group and its affiliates in neighboring Syria and rejected any notion of negotiation.",
      "Erdogan appears to have endorsed Bahceli's stance.",
      "There is a mixed reaction among politicians and analysts to suggestions of a new peace effort. Some describe it it as a historic opportunity, while others strongly oppose any notion of leniency toward Ocalan or the PKK.",
      "A recent attack on Turkey\u2019s key aerospace company outside of Ankara that killed several people was claimed by the PKK, complicating the debate.",
      "There have been several peace efforts between the Turkish state and the PKK over the years, including secret negotiations held in Oslo, Norway from 2009 until 2011. However, none have yielded results.",
      "The last attempt to reach a peace deal took place between 2013 and 2015 with a series of talks between Turkish officials and Ocalan, who declared a ceasefire and withdrew fighters to bases in northern Iraq.",
      "Turkish officials took steps to improve Kurdish rights, including allowing Kurdish-language broadcasts. The process collapsed in July 2015, after a series of violent attacks, including one by the Islamic State group that killed 33 pro-Kurdish activists.",
      "Since then, Turkey has cracked down on its pro-Kurdish movement and has jailed thousands of people, including the former leader of the main pro-Kurdish political party, Selahattin Demirtas, over alleged links to the PKK.",
      "The latest peace effort comes at a time when Turkey and the Kurds are both seeking security to face the challenges in the Middle East.",
      "However, some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan\u2019s government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",
      "Bahceli has openly called for a new constitution, saying it was essential to keep Erdogan in power for Turkey\u2019s future. Erdogan and Bahceli are reportedly seeking parliamentary support from the DEM."

      "PRAYAGRAJ, India -- Millions of Hindu devotees, mystics and holy men and women from all across India flocked to the northern city of Prayagraj on Monday to kickstart the Maha Kumbh festival, which is being touted as the world's largest religious gathering.",
      "Over about the next six weeks, Hindu pilgrims with gather at the confluence of three sacred rivers \u2014 the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati \u2014 where they will take part in elaborate rituals, hoping to begin a journey to achieve Hindu philosophy\u2019s ultimate goal: the release from the cycle of rebirth.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the festival:",
      "Hindus venerate rivers, and none more so than the Ganges and the Yamuna. The faithful believe that a dip in their waters will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation, particularly on auspicious days. The most propitious of these days occur in cycles of 12 years during a festival called the Maha Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival.",
      "The festival is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at the confluence of three sacred rivers that dates to at least medieval times. Hindus believe that the mythical Saraswati river once flowed from the Himalayas through Prayagraj, meeting there with the Ganges and the Yamuna.",
      "Bathing takes place every day, but on the most auspicious dates, naked, ash-smeared monks charge toward the holy rivers at dawn. Many pilgrims stay for the entire festival, observing austerity, giving alms and bathing at sunrise every day.",
      "\u201cWe feel peaceful here and attain salvation from the cycles of life and death,\u201d said Bhagwat Prasad Tiwari, a pilgrim.",
      "The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pitcher containing the nectar of immortality from demons. Hindus believe that a few drops fell in the cities of Prayagraj, Nasik, Ujjain and Haridwar \u2014 the four places where the Kumbh festival has been held for centuries.",
      "The Kumbh rotates among these four pilgrimage sites about every three years on a date prescribed by astrology. This year\u2019s festival is the biggest and grandest of them all. A smaller version of the festival, called Ardh Kumbh, or Half Kumbh, was organized in 2019, when 240 million visitors were recorded, with about 50 million taking a ritual bath on the busiest day.",
      "At least 400 million people \u2014 more than the population of the United States \u2014 are expected in Prayagraj over the next 45 days, according to officials. That is around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims that arrived in the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year.",
      "The festival is a big test for Indian authorities to showcase the Hindu religion, tourism and crowd management.",
      "A vast ground along the banks of the rivers has been converted into a sprawling tent city equipped with more 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 restrooms. Divided into 25 sections and spreading over 40 square kilometers (15 square miles), the tent city also has housing, roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals. Murals depicting stories from Hindu scriptures are painted on the city walls.",
      "Indian Railways has also introduced more than 90 special trains that will make nearly 3,300 trips during the festival to transport devotees, beside regular trains.",
      "About 50,000 security personnel \u2014 a 50% increase from 2019 \u2014 are also stationed in the city to maintain law and order and crowd management. More than 2,500 cameras, some powered by AI, will send crowd movement and density information to four central control rooms, where officials can quickly deploy personnel to avoid stampedes.",
      "India\u2019s past leaders have capitalized on the festival to strengthen their relationship with the country\u2019s Hindus, who make up nearly 80% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people. But under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the festival has become an integral part of its advocacy of Hindu nationalism. For Modi and his party, Indian civilization is inseparable from Hinduism, although critics say the party's philosophy is rooted in Hindu supremacy.",
      "The Uttar Pradesh state, headed by Adityanath \u2014 a powerful Hindu monk and a popular hard-line Hindu politician in Modi\u2019s party \u2014 has allocated more than $765 million for this year\u2019s event. It has also used the festival to boost his and the prime minister\u2019s image, with giant billboards and posters all over the city showing them both, alongside slogans touting their government welfare policies.",
      "The festival is expected to boost the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s past record of promoting Hindu cultural symbols for its support base. But recent Kumbh gatherings have also been caught in controversies.",
      "Modi's government changed the city\u2019s Mughal-era name from Allahabad to Prayagraj as part of its Muslim-to-Hindu name-changing effort nationwide ahead of the 2019 festival and the national election that his party won.

      "Gunmen have kidnapped an Austrian woman in Niger's Agadez city",
      "NIAMEY, Niger -- An Austrian woman has been kidnapped by gunmen in Niger's Agadez city, local residents and the Austrian Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, the first time a European citizen is known to have been kidnapped in the conflict-hit West African nation since a military junta took power in 2023.",
      "The ministry said Austria's embassy in Algeria, which is also responsible for Niger, had been informed of the kidnap of an Austrian woman in Agadez and was in contact with regional authorities on the ground.",
      "Residents and local media identified the victim as Eva Gretzmacher and reported she is an aid worker who has lived in Agadez \u2014 hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from the capital city of Niamey \u2014 for more than 20 years.",
      "\u201c(She) is well known for her social commitment (and) created a skills center in 2010 that initiated various projects, notably in the fields of education, women\u2019s empowerment, ecology, culture and art,\u201d the local Air Info Agadez reported.",
      "Gretzmacher also supported education programs through her development work and provided assistance to local non-government organizations in various sectors, local media said.",
      "No group claimed responsibility for her abduction and authorities in Niger did not immediately comment on the incident.",
      "Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country's government in July 2023. Despite their promise to restore peace in hot spots, the junta\u2019s capacity to improve Niger\u2019s security has increasingly been questioned amid increasing attacks.",
      "Niger was seen as one of the last democratic countries in Africa\u2019s Sahel region that Western nations could partner with to beat back the jihadi insurgency in the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert. The country has severed decadeslong military ties with the West and turned to Russia as a new security partner."

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden have spoken in a phone call on the latest efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release in the Israel-Hamas war",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden spoke Sunday about efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Israel-Hamas war, a sign of the intensifying push to reach a deal before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next week.",
      "Talks mediated over the past year by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly stalled at moments when they seemed close to a deal. Still, in recent days, U.S. officials have expressed hope of sealing an agreement.",
      "Sunday\u2019s call between Biden and Netanyahu came as the head of Israel\u2019s Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and Biden\u2019s top Mideast adviser, Brett McGurk, were both in the Qatari capital Doha. Barnea\u2019s presence, confirmed by Netanyahu\u2019s office, meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are now involved in talks.",
      "McGurk has been working on final details of a text to be presented to both sides, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d But he said he would not predict whether a deal can be reached by Jan. 20, the day of the inauguration.",
      "\u201cWe are very, very close,\u201d he said. \u201cYet being very close still means we\u2019re far because until you actually get across the finish line, we\u2019re not there.\u201d",
      "The White House and Netanyahu\u2019s office both confirmed the phone call between the two leaders without providing details.",
      "Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved in 15 months of war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week a deal is \u201cvery close\u201d and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Under discussion now is a phased ceasefire, with Netanyahu signaling he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting.",
      "Hamas has insisted on a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the largely devastated territory, but Netanyahu has insisted on destroying Hamas\u2019 ability to fight in Gaza.",
      "Issues in the talks have included which hostages would be released in the first part of a phased ceasefire deal, which Palestinian prisoners would be released and the extent of any Israeli troop withdrawal from population centers in Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count does not give a breakdown between fighters and civilians. Israel\u2019s campaign was triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others.",
      "Families of the roughly 100 hostages still held in Gaza are pressing Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home. Israelis rallied again Saturday night in the city of Tel Aviv, with photos of hostages on display.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians were tempering their hopes for a stop to Israel\u2019s campaign, which has devastated much of the territory and driven more than 80% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.",
      "\u201cWe hear that there are negotiations every day, but we see nothing,\u201d said Mazen Hammad, a resident of the southern city of Khan Younis. \u201cWhen we see it on the ground, then we believe that there is a truce.\u201d",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's striking university students protested outside the Balkan country's top court on Sunday to draw their attention to what they say have been violations of their civil rights under the populist authorities, including pressure from the secret service.",
      "The rally began with thousands of people standing in silence for 15 minutes in front of the Constitutional Court in the capital, Belgrade, to commemorate the victims of a concrete canopy collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad in November which triggered almost daily anti-corruption protests.",
      "A separate rally was also held in the southern city of Nis.",
      "The ongoing protests reflect wider discontent with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic\u2019s increasingly autocratic rule. Vucic formally says he wants to steer Serbia toward European Union membership but he has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them",
      "Classes at Serbia's universities have been suspended for weeks with the students demanding accountability for the canopy collapse at the railway station building in Novi Sad on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia believe the huge canopy collapsed because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption. The Novi Sad railway station building was renovated twice in recent years in a deal with Chinese state companies.",
      "Fourteen people were killed and three others were severely injured after tons of concrete crashed without warning. One more person later died while in the hospital.",
      "Striking students have reported pressure from Serbian state security and Vucic, who has accused the students of receiving money from the West for their protests.",
      "The pro-government media have bluntly published personal data of some of the protesters, which would not be possible without the involvement of Serbia's secret service, or BIA.",
      "Luka Stojakovic, who was targeted by the pro-government media along with his twin brother, told N1 television that \u201cwe have learned that BIA (Serbia\u2019s state security agency) can knock on our doors, conduct repression against our parents and invited us for a \u2018friendly\u2019 chat.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey published our (personal) data and no one was held responsible,\u201d said Stojakovic.",
      "\u201cI expect that there will be more pressure, I know there will be,\u201d added Stojakovic. \u201cI expect there will be pressure on our parents and that they will link us to political parties, but we will not give up until all our demands are fulfilled.\"",
      "Student protests have posed the biggest challenge so far on Vucic\u2019s tight grip on power. The students have received widespread popular support and their rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people.",
      "During their rally on Sunday, the protesters read out the articles of Serbia's Constitution that they say have been violated with the various forms of state pressure on their protests. Vucic's constitutional role as president should be mostly ceremonial, but instead he has gradually assumed control of almost all levers of power since taking office 13 years ago.",
      "In one of his frequent public appearances on state-controlled media, Vucic called the Sunday protest \u201cstupid\u201d and added that he will step down only when he decides to do so.",
      "\u201cThey (the protesters) live in their own world. They are not my problem, but I blame those who are pushing them about all this. I mean their professors,\u201d Vucic told Pink TV.",
      "Serbia\u2019s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people over the train station canopy collapse, including a government minister and several state officials. But doubts prevail over the probe\u2019s independence under the authorities."

      "Mayotte's people were ordered to stay indoors or find a solid shelter if they didn't have one, and store food and water, as Tropical Storm Dikeledi brought heavy rains and strong winds to once again pound France's poorest department.",
      "Mayotte, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa, had only just begun the process of rebuilding after the devastation of Cyclone Chido last month, which killed at least 39 people, left more than 200 still missing, and injured more than 5,000 when in struck on Dec. 14.",
      "Dikeledi passed over nearby Madagascar as a cyclone on Saturday but had weakened to a tropical storm by the time it reached Mayotte on Sunday, French meteorological service Meteo-France said.

      "Meteo-France warned Dikeledi could strengthen into a cyclone again, while authorities in Mayotte said there was a high danger of flooding and landslides and issued a red alert for the islands on Saturday night.

      "Officials said they were taking no chances after the devastation of Chido, which also prompted an angry reaction by Mayotte residents who vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron when he visited days after the disaster. Mayotte's people have previously accused the French government of neglecting them and the territory, which is the poorest in the European Union.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said more than 4,000 emergency personnel and security forces had been mobilized for Dikeledi's arrival, with much of the focus on the precarious shantytowns around the capital, Mamoudzou, and other areas, which were largely destroyed by Chido.",
      "National TV station Mayotte la 1\u00e8re said that the southern village of Mbouini, one of the few in Mayotte spared by Chido, had been flooded and almost totally destroyed by Dikeledi. Mayotte la 1\u00e8re broadcast video of the residents of Mbouini escaping in wooden canoes as their homes were submerged under flood water.",
      "Mayotte is a densely populated territory of around 320,000 people. Another 100,000 undocumented migrants from nearby Comoros and elsewhere are also believed to live on the islands, which are a draw for people from poorer countries because of the French welfare system.",
      "Chido was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years, authorities said. While 39 deaths have been confirmed, French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou warned on a visit to the islands two weeks ago that the final death toll could be several hundred. Authorities have faced challenges in recording the deaths and injuries from Chido because many of those affected were undocumented migrants, and also because of the Muslim practice of burying people within 24 hours of them dying.",
      "After smashing Mayotte, Chido made landfall on mainland Africa, killing more than 100 others in Mozambique and Malawi. Meteorologists expect Dikeledi to turn south and then east, tracking back toward Madagascar and out to sea after passing Mayotte.",
      "November to April is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and the region has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. The worst was Cyclone Idai in 2019, which killed more than 1,500 people in Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe and affected more than 3 million people.",

      "An emergency task force has arrived in Russia\u2019s southern Krasnodar region to deal with the continuing consequences of an oil spill in the Kerch Strait last month",
      "An emergency task force arrived in Russia\u2019s southern Krasnodar region on Sunday as an oil spill in the Kerch Strait from two storm-stricken tankers continues to spread a month after it was first detected, officials said.",
      "The task force, which includes Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov, was set up after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on authorities to ramp up the response to the spill, calling it \u201cone of the most serious environmental challenges we have faced in recent years.\"",
      "Kurenkov said that \u201cthe most difficult situation\u201d had developed near the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, where fuel oil continues to leak into the sea from the damaged part of the Volgoneft-239 tanker.",
      "Kurenkov was quoted as saying by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that the remaining oil will be pumped out of the tanker's stern.",
      "The Emergencies Ministry said Saturday that over 155,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil had been collected since oil spilled out of two tankers during a storm four weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, which separates the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula from the Krasnodar region.",
      "Russian-installed officials in Ukraine\u2019s partially Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region said Saturday that the mazut \u2014 a heavy, low-quality oil product \u2014 had reached the Berdyansk Spit, some 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of the Kerch Strait. It contaminated an area 14 1/2-kilometer (9-mile) long, Moscow-installed Gov. Yevgeny Balitsky wrote on Telegram.",
      "Russian-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency last weekend after oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula\u2019s largest city, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Kerch Strait.",
      "In response to Putin\u2019s call for action, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi accused Russia of \u201cbeginning to demonstrate its alleged \u2018concern\u2019 only after the scale of the disaster became too obvious to conceal its terrible consequences.\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia\u2019s practice of first ignoring the problem, then admitting its inability to solve it, and ultimately leaving the entire Black Sea region alone with the consequences is yet another proof of its international irresponsibility,\u201d Tykhyi said Friday.",
      "The Kerch Strait is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014.",
      "In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.",
      "Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office, described the oil spill last month as a \u201clarge-scale environmental disaster\u201d and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.",

      "HMPV, which belongs to the same family as the respiratory syncytial virus, causes flu or cold-like symptoms including fever, cough and nasal congestion. The symptoms often clear up by themselves, though they can cause lower respiratory tract infections among children, older adults and those immunocompromised.",
      "\u201cThe human metapneumovirus is not a new virus, and has been with humans for at least several decades,\u201d said Wang Liping, a researcher at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, during a press briefing by China\u2019s National Health Commission.",

It has invested in Indigo Technologies, which is commercializing a road sensing system developed at MIT. It also has a collaboration agreement with Blue Solutions to develop solid state batteries and has a collaboration with Italian auto designer Pininfarina.",

      "As the pace of sales growth slows, with car buyers questioning the affordability and convenience of switching to electrics, the going has been rough, and Foxconn has a long way to go before it can compete with industry leaders like BYD and Tesla.",
      "It was set to manufacture the Endurance battery EV truck at a former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which it acquired in 2023. Lordstown Motors Corp. then filed for bankruptcy.

      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has suggested that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s remarks about Canada becoming America\u2019s \u201c51st state\u201d is distracting the public from the harm that steep tariffs would have on U.S. consumers",
      "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Canada's outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday suggested that President-elect Donald Trump's remarks about Canada becoming America's \u201c51st state\u201d has distracted attention from the harm that steep tariffs would inflict on U.S. consumers.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports.",
      "\u201cThe 51st state, that\u2019s not going to happen,\" Trudeau said in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cBut people are talking about that, as opposed to talking about what impact 25% tariffs (has) on steel and aluminum coming into the United States.\"",
      "Trudeau told MSNBC: \"No American wants to pay 25% more for electricity or oil and gas coming in from Canada. That\u2019s something I think people need to pay a little more attention to.\u201d",
      "Trump has also said that if Canada merged with the U.S., taxes would decrease and there would be no tariffs.",
      "\u201cI know that as a successful negotiator he likes to keep people off balance,\" Trudeau said of Trump's threats to use economic force to turn Canada into the 51st state. Trump has also erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Canadian officials say that if Trump follows through with his threat of punishing tariffs, Canada would consider slapping retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, toilets and some steel products. Already during Trump's first term in the White House, Canada responded to Trump's tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum with its own on American products like bourbon, Harley Davidson motorcycles and playing cards.",
      "\u201cHe got elected to try and make life easier for all Americans, to support American workers,\u201d Trudeau said of Trump. \u201cThese (tariffs) are things that are going to hurt them.\u201d",
      "Trump said last week that the U.S doesn\u2019t need oil, or anything else, from Canada. But almost a quarter of the oil that the U.S. consumes each day comes from Canada. The energy-rich western province of Alberta exports 4.3 million barrels of oil a day to the U.S.",
      "Data from the United States Energy Information Administration shows that the U.S. consumes 20 million barrels a day, and produces about 13.2 million barrels a day.",
      "Canada, a founding partner of NATO and home to more than 40 million people, is also the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Trump has said that he would reconsider his tariff threat if Canada made improvements in managing security at the Canada-U.S. border, which he and his advisers see as a potential entry point for undocumented migrants.",
      "Trudeau has said that less than 1% of illegal immigrants and fentanyl cross into the U.S. from Canada.",
      "But after a meeting last November with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect\u2019s private club and residence in Florida, Trudeau announced an increase in spending on border security, expressing willingness to address Trump's concerns in hopes that he would reconsider his tariff threat.",
      "With the challenge of Trump\u2019s second administration looming and Trudeau's party trailing badly in the polls, the beleaguered Canadian prime minister announced his resignation last Monday. He will be replaced on March 9, when his Liberal party is set to pick a new leader."

      "The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial project from the city council.",
      "The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city's sports stadium district, the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not been released.",
      "The 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectator \u2014 which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays \u2014 did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there.",
      "The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move in to what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so livid right now I don\u2019t even know what to do,\u201d Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team\u2019s move, said, \u201cI feel as though I was used as a pawn.\u201d",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a \u201chistoric game-changing economic development project.\u201d Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.",
      "The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year\u2019s end so they could meet their target opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes.",
      "Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area.",
      "The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991."

      "But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes.",
      "Some now fear the most destructive fires in California\u2019s history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed.",
      "Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just go to my second home and stay there,'\" Santoro said.",
      "The landlord of their family's two-bedroom house with a pool had never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to affordably raise their daughters. Now, they're temporarily staying with a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much else.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to believe that you have nothing,\u201d Santoro said, through tears, thinking of her parents. \"Everything that they ever worked for was in that house.\u201d",
      "Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions. The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists, entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data.",
      "During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate.",
      "That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty.",
      "Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families.",

      "He is challenging state and federal officials to help all fire-affected communities fairly because \u201cyour $40 million home is no different than my $2 million home.\u201d",

      "Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners who might be tempted with offers for their property: \u201cI would tell them to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African-Americans.\"",
      "She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches.",

      "The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than 10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the congregation, paying the price.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too expensive for them,\u201d he said.",
      "The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography gear.",
      "She did not have renter's insurance. \u201cObviously now I\u2019m thinking about it. Wish I had it,\u201d she said.",

      "The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are far from contained, but they're already expected to be the costliest in U.S. history and among the worst natural disasters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are still raging, but already are projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The devastating blazes have killed at least 11 people and incinerated more than 12,000 structures since Tuesday, laying waste to entire neighborhoods once home to multimillion-dollar properties.",
      "While it's still too early for an accurate tally of the financial toll, the losses so far likely make the wildfires the costliest ever in the U.S., according to various estimates.",
      "A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.",
      "\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.",
      "AccuWeather factors in a multitude of variables in its estimates, including damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and vehicles, as well as immediate and long-term health care costs, lost wages and supply chain interruptions.",
      "The insurance broker Aon PLC also said Friday that the L.A. County wildfires will likely end up being the costliest in U.S. history, although it did not issue an estimate. Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.",
      "The L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.",
      "\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.",
      "In a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.",
      "While the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.",
      "That's far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.",
      "\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.",
      "It could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The second-guessing began before the bodies had been cleared from the debris of the deadly Bourbon Street truck attack.",
      "A law firm signed up survivors of what it called a \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d tragedy. Politicians parried blame for the latest mass-casualty event in New Orleans\u2019 infamous adult playground. And investigations targeted the ill-fated removal of the street's bollards, steel columns designed to restrict vehicle access.",
      "But as the city seeks to recover and beefs up security ahead of next month's Super Bowl and Carnival season, law enforcement and community leaders are confronting an existential question as old as the entertainment district: Can Bourbon Street be protected in a way that preserves its unique, round-the-clock revelry?",
      "\u201cOnce we start to hear what it\u2019s actually going to take to secure the French Quarter and the Mardi Gras parade routes, I don\u2019t know if this city is going to have an appetite for all that,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission watchdog group.",
      "\u201cIf we try to make New Orleans as secure as an airport, people aren't going to like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Disney World.\u201d",
      "Shock and grief have given way to finger-pointing over whether additional security could have stopped \u2014 or mitigated \u2014 the Islamic State group-inspired attack, which killed 14 people when Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a pickup through a New Year's crowd.",
      "In the difficult days since, proposals for new safety measures have ranged from banning vehicular traffic in the French Quarter to turning the historic neighborhood into a state park.",
      "Many locals who depend on tourism agree that something has to give.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just too wide open. It\u2019s too trustworthy down here,\u201d said Bryan Casey, 53, a native New Orleanian who has worked on Bourbon Street since the late 1990s and waits tables at Galatoire\u2019s, an upscale restaurant that opened in 1905. Casey and his colleagues wiped blood off the wall after the attack as bodies lay mangled in front of the establishment.",
      "Bourbon Street should have been made into a pedestrian mall long ago, Casey said: \u201cThere\u2019s people watching and they\u2019re going to get you, so you got to be careful.\u201d",
      "Much of the immediate focus has centered on the absence of the bollards, which had stopped working reliably and were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl.",
      "City leaders have been criticized for the timing of that project and failing to implement a suitable replacement during their repair. A lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of victims alleged the city \u201chad years of opportunities\u201d to patch up vulnerabilities.",
      "But a half dozen current and former law enforcement officials in Louisiana described the bollard issue as a red herring, saying that even if they had been functioning they may not have prevented the attack given how hell-bent Jabbar appeared on creating carnage.",
      "The broader safety conundrum is more complex, they said, given the quarter's dense, alcohol-fueled crowds and structural challenges inherent to an early 18th-century neighborhood built for horse-drawn buggies. Policing here is even more complicated in a city with notoriously high crime, a chronic shortage of officers and a new state law allowing permit-less concealed carry of firearms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place that has the same challenges for protecting people,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, a public safety consultant who served in the Louisiana State Police for 32 years, including as deputy superintendent.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in public safety don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we just can\u2019t guarantee that everybody going to the French Quarter is going to be safe,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff here, and we\u2019ve never, ever, found that balance.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s newly hired security consultant, William J. Bratton, a former New York City police commissioner, said he recognizes the importance of maintaining a festive atmosphere during carnival even as he works with city police to bolster security over the next few months.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I talked about is developing security provisions that don\u2019t change Mardi Gras, don\u2019t change the flavor of it, the excitement of it and the nature of it,\u201d Bratton said at a news conference this week. \u201cTo develop security protocols that don\u2019t become so intrusive, so disruptive.\u201d",
      "The New Year's attack was far from the first deadly vehicle incident on Bourbon Street.",
      "In 1972, one person died and 18 were injured when a teenager fleeing police in a stolen car crashed through metal barricades and sped down the thoroughfare at 70 mph (about 113 kph). Ten years later a man smashed through steel barricades and careened down nearly seven blocks, injuring at least 11. And in 1995, an intoxicated 63-year-old man drove a beer van through a crowd attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, killing one and injuring 38.",
      "More recent Bourbon Street tragedies have involved gun violence, including multiple fatal shootings last year. In 2014, a mass shooting killed a 21-year-old woman and wounded nine others, including a bystander shot through her cheek. Two years later a person was killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting.",
      "Many of those incidents prompted similar calls for change and accountability, raising questions about civil liberties and what, if anything, the city is willing to sacrifice in the name of public safety. City, state and federal law enforcement officials have offered varying solutions that critics have said were mere stopgaps, likening them to putting Band-Aids on a wound that has never quite healed.",
      "\u201cI was part of those conversations when we were looking to create a very robust security package, including metal detectors and infrared technology that could alert if something metal was in someone's clothing \u2014 none of that ever materialized,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a former head of New Orleans police who later became commissioner in Baltimore. \u201cThere are ways to prevent ramming attacks. There\u2019s not yet a way to prevent people from walking on Bourbon Street and doing bad things.\u201d",
      "Pedicab driver Jody \u201cCajun Queen\u201d Boudreaux, 65, said Bourbon Street has always embodied New Orleans' laissez-faire charm and she is not sure whether the city has the will to shore up its lax security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a target, clearly. They know we have holes, they know we are all scrambling and they also know that our vibe is \u2018Laissez les bons temps rouler\u2019\u201d she said, invoking the famous Cajun French saying that means, \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d \u201cI think it can be balanced, I truly do.\u201d",
      "Andrew Monteverde, co-vice president of the New Orleans Firefighters Association, said first responders and law enforcement deal with a raft of emergencies, from extinguishing fires to saving people in cardiac arrest.

      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Jakarta on Friday from Kuala Lumpur after meeting Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.",
      "He said he hopes to meet Trump at the earliest possible timing after his Jan. 20 inauguration, and plans to convey the importance of engaging with the region.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much interest Mr. Trump has in this region until I actually talk with him,\u201d Ishiba told reporters. \u201cI am convinced that having diplomatic engagement in this region is extremely important for Japan, and it is extremely important for America as well.\u201d",
      "Japan wants to send a message that its respect for a rules-based international order, in contrast to China\u2019s more aggressive behavior in claiming islands in the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety, makes it the best partner for Southeast Asian countries.",

      "COPANCA, Moldova -- Every time planned electrical outages are imposed on his village in southern Moldova, 73-year-old retiree Vasili Donici passes the time solving crosswords and puzzles in a room he illuminates using a small gas lamp.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard without electricity,\u201d said the former deputy school director who has stockpiled firewood to ensure he can use his wood burning stove in the room he shares with his wife to stay warm. \u201cThere\u2019s still gas \u2026 but it will end soon.\u201d",
      "The village of Copanca is situated just several kilometers across the de facto border from Moldova\u2019s separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left without heating and hot water after Russia halted gas supplies to the region on Jan. 1, over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies to Moldova.",
      "The decision by Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom, which came into effect a day after a gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine expired, halted gas supplies to Transnistria\u2019s gas-operated Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which provided a significant portion of Moldova\u2019s electricity.",
      "Copanca, like over a dozen other towns or villages administered by Moldovan authorities in the capital Chisinau but situated close to Transnistria, remains interconnected to the separatist region\u2019s Soviet-era energy infrastructure leaving them vulnerable amid the energy crisis.",
      "Planned daily electrical outages throughout Transnistria \u2014 which includes Copanca \u2014 are currently scheduled for four hours twice a day. While the Kuciurgan power plant transitioned to coal and has led to some unexpected outages, some residual gas remained in the pipes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get by with the electricity and gas shortages,\u201d said Donici. \u201cYesterday, we were without power for eight hours. Everyone is scratching their heads, figuring out what to do, so they don\u2019t freeze.\u201d",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, and has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy to destabilize the European Union candidate country. Russia has denied it is meddling in Moldova.",
      "Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean this week accused Russia of artificially creating an energy crisis to cause \u201cinstability in the region\u201d and \u201cto influence the results of the parliamentary elections\u201d that Moldova will hold later in 2025.",
      "\u201cWhat they want to achieve is to have a pro-Russian government in Moldova that would ultimately allow for the consolidation of the military capacity of Russia in the Transnistrian region, and correspondingly to use this leverage over Ukraine,\u201d Recean told journalists in a closed call with other senior officials on Monday.",
      "Transnistria \u2014 which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries \u2014 declared a state of emergency last month as the gas crisis loomed. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s roughly 350,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. Russia also bases about 1,500 troops in a so-called frozen conflict zone as \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a sprawling \u201chybrid war\u201d against it by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country\u2019s EU aspirations.",
      "Last month, Moldova\u2019s parliament also voted to impose a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, and fears that the situation could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where temperatures often drop to subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "The looming crisis also prompted Chisinau to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "Moldova's state energy company, Energocom, has increased electricity purchases from neighboring Romania to ensure capacity but are also more costly. Although a mild January is helping matters, energy prices have increased and the government has said it will provide help to offset bills.",
      "EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on the social media platform X this week that Russia \u201ccontinues to use gas as a weapon and once again Moldova is a target of its hybrid warfare,\" adding that \u201cThanks to EU support Moldova remains resilient and well-connected to European energy networks.\"",
      "Moldova\u2019s government this week announced plans to connect more than a dozen towns and villages under Chisinau\u2019s control that are interconnected with energy infrastructure in Transnistria to energy networks in Moldova.",
      "Afanasii Cutzari, the mayor of Copanca, says that so far the situation is manageable with planned electrical outages, but that if, or when, the gas runs out, \"then there will be problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere possible, people bought generators, but that\u2019s also not a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with a generator, someone needs to start it, a person who understands how to use it. It requires money, staff.\u201d",
      "Cutzari added that institutions in his village including a kindergarten, medical facilities, an ambulance, city hall and a post office would struggle if the gas ran out entirely. \u201cIt would be better if electricity and gas were always available,\u201d he said.",
      "Prime Minister Recean said that since the beginning of the energy crisis, his government in Chisinau has \u201cproposed organizing procurement for purchasing gas on behalf of the Transnistrian side,\" but that authorities in the region\u2019s de facto capital, Tiraspol, have refused.",
      "\u201cTiraspol is not autonomous in the decisions it makes,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThis crisis is induced by the Russian Federation in order to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and to use the Republic of Moldova in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "After visiting Copanca and other villages in a similar bind on Thursday, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said some kindergartens and schools have been provided with power generators, and that mayors can request help from Chisinau to supply firewood, wood-burning pellets, and generators.",
      "\u201cWe communicated with them that we are doing our best to provide them alternatives that provide light, water and heat for their families,\u201d she said, adding that Moldova is discussing \u201cpotential assistance\u201d with external partners.",
      "Carina Cazac, the owner of a convenience store in Copanca, said locals rushed to purchase essentials like oil and flour when the crisis hit, and that generators and oil lamps quickly sold out.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were stressed, and they started buying gas lamps,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's easier in the villages because most people have wood-burning stoves \u2026 others bought generators.\u201d",
      "But, she added, \u201cPrices have risen significantly, and not everyone can afford a generator.\"",

    "summary": "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
    "story": [
      "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.",
      "With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.",
      "A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won't pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.",
      "Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.",
      "\u201cThese are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don't realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should know about credit card defaults.",
      "There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn't pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card \u201cdelinquent\u201d and the borrower's credit scores can be damaged further.",
      "When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.",
      "\u201cThat's where you're going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,\u201d said Lupo.",
      "When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.",
      "The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it\u2019s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,\u201d said Sotir",
      "Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it\u2019s in the bank\u2019s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.",
      "It's best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.",
      "\u201cDo whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you're 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.",
      "Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.",
      "Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don't pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.",
      "Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.",
      "\u201cThere's not miracle solutions that once you've missed a payment, or you've gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can't just flip a switch,\" said Bandebo.",
      "If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.",
      "\u201cFor most people, it's really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it's going,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can\u2019t afford large and high-interest credit card balances.",
      "Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.",
      "If your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to resume payments, it\u2019s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.",

      "The report points out that China sees its own strong growth slowing slightly from 4.9% in 2024 to 4.8% in 2025 due to lower consumption and property-sector weaknesses that are failing to make up for public investment and export strength. This is forcing the government to enact policies to lift property markets, fight local government debt and boost demand.",

This has been especially true in Asia, where rapid economic growth and structural transformation have allowed countries such as China, India, and Indonesia to achieve poverty alleviation unprecedented in scale and scope,\u201d the report says.",

      "Michelsen's three booming service returns in the ninth game of the fourth set helped him earn a vital break against the 11th-seeded Tsitsipas and, after shaking off jitters on his own serve, he closed out for his first ever victory over a player ranked in the top 20.",
      "Gauff went into her opening round on a streak of winning 33 matches against players ranked outside the Top 50, dating to a loss to Kenin at Wimbledon 2023.",
      "It was tough going early, with Gauff converting an early break before Kenin got back on serve at 2-2, hitting deep ground strokes and getting good bounce off the hard court.",
      "But Gauff, who had five aces and four double-faults in her first two service games, lifted her tempo, started taking the ball earlier and won four of the next five games. She finished the match with 12 aces and nine double-faults, and saved seven of the eight breakpoints she faced. She also had 28 winners, including two rifling backhands on key points in the second set, and 13 unforced errors.",

      "The Bills methodically wore down the Broncos by scoring on six of their first seven drives in building a 31-7 lead in a game where they finished with a 23-minute edge in time of possession.",
      "And Buffalo didn\u2019t flinch after rookie Bo Nix capped Denver\u2019s five-play game-opening drive with a 43-yard touchdown pass to Troy Franklin.",
      "With Buffalo leading 13-7, Allen broke the game open with a 24-yard touchdown pass to sliding running back Ty Johnson in the back of the end zone on fourth-and-1 with 3:06 left in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been saying it all year long that Ty Johnson\u2019s the best third down back in football,\" Allen said. \"The things that he\u2019s able to do for us, the way we communicate, him in the pass game, blocking and running the ball. He does it all. I\u2019m so happy for him, so proud of him. He made a heck of a play. It was fourth down, no point in holding it and taking a sack there. They played man (coverage) and I just gave him a chance.\u201d",
      "On Buffalo\u2019s next possession, Allen completed a 55-yard pass to Curtis Samuel on the first snap of the fourth quarter.",
      "The five-time defending AFC East champion Bills advanced to the divisional round for a fifth straight postseason, and will face the third-seeded Baltimore Ravens next weekend.",

It\u2019s a great quarterback, obviously with Lamar and what he\u2019s able to do. He\u2019s one of the most dynamic, if not the most dynamic, quarterback in the league. He\u2019s so fun to watch. But I\u2019ll be watching their defense this week, so that\u2019s our focus.\u201d",

      "The seventh-seeded Broncos were outclassed in their first playoff appearance since their Super Bowl-winning season in 2015.",
      "Nix finished 13 of 22 for 144 yards in an outing where Denver punted four times and turned the ball over on downs twice.",
      "And the Broncos attacking defense was kept at bay by an Allen-led attack that was more than content in gaining small chunks of yards on lengthy time-consuming drives.",
      "The Broncos, who had an NFL-leading 63 sacks this seasons, sacked Allen just twice in an game where the Bills punted once.",
      "Trailing 7-3, Cook scored the go-ahead touchdown 2:03 into the second quarter to cap a 13-play, 81-yard drive. All three of Buffalo\u2019s first-half possessions featured 11 or more offensive snaps.",
      "The Broncos had little response in a first half that ended with Denver trailing 10-7 after Wil Lutz banked a 50-yard field-goal attempt off the right upright as time expired. The miss was Lutz\u2019s first since Week 10 when his 35-yard attempt was blocked by the Chiefs to preserve Kansas City\u2019s 16-14 win.",

      "Morant finished with just 12 points, but he had the tying basket with 54 seconds to go before his 11-footer for the lead. Desmond Bane had 21 points for Memphis, going 4 for 8 from 3-point range.",

      "There is just one member of the Big Three left in men's tennis",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- And then there was one: The Big Three is down to just Novak Djokovic, who stands alone from a golden generation of men\u2019s tennis now that Rafael Nadal has joined Roger Federer in retirement.",
      "The Australian Open, which started Sunday (Saturday night EST), is the first Grand Slam tournament of 2025 \u2014 and the first major championship to be held since Nadal, 38, played his final match at the Davis Cup in November. Federer's last match came in 2021, although he didn't announce he was done until 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s coming to an end, this era. It\u2019s tough for us. We grew up watching all of them. We saw them winning all the events,\u201d said Francisco Cer\u00fandolo, a 26-year-old from Argentina who\u2019s been ranked in the top 20. \u201cThen suddenly we started playing against them, sharing the locker room or practicing with them, having conversations with them.\u201d",
      "Djokovic has won 10 of his 24 Slam trophies at Melbourne Park since making his Grand Slam debut there in 2005, and was scheduled to begin his bid for Nos. 11 and 25 on Monday against 19-year-old Californian Nishesh Basavareddy, who recently announced he was leaving Stanford University to turn pro.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nice number of years that I\u2019ve been coming to Australia,\u201d Djokovic said, \u201cthe place where I had the greatest Grand Slam success.\u201d",
      "One big change for him as he seeks to become the first player in tennis history with 25 major singles titles: He is being coached, at least for this event, by his former on-court rival, Andy Murray, who retired as a player last August.",
      "\u201cWe thought we\u2019d give it a go and see if I can help,\u201d said Murray, who collected three major titles and two Olympic singles gold medals. \u201cNovak is not just one of the best tennis players of all-time. He\u2019s one of the best athletes of all-time.\"",
      "One other difference this time in Melbourne is that Djokovic was accompanied by his wife and two children.",
      "Basavareddy, roughly half the age of the 37-year-old Djokovic, grew up cheering for the Serb, as did plenty of other current players.",
      "\u201cHe's been my favorite player ever since I started watching (tennis), really,\u201d at about age 6 or 7, Basavareddy said. \u201cJust watched a lot of his matches and tried to learn from him.\u201d",
      "Some opted for Federer, a 20-time major champ, or Nadal, who won 22 Slam titles, as role models, of course.",
      "As time passes, inevitably, Djokovic will move on from his playing days. Just not yet.",
      "And even if he went without a Grand Slam triumph last season for the first time since 2017, the man many call \u201cNole\u201d did manage to collect the only piece of significant hardware missing from his tremendous resume, an Olympic singles gold medal.",
      "Aiming to rebound from what, for him, was a so-so season, hampered by a surgically repaired knee \u2014 the Paris Games success represented his only tournament victory \u2014 Djokovic cut his 2024 short, skipping the ATP Finals, and got to work in the offseason with Murray.",
      "Now folks inside and outside the sport wonder how much, exactly, the No. 7-seeded Djokovic plans to compete and what, exactly, he can continue to win.",
      "\u201cIt was a sad moment when Roger went, because the injuries had a lot to do with it. And Rafa also struggled with injuries. Nole is still quite fit, I have to say,\u201d said Wesley Koolhof, 35, who retired last year with one Grand Slam title in men's doubles and one in mixed doubles. \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to happen at one point that all the legends are going to retire. Nole is still going strong. Who knows how many years he has left in him?\u201d",
      "There is little doubt among his fellow players that Djokovic is not to be dismissed.",
      "\u201cFor me,\u201d said Alexander Zverev, a two-time major finalist who is seeded No. 2 in Australia, \u201che\u2019s still one of the best players in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked what he expects to see from Djokovic in Australia, Carlos Alcaraz smiled and replied: \u201cA really dangerous player.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf he goes to Australia ... hungry,\" said Alcaraz, who beat Djokovic in the past two Wimbledon finals and lost to him in the Olympic final, \"(he) is going to be one of the favorites to win.\u201d",

      "After Laine blasted a one-timer past Oettinger during a 5-on-3 power play late in the second, Benn responded with 2:26 left in the period, picking the top-left corner on an odd-man rush to quickly even the score at one.",
      "All nine of Laine\u2019s goals have come on the power play from the left circle. He joined Canadiens great Yvan Cournoyer as the only players to score each of their first nine goals in a season on the power play.",

      "The law that could ban TikTok is coming before the Supreme Court",
      "WASHINGTON -- The law that could ban TikTok is coming before the Supreme Court on Friday, with the justices largely holding the app's fate in their hands.",
      "The popular social media platform says the law violates the First Amendment and should be struck down.",
      "TikTok's parent company is based in China, and the U.S. government says that means it is a potential national security threat. Chinese authorities could force it to hand over sensitive data on the huge number of Americans who use it or could influence the spread of information on the platform, they say.",
      "An appeals court has upheld the law, which bans TikTok unless it's sold.",
      "The law is set to take effect Jan. 19, the day before a new term begins for President-elect Donald Trump, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform. The Republican says he wants to \u201csave TikTok.\"",
      "Here are some key things to know about the case:",
      "Not now, but the short-form video-sharing app could be shut down in less than two weeks if the Supreme Court upholds the law.",
      "Congress passed the measure with bipartisan support, and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed it into law in April.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawyers challenged the law in court, joined by users and content creators who say a ban would upend their livelihoods. TikTok says the national security concerns are based on inaccurate and hypothetical information.",
      "But a unanimous appeals court panel made up of judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents has upheld the law.",
      "The justices will issue a decision after arguments Friday, a lightning-fast movement by court standards.",
      "The conservative-majority court could drop clues about how it's leaning during oral arguments.",
      "TikTok lawyers have urged the justices to step in before the law takes effect, saying even a monthlong shutdown would cause the app to lose about one-third of its daily American users and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The court could quickly block the law from going into effect before issuing a final ruling, if at least five of the nine justices think it is unconstitutional.",
      "The law is to take effect Jan. 19, the day before Trump takes over as president.",
      "He took the unusual step of filing court documents asking the Supreme Court to put the law on hold so that he could negotiate a deal for the sale of TikTok after he takes office. His position marked the latest example of him inserting himself into national issues before he takes office. It also was a change from his last presidential term, when he wanted to ban it.",
      "Parent company ByteDance has previously said it has no plans to sell. Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, last month.",
      "Free-speech advocacy groups like the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged the court to block the law, saying the government hasn't shown credible evidence of harm and a ban would cause \u201cextraordinary disruption\u201d in Americans' lives.",
      "On the other side, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican former Senate leader, and a group of 22 states have filed briefs in support, arguing that the law protects free speech by safeguarding Americans' data and preventing the possible manipulation of information on the platform by Chinese authorities.",

      "La Nina, the flip side of the better-known El Nino, is an irregular rising of unusually cold water in a key part of the central equatorial Pacific that changes weather patterns worldwide.",
      "The last El Nino was declared finished last June, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters have been expecting La Nina for months. Its delayed arrival may have been influenced by the world's oceans being much warmer the last few years, said Michelle L'Heureux, head of NOAA's El Nino team.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally not clear why this La Nina is so late to form, and I have no doubt it\u2019s going to be a topic of a lot of research,\u201d L'Heureux said.",

      "In a collision between free speech and national security, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over the fate of TikTok, a digital age cultural phenomenon that roughly half the U.S. population uses for entertainment and information",
      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",

      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",

      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

      "Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",
      "\u201cDriver distraction is a big concern with visual displays in vehicles,\u201d said Reagan, who cautions that safety \u201cdoesn't always win out\u201d over what some companies determine is going to be \u201csexy and sell\u201d for consumers. Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately",
      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",

He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

    "summary": "A spate of alleged sabotage operations against undersea cables in the Baltic Sea has raised the prospect of a dangerous 2025 in NATO's northern theater.",
    "story": [
      "A spate of alleged underwater incidents has allied leaders on alert.",
      "LONDON -- A spate of alleged sabotage operations against undersea cables in the Baltic Sea has raised the prospect of a dangerous 2025 in NATO's northern theater, with allied leaders vowing closer surveillance of and tougher action against Russian- and Chinese-linked and other ships accused of nefarious efforts there.",
      "\"NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea,\" alliance chief Mark Rutte said in late December, after the last such instance of suspected sabotage, condemning \"any attacks on critical infrastructure.\"",
      "Rutte's commitment came after the most recent of three alleged sabotage operations in the Baltic Sea -- the damaging of the Estlink 2 power cable and four internet cables on Christmas Day. The Estlink 2 cable -- along with the Estlink 1 cable -- transfers electricity from Finland to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland.",
      "Finnish authorities quickly seized control of the ship suspected of the damage to the Estlink 2 cable -- the Eagle S. Though flagged in the Cook Islands, Finnish and European Union authorities said the Eagle S is part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" of tankers.",
      "On Jan. 3, Finnish authorities said repair work on the cable had begun and forensic samples would be taken as part of the investigation. Eight sailors were still under a travel ban as the probe continued, they added.",
      "NATO accuses Moscow of using tankers and other vessels to evade an international sanctions campaign on its fossil fuel exports prompted by the Kremlin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Atlantic Council described this \"shadow fleet\" as made up of ageing vessels often sailing without Western insurance, under opaque ownership and with regularly changing names and national registrations.",
      "Allied officials say some of the ailing ships are doubling as low-tech saboteur vessels.",
      "There may be as many as 1,400 ships in Russia's shadow fleet, according to the Windward maritime risk management firm. In December 2023, the energy cargo tracking company Vortexa calculated that 1,649 vessels had operated in what the Atlantic Council called the \"opaque market\" since January 2021, among them 1,089 carrying Russian crude oil.",
      "December's round of suspected sabotage prompted the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force -- a defensive regional bloc also including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden -- to launch an advanced AI-assisted reaction system to \"track potential threats to undersea infrastructure and monitor the Russian shadow fleet.\"",
      "A Jan. 14 meeting of NATO's Baltic states in Helsinki, meanwhile, will focus on \"measures required to secure the critical underwater infrastructure,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb said, and the \"strengthening of NATO's presence in the Baltic Sea and responding to the threat posed by Russia's shadow fleet.\"",
      "But allies face a major challenge in surveilling some 145,560 square miles of sea crisscrossed by as many as 4,000 ships per day.",
      "NATO tracking efforts are complicated by \"the sheer scale of the global commercial shipping sector and the fact that ownership structures are often quite opaque and complex,\" Sidharth Kaushal -- the sea power senior research fellow at the British Royal United Services Institute think tank -- told ABC News.",
      "\"A vessel may have multiple beneficial owners, its owners may not necessarily be from the state where it's registered and so actually attributing its activity to a given state becomes very difficult,\" he explained.",
      "Russian- and Chinese-linked vessels could play a role, but so could ships seemingly unconnected to Moscow or Beijing.",
      "\"The Russians have quite a broad spectrum of commercial vessels to choose from,\" Kaushal said. \"It's actually quite odd, in some ways, that they opted for a vessel that's associated with their shadow fleet.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is also relatively shallow. Its average depth is around 180 feet, compared to 312 feet in the North Sea and 4,900 feet in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Reaching cables or pipelines at the bottom of the Baltic is far easier than in the world's largest bodies of water, like the Atlantic Ocean with its average depth of 10,932 feet or the Pacific Ocean at 13,000 feet.",
      "\"In the Atlantic, for example, one has to use some pretty specialized equipment to go after undersea infrastructure,\" Kaushal said. In the Baltic, \"much simpler tools -- things like dragging an anchor -- are perfectly feasible means of attack.\"",
      "Guarding specific sites appears more realistic than identifying and surveilling all potential saboteurs. After the damage to Estlink 2 was reported, for example, Estonia said it dispatched naval vessels to protect Estlink 1.",
      "November's Bold Machina 2024 naval exercise in Italy also saw special forces divers test underwater sensors that NATO said could one day be used to protect underwater infrastructure.",
      "\"That's the only way to narrow the problem -- to focus on the critical infrastructure, rather than trying to achieve wide area surveillance over an area like the Baltic,\" Kaushal said.",
      "But NATO ships will still be limited in what action they can take to stop damage occurring. \"International freedom of navigation limits what navies can do on international waters, or even within their own exclusive economic zone,\" Kaushal said.",
      "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea does note that freedom of navigation may be challenged if a ship's passage \"is prejudicial to the peace, good order or security\" of coastal states.",
      "Historic agreements -- like the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables -- might also offer allies some latitude to act against suspect vessels.",
      "But challenging the passage of civilian shipping might have unwelcome consequences elsewhere. More muscular policing by NATO in the Baltic might encourage more assertive Chinese naval activity in the South China Sea, for example, or encourage more Iranian interdictions in the Persian Gulf.",
      "\"I think that's something that nations, particularly Western nations, have shied away from,\" Kaushal said.",
      "Local allied leaders, at least, appear to be clamoring for action. December's alleged attack is only the most recent of a spate of suspected sabotage incidents in the Baltic.",
      "In November, two intersecting submarine cables -- the BCS East-West Interlink connecting Lithuania to Sweden and the C-Lion1 fiber-optic cable connecting Germany to Finland -- were damaged in the Baltic Sea.",
      "Authorities suspected the Chinese-flagged cargo ship Yi Peng 3 of causing the damage. German, Swedish, Finnish and Danish officials boarded the ship off the Danish coast to inspect the vessel and question the crew. The Yi Peng 3 later set sail for Egypt.",
      "The first notable alleged cable sabotage incident in the Baltic Sea occurred in October 2023, when the Hong Kong-flagged Newnew Polar Bear vessel dragged its anchor across and damaged the Balticconnector gas pipeline linking Estonia and Finland. The nearby EE-S1 telecoms cable was also damaged.",
      "Investigators recovered a damaged ship's anchor from the seabed close to the damaged cables, with gouge marks on either side of the cables indicating its trajectory. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation said the Newnew Polar Bear was missing one of its anchors.",
      "In August, the Chinese government admitted that the vessel damaged the underwater infrastructure \"by accident,\" citing \"a strong storm.\"",
      "Even before ships began damaging cables in the Baltic region, the strategic sea -- referred to by some allied leaders as the \"NATO lake\" after the accession of Sweden and Finland to the alliance -- played host to covert operations apparently linked to Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines carrying natural gas from Russia to Germany were bombed in September 2022, marking the first notable incident of alleged sabotage in the Baltic Sea since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The pipelines had long been fiercely criticized by those in North America and Europe skeptical of Berlin's business dealings with Moscow, particularly leaders in Ukraine and the Baltic region who saw the pipelines as a plank of Russian hybrid warfare.",
      "Investigators are yet to establish who was responsible for the apparent sabotage to the pipelines, with a series of unconfirmed reports variously accusing Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine for the blasts. All have denied involvement.",
      "The Baltic, then, is already an important theater in the wider showdown between Russia and the West.",
      "The potential value for Russia is clear. With a handful of tankers, Moscow can force its NATO rivals to commit significant time and resources to guarding undersea infrastructure. When sabotage does occur, the Baltic's relative ease of access and the energy needs of regional nations might amplify its impact.",
      "\"The gas grid in the area is not particularly well integrated with the rest of the European grid,\" Kashaul noted. \"In much of Europe, this would be a bit of a nuisance, but in the Baltic Sea limited sabotage -- particularly to the gas pipelines -- can actually have some pretty disproportionate effects.\"",
      "European nations are highly sensitive to gas outages given the knock on economic -- and thus polling -- effects. Energy insecurity has been one of the major themes undermining the continent's response to Russia's war. Moscow has been keen to exploit this weak spot.",
      "But undersea escapades in the Baltic are not necessarily a free hit for Russia.",
      "Moscow's shadow operators have \"thus far enjoyed the freedom of navigation and the ability to move Russian oil at above price cap rates quite freely through NATO controlled waters,\" Kashaul said.",
      "If NATO nations can demonstrate that sanctions-busting vessels are involved in sabotage, the ghost ships might yet face more tangible retaliation.",
      "But that too could prompt escalation. A Danish intelligence report cited by Bloomberg, for example, noted that Russia may begin attaching military escorts to tankers transiting the Baltics.",
      "Such a development is \"quite plausible,\" Kashaul said, though noted the intensity of regular convoy operations may be beyond Russia's relatively small Baltic Fleet.",
      "A more militarized approach, he added, may also unsettle the non-Russian nationals crewing the vessels.",
      "\"Whether the people on those ships want to take the risk, even if the Russians are offering escorts and convoys, is another factor,\" Kashaul said.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 14:57:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Thousands of firefighters are battling at least four sprawling wildfires spread around the Los Angeles area as of Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "More than 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes.",
      "The Latino community is stepping into action to help support victims of the deadly wildfires in Los Angeles County.",
      "A multitude of Latino-owned businesses, organizations and community leaders throughout LA are offering resources, collecting donations for distribution and raising funds to provide relief for victims of several wildfires.",
      "There were four ongoing wildfires in the Los Angeles area as of Sunday: the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades area, the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, the Kenneth Fire that's straddling Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and the Hurst Fire in Sylmar, northwest of San Fernando.",
      "According to county officials, the Palisades Fire has destroyed more than 5,000 structures, while the Eaton Fire has damaged or destroyed an estimated 7,000 structures. More than 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes as the Santa Ana winds further exacerbate the situation. At least 16 fire-related deaths are being investigated by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, and many people are injured.",
      "In Los Angeles County, more than 4.8 million people are Hispanic or Latino, the latest U.S. Census data shows. With deep roots in the region, many Latinos have taken initiatives to mobilize the community and provide support.",
      "\"A friend of mine texted me telling me her house had burned down,\" Corissa Hernandez, a small business owner, told ABC News. \"I can't even imagine losing everything I've worked for in my personal space, so I immediately went to social media and just put out a call for action.\"",
      "After learning from local city leaders of the need for food, water and masks, Hernandez announced on social media that she was helping collect these items at Nativo HLP, the Mexican food restaurant she owns in Highland Park.",
      "That initial endeavor expanded tremendously because of the Latino community, according to Hernandez.",
      "\"It's such an honor and a humbling experience to see us all rally together for the most vulnerable amongst us, and it's just one of those moments where you just feel so proud to be part of LA and this community,\" she said.",
      "Hernandez is a board member of the Independent Hospitality Coalition, an advocacy group for bars and restaurants in Los Angeles. She said several restaurants and chefs who are part of that network responded to her call and began connecting her to shelters and evacuation centers in need of resources.",
      "Hernandez ultimately partnered with Guerilla Tacos DTLA and Guelaguetza, two other Mexican restaurants, to gather donations and deliver meals to people in need, she said. Together, they have created a central hub for all their operations and donations.",
      "\"I cannot take credit for what has evolved,\" Hernandez said. \"Since then, we've distributed collectively over 1,500 warm meals to evacuation centers and fire departments, hundreds of donations have gone out, and this has been in collaboration with my network.\"",
      "Latino community members in LA have gotten creative with their efforts to help provide mutual aid. Several taquerias are offering free tacos to first responders, L.A. Taco first reported, and Latinx Therapy, a mental health resource hub for Latinos, is organizing pro-bono providers to offer free therapy to Latino families impacted by the wildfires.",
      "Support from the Latino community is also coming from around the world. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Friday that firefighters from Mexico were arriving to join the \"more than 10,000 personnel already on the ground.\"",
      "\"California is deeply grateful for President @ClaudiaShein's support as we work to suppress the Los Angeles wildfires,\" Newsom posted on X.",
      "A spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, told ABC News a total of 70 firefighters from Mexico, including three information officers, arrived Saturday afternoon.",
      "Meanwhile, in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, Las Fotos Project, a nonprofit organization that mentors teenage girls and gender-expansive youth through photography, has created a bulletin-style database on its website where fire victims can describe their current needs and directly connect with people who can help them.",
      "\"We always say we find power in our stories and we find power in our communities. I really hope that this database can sustain people [and] support in the long term,\" Helen Alonzo Hurtado, social enterprise director for Las Fotos Project, told ABC News. \"Two to three weeks from now, as folks are getting settled in their temporary housing and they're realizing what it is that they need, they can put that there and then community members can respond.\"",
      "Alonzo Hurtado said that despite hosting community wellness days, Las Fotos Project is not an emergency response nonprofit and is not equipped to mobilize in such a capacity. Even so, she said, the group was motivated to help victims, including some of their own members who lost their homes and were displaced in the Eaton Fire.",
      "\"We're starting to see how many Latino families and Black families in Altadena were impacted,\" she said. \"When you think about that community, it's been home to a lot of working-class folks who have been able to build generational wealth, and that was just lost overnight.\"",
      "The Latino-led group hopes to make an impact with its database and further rally the community to help those in need.",
      "\"In our culture, we have the kermeses [parties to fundraise for low-income community members, usually for funerals], and we have these initiatives to come together to support one another.\" Alonzo Hurtado said. \"We're seeing so many people impacted and we're not just mobilizing for the Latino community, but for all the people affected.\"",

A report that was sent to the city a day prior outlined the fiscal impact of the contract and stated that it would cost approximately $76 million in the 2024 - 2025 fiscal year. This was to increase salaries and benefits for union members.",
      "On Dec. 17, 2024, the LA Fire Commission sent a report to Mayor Karen Bass by Fire Chief Kristin Crowley.

      "With the new contract approved, the budget for the fire department in Fiscal Year 2024 - 2025 increased from $819.6 million to $895.6 million. When compared to the previous year's budget (Fiscal Year 2023 - 2024), this current year's fire department budget in total is larger by $58.4 million. According to a document from the city administrative officer, the increase in this year's budget was approved specifically to meet salary and benefit increases included in the new union contract.",

      "NEW YORK -- On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of Hollywood\u2019s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los Angeles, Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cDen of Thieves 2: Pantera\u201d debuted atop the box office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the country\u2019s top box-office market.",
      "A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, \u201cDen of Thieves 2\u201d performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American theaters.",
      "Butler's films are becoming something of a regular feature in January. He also starred in \u201cPlane,\u201d which managed $32.1 million after launching on Jan. 13 in 2023.",
      "\u201cDen of Thieves 2,\u201d made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore. Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren\u2019t particularly good. But it counted as Lionsgate\u2019s first No.1 opening since \u201cThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d in November 2023.",
      "Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams movie \u201cBetter Man,\u201d one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton John (\u201cRocketman\u201d) or Elvis Presley (\u201cElvis\u201d), the British popstar is portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey\u2019s film.",

Reviews, however, have been very good for \u201cBetter Man.\u201d",

      "Third-seeded Coco Gauff has opened her Australian Open with a 6-3, 6-3 win over 2020 champion Sofia Kenin",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff had a little difficulty adjusting to the sun at one end of Rod Laver Arena and dropped an early service game but quickly settled into a rhythm to start her Australian Open a 6-3, 6-3 win Monday over 2020 champion Sofia Kenin.",
      "Third-seeded Gauff won the title at the WTA Finals last November and started this season by helping the U.S. to victory at the United Cup last week, a run that gives her a chance to move atop the rankings.",

      "\u201cI knew going in it was going to be difficult, but you know I\u2019m happy with how I played,\u201d she said of the 1-hour, 20-minute win over Kenin, who at No. 81 is a much tougher opponent than her ranking suggests.",
      "\u201cI mean (I) could serve better, but like on that side I was struggling to see the ball,\u201d Guaff said, pointing to one baseline on the main show court that was bathed in sun. \u201cSo I\u2019m just happy that I was able to manage through that.\u201d",
      "Another 20-year-old American, Alex Michelsen, produced the biggest win of his young career with a 7-5, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 first-round upset of 2023 Australian runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas.",
      "Michelsen's three booming service returns in the ninth game of the fourth set helped him earn a vital break against the 11th-seeded Tsitsipas and, after shaking off jitters on his own serve, he closed out for his first ever victory over a player ranked in the top 20.",
      "Gauff went into her opening round on a streak of winning 33 matches against players ranked outside the Top 50, dating to a loss to Kenin at Wimbledon 2023.",
      "It was tough going early, with Gauff converting an early break before Kenin got back on serve at 2-2, hitting deep ground strokes and getting good bounce off the hard court.",
      "But Gauff, who had five aces and four double-faults in her first two service games, lifted her tempo, started taking the ball earlier and won four of the next five games. She finished the match with 12 aces and nine double-faults, and saved seven of the eight breakpoints she faced. She also had 28 winners, including two rifling backhands on key points in the second set, and 13 unforced errors.",
      "The draw presented another tough trip to Australia for Kenin. It was the third straight year Kenin faced a Grand Slam champion in the first round in Australia, and her fourth consecutive first-round exit here.",
      "Guaff will next play Jodie Burrage of Britain. Also advancing from early matches were No. 12 Diana Shnaider, No. 23 Magdalena Frech and No. 25 Liudmila Samsonova.",
      "After a stop-start Day 1 on Sunday, including more than six hours of rain, Monday\u2019s packed program also includes matches for 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, defending champion Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, and women's No. 2 Iga Swiatek.",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 17:01:38 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department released an extensive report looking into one of the most destructive racial massacres in U.S. history.",
    "story": [
      "Over 300 Black residents were killed on May 31 and June 1 in 1921.",
      "The Justice Department provided new insight and chilling details about the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, describing the two-day raid that killed 300 Black residents and destroyed their businesses as a \"coordinated, military-style attack\" conducted by a white mob of over 10,000 people.",
      "The DOJ released a 126-page report Friday following a four-month investigation into the attacks, which took place between May 31 and June 1 in 1921. In addition to the murders and property destruction, victims' money and personal property were stolen, and they were not provided with any aid.",
      "The report concluded that the 1921 one-week investigation done by an agent of the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation, the precursor to the FBI, was unfounded as it did not include key details about the violence, the victims and the perpetrators and implied Black men were responsible for the massacre.",
      "\"Contrary to the agent's 1921 report, the situation did not 'spontaneously' grow out of control,\" the new report said. \"Rather, what had initially been sporadic and opportunistic violence became systematic, yielding a much more devastating result, due to coordinated efforts among white residents and law enforcement entities. Moreover, although the 1921 report asserts that the massacre (then called a riot) was not the result of 'racial feeling,' perpetrators of the massacre overtly expressed and acted upon racial bias.\"",
      "Investigation provides detailed timeline of violence",
      "At the time of the massacre, Tulsa was dubbed \"Black Wall Street\" due to the thriving businesses and community established by Black residents. However, white residents who lived in the city and nearby towns harbored a deep resentment, which built up in the years leading to the attack, the report said.",
      "Investigators from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \"spoke with survivors and with descendants of survivors, examined firsthand accounts of the massacre given by individuals who are now deceased, studied primary source materials, spoke to scholars of the massacre and reviewed legal pleadings, books, and scholarly articles relating to the massacre,\" according to the DOJ.",
      "The investigation determined the attack was triggered by an unfounded condemnation alleging 19-year-old Dick Rowland assaulted a white woman who operated an elevator he used. The department said this tactic was commonly used to justify violence against Black residents.",
      "After a local newspaper sensationalized the story, a mob of white Tulsans gathered outside the courthouse, demanding a lynching, according to the report.",
      "When a local sheriff called a group of Black World War I veterans to come to the courthouse to prevent the lynching, the white mob grew, and a shot rang out, the investigation found.",
      "The Tulsa police exacerbated the conflict by deputizing hundreds of white residents, many of whom were \"advocating for a lynching and had been drinking,\" the report said.",
      "\"Law enforcement officers helped organize these special deputies -- as well as other white Tulsans -- into the martial forces that ravaged Greenwood. Over the next several hours, they looted, burned, and destroyed 35 city blocks while Greenwood's residents tried desperately to defend their homes,\" the report said.",
      "\"Some Black residents were shot (or otherwise assaulted), and many were arrested or detained,\" it continued. \"Law enforcement actively participated in the destruction, disarming Black residents, confiscating their weapons, and detaining many in makeshift camps under armed guard.\"",
      "By the morning of June 1, the violence and arsons had become \"systematic.\"",
      "Left with nothing",
      "Although city officials offered to rebuild and help the victims, they not only failed to do so but put up barriers, the report said.",
      "\"White local leaders rejected outside aid, claiming they could handle the recovery, but then provided little to no financial support. Instead, claiming the area was best suited for industrial use, they imposed harsh new fire codes that priced residents out of the area, although a court later enjoined those provisions,\" the report said.",
      "\"Compounding the injustice, insurance companies denied Black residents of Greenwood compensation due to the 'riot clause' in their policies,\" it added. \"Legal attempts to hold the city accountable also failed. Black residents of Tulsa were left with no avenue for redress.\"",
      "No legal avenues left for justice",
      "Due to the statute of limitations and the fact that the perpetrators and almost all of the survivors and witnesses of the attack are long dead, the Justice Department cannot take any legal action for the crimes committed, the report concluded.",
      "\"The report recognizes that some may find the department's inability to prosecute a painful or dissatisfying outcome,\" the DOJ said in a statement. \"However, the review recognizes and documents the horrible events that occurred as well as the trauma and loss suffered by the residents of Greenwood.\"",
      "Family members of survivors said they were not given notice of report",
      "The DOJ said it would be meeting with Greenwood District officials, survivors and descendants of the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Tulsa civil rights community and other stakeholders to discuss the probe.",
      "DOJ members held a meeting at the Historic Vernon AME Church in Tulsa on Saturday to discuss the report.",
      "Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the family of two of the survivors, Lessie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher, however, expressed disappointment with the DOJ, claiming they were not given notice about the report.",
      "Solomon-Simmons said in a statement that he was only made aware of the report after his office saw news reports. Furthermore, he said his team was not told of Saturday's meeting at the church.",
      "\"Neither my legal team nor the massacre survivors will be able to attend due to time constraints amid our ongoing review and discussion with the DOJ,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Solomon-Simmons said he and his team will have further comment after they review the report and speak with the DOJ.",
      "The DOJ did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment about Solomon-Simmons' claims.",
      "ABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report."

    "story": [
      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",

      "Delta Air Lines fourth-quarter results topped analysts\u2019 expectations as travel demand was strong during the crucial holiday period",
      "Delta Air Lines topped profit and revenue expectations in the fourth quarter on strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Delta said Friday that travel demand picked up throughout the quarter. During November and December, the airline said that it saw four of the top 10 revenue days in its history and double-digit growth in cash bookings driven by both leisure and corporate travelers.",
      "\u201cAs we move into 2025, we expect strong demand for travel to continue, with consumers increasingly seeking the premium products and experiences that Delta provides,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said in a prepared statement on Friday.",
      "The company earned $843 million, or $1.29 per share. Per share earnings removing one-time expenses were $1.85, easily beating Wall Street projections of $1.76, according to industry analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.",
      "A year earlier, Delta earned $2.04 billion, or $3.16 per share.",
      "Delta hit the top end of its own forecast for the three months ended Dec. 3, having said that it would earn between $1.60 and $1.85 per share.",
      "Revenue rose to $15.56 billion, from $14.22 billion, last year, also topping Wall Street estimates of $14.99 billion.",
      "Total revenue per available seat mile climbed to $21.60 from $20.78 a year ago.",
      "Delta also benefited from a drop in fuel costs during the quarter. Fuel expense fell to $2.41 billion from $2.94 billion. The average fuel price per gallon declined to $2.36 from $3.01.",
      "Shares of Delta jumped more than 6% before the opening bell on Friday after saying that it now anticipates full-year earnings will be more than $7.35 per share, and between 70 cents and $1 in the first quarter.",
      "Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting full-year earnings of $6.11 per share and first-quarter earnings of 77 cents per share.",
      "Delta's strong quarter also pushed the shares of other airlines higher in premarket trading, with American Airlines up more than 4%, JetBlue rising about 2% and United Airlines climbing more than 5%.",
      "Among U.S. carriers, Delta scored the highest for on-time arrivals last year, aviation-data provider Cirium reported last week. That was despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July.",
      "Delta, based in Atlanta, achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide behind Aeromexico and Saudia, respectively. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

      "Ice Castles, which are both temporary art installations and tourist attractions, feature towers, tunnels, archways and caves, all created by growing, harvesting and arranging thousands of icicles and then blasting them with sprinklers.",
      "The company behind the displays has expanded since its first installation in 2011. This year it has operations in Utah, Minnesota, two locations in Colorado and New Hampshire, where the site includes a snow tubing hill and ice bar. After a mild winter last year, officials were thrilled that temperatures were cold enough to open earlier this season.",

      "As a winter storm brought biting cold and wet snow to the South, visitors to the New Hampshire castle bundled up to explore its twists and turns Friday.",

      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs knows she is outnumbered this legislative session, with Republicans having expanded their majorities in the statehouse after the last election.",
      "But the first-term governor sees room for bipartisan compromise as she looks to advance policies that have long been stymied under the GOP-controlled Legislature.",
      "While President-elect Donald Trump swept the battleground state, Hobbs noted in a recent interview with The Associated Press that Arizona voters also elected Democrat Ruben Gallego to the U.S. Senate, sending the message that they want their political leaders to work across the aisle to solve the thorniest of issues.",
      "\u201cThe issues we\u2019re facing \u2014 affordability for families, water security, protecting our border and keeping communities safe \u2014 those are not Republican or Democratic issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just Arizona issues that our elected leaders, myself included, need to work together to solve.\u201d",
      "Hobbs, who will be up for reelection next year, is expected to outline her priorities when she addresses lawmakers at the start of the session Monday.",
      "Here's a look at key policy areas:",
      "It was just two weeks after the November election when Hobbs visited the Arizona-Mexico border and vowed to work with Trump\u2019s administration on issues like stopping fentanyl trafficking. But she also acknowledged some families are worried about the president-elect's deportation threats.",
      "While not wanting to speculate, Hobbs says Arizona will focus its limited law enforcement resources on keeping violent criminals off the streets, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Arizona voters last year approved a measure empowering local police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the border, so it\u2019s unclear what new restrictions on immigration Republicans might push beyond ensuring adequate funding for law enforcement.",
      "Hobbs will look to pressure lawmakers again to plug regulatory holes to protect groundwater sources. Her calls last year to update the state's water laws failed to win legislative approval, leaving her administration to take executive action in December to curb unchecked pumping in one rural area.",
      "This time around, Hobbs is optimistic she can reach a deal with lawmakers on revamping groundwater regulations. In the absence of a pact, Hobbs says she won\u2019t hesitate to act unilaterally.",
      "The stakes are high as Arizona has grappled with long-term drought and needs to come up with a plan by the end of 2026 to manage its dwindling share of water from the over-tapped Colorado River.",
      "Reining in Arizona's school voucher program remains on Hobbs' wish list.",
      "The program, which started in 2011 for disabled children and expanded to all students in 2022, lets parents subsidize private-school tuition and other educational costs with public money.",
      "Hobbs and fellow Democrats have criticized the program, saying it contributes to a drain on the state's coffers. Republican lawmakers have championed the program as a cornerstone of the school choice movement. The budget approved by lawmakers last year after weeks of negotiations with Hobbs' office included only a small cut in spending for the program.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden spoke Sunday with relatives of three Americans the U.S. government is looking to bring home from Afghanistan, but it was unclear from the call if a deal to bring them back that is now on the table could be completed before the he leaves office next week.",
      "Biden's call with family members of Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmoud Habibi took place in the waning days of his administration as officials try to negotiate a deal that could bring them home in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "Corbett, who had lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the U.S.-backed government, was abducted by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip and Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country.",
      "Officials believe the Taliban is still holding both men as well as Habibi, an Afghan American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company and also went missing in 2022. The FBI has said that Habibi and his driver were taken along with 29 other employees of the company, but that all except for Habibi and other person have since been freed.",
      "The Taliban has denied that it has Habibi, complicating the talks with the U.S. government.",
      "On the call Sunday, Biden told the families that his administration would not trade Rahim, who has been held at Guantanamo since 2008, unless the Taliban releases Habibi, according to a statement from Habibi's brother, Ahmad Habibi.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden was very clear in telling us that he would not trade Rahim if the Taliban do not let my brother go,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe said he would not leave him behind. My family is very grateful that he is standing up for my brother.\u201d",
      "Ryan Fayhee, a lawyer acting on behalf of Corbett's relatives, said the family was grateful to Biden for the call but also implored him to act on the deal.",
      "\u201cA deal is now on the table and the decision to accept it \u2014 as imperfect as it may be \u2014 resides exclusively with the President,\u201d Fayhee said in a statement. \u201cHard decisions make great Presidents, and we hope and believe that President Biden will not let perfection be the enemy of the good when American lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "If a deal is not done before Jan. 20, it would fall to the incoming Trump administration to pick up negotiations, though it's unclear if officials would take a different approach when it comes to releasing a Guantanamo detainee the U.S. government has deemed a danger.",
      "Just 15 men remain at Guantanamo, down from a peak of nearly 800 under former President George W. Bush.",
      "Rahim is one of just three remaining detainees never charged but also never deemed safe for the U.S. to even consider transferring to other countries, as it has done with hundreds of other Muslim detainees brought to Guantanamo but never charged.",
      "The U.S. has described Rahim as a direct adviser, courier and operative for Osama bin Laden and other senior al-Qaida figures and a continuing threat to U.S. national security, despite never charging him or otherwise formally making public any evidence against Rahim in his 17 years at Guantanamo.",
      "Successive U.S. administrations have kept Rahim under wraps to a degree remarkable even for the military-run detention at Guantanamo.",
      "His attorney, James Connell, told a U.N. human rights commission recently that Rahim was being \u201csystematically silenced\u201d by the U.S. Connell claimed to the same panel that a U.S. official had told him \u201cevery word Rahim utters on any topic is classified on the basis of national security.\u201d",

      "Instead, the Pratas have remained in their family home of 27 years, which is somehow still standing amid widespread devastation from the Los Angeles wildfires, even as homes just over a block away burned. And as residents who did flee are kept away by police or military barricades, Prata and her dad have taken it upon themselves to check on their neighbors' homes.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sitting in these shelters. They\u2019re not sure whether their house survived or didn\u2019t survive,\u201d Prata said. \u201cOnce you know what the situation is, you have an ability to regroup and see what you\u2019re going to do moving forward.\u201d",
      "The fires raging around Los Angeles have consumed an area larger than San Francisco. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders. Since the fires first began Tuesday, they have burned more than 12,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and some vehicles, and killed at least 24 people. The White House said Saturday that the Department of Defense is making its nearby bases available for emergency shelter, including more than 1,000 available beds.",
      "Prata, a 25-year-old nursing student, had stopped at a hardware store on her way home from dinner Tuesday night when she saw the flames approaching the home she shares with her parents, two cats and a dog. She called her dad, then rushed home as many other people headed the other direction to evacuate.",
      "At the house, the Pratas frantically packed, in the dark once the power went out. But Vanessa's father, Aluizio Prata, who teaches electrical and computer engineering at the University of Southern California, didn't want to go. He didn't think the fire would reach them, but if it did, he wanted to stay and help fight it.",
      "They spent much of the night at a home up the street, carrying buckets of water, spraying the yard with a hose and stomping out embers before they spread in the powerful wind gusts.",
      "As the toll from the wildfires became clear, Vanessa Prata saw many people doing what they could to help those who lost their homes. They were donating food, clothing, household goods and pet supplies. Taco trucks from Los Angeles were offering free meals.",
      "Prata remained home, with her family occasionally running a borrowed generator to check the news and keep the freezer cold. She wanted to help, too. But there was little she could do from behind the barricade. If she left her neighborhood, she wouldn't be allowed back.",
      "So on Friday morning, Prata posted to an Altadena community group on Facebook, offering the one thing she could think of that would help.",
      "\u201cWe are more than happy to drive around and take a picture for any person who would like to see their home or, God forbid, what is left of their home,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The requests came pouring in \u2014 as many as 45 by Saturday morning. She and her dad set out on Friday, checking addresses written in a small notebook. They slowly make their way past fallen trees, downed wires and the husks of burned out cars.",
      "Of more than two dozen homes they visited Friday and Saturday, fewer than half were still standing. At the end of a cul-de-sac, reached only after getting out of the car and walking past fallen trees and utility poles, the ruins of one home were still smoldering. One person whose house burned sent her a photo of what it had looked like before the fire.",
      "\u201cThose are devastating, when you get to the person\u2019s house and it\u2019s gone and you know that you\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to break the news,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the burnt ashes and then they send (a photo of) the house, how beautiful it was prior. And it\u2019s, there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no words. You just say, you know, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I wish there was more that I could do for you.\u2019\u201d",

      "And she is gratified to be part of the community effort. So many volunteers showed up to help at nearby donation centers Saturday that some were being turned away.",

      "Even before powerful winds fueled fires that have scorched more than 10,000 homes and other structures across Los Angeles County since Tuesday, the region\u2019s urban trees were already in trouble",
      "LOS ANGELES -- People across Los Angeles have worked for years to increase the number of trees that shade the pavement, provide a respite for people and even clean some air pollution. They've confronted increasing drought, bad tree-trimming and objections from some neighbors who resent the leaves and sap. Now they wonder what January's fires have done to their efforts.",
      "Bryan Vejar, associate director of community forestry for TreePeople, an environmental nonprofit that works to expand tree equity across Los Angeles, said city arborists have shown him \u201csobering\u201d photographs of large trees knocked onto homes and parkways from the same powerful winds that sent fires out of control. Other images show scorched tree canopies.",
      "The Santa Ana winds damaged trees in TreePeople\u2019s primary focus areas of South Los Angeles, Watts and Inglewood, historically underserved neighborhoods with less shade.",
      "The air is still so bad that field crews cannot yet go out and work safely. When they do, he said, they expect to to find young trees snapped, broken or dried out.",
      "New trees are vulnerable, and volunteers often have to go out and water them for the first few years.",
      "\u201cEvents like this can greatly increase our mortality rates,\u201d Vejar said.",
      "Past fires and extreme winds have torn off many limbs and taken down trees, especially ones planted in narrow strips of land where there isn't room for much soil, Vejar said.",
      "When it\u2019s safe to conduct field assessments, urban tree experts will go out to inspect, re-stake and retie trees toppled by winds, and remove and replace those that were lost.",
      "Replanting trees in burned neighborhoods is harder now because of climate change, said Will Berleson, a professor at USC\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences and researcher with the university\u2019s Urban Trees Initiative. Even though many of the city\u2019s mature trees might only be 30 or 40 years old, they \u201cstarted growing at times when it was not as hot and didn\u2019t have these kinds of wet and dry fluctuations that we seem to be seeing now,\u201d he said.",
      "Some experts see tree losses as an opportunity to continue teaching Los Angeles residents about the place they live and what plants are the best fit, not necessarily the iconic ones of Hollywood movies. They would like to replace nonnative species like palms \u2014 which are more closely related to grasses \u2014 with trees that provide shade and can withstand extreme heat and drought.",
      "Aaron Thomas, director of urban forestry at the environmental nonprofit North East Trees, said trees such as the coast live oak are a good option. They are native to the region and are fire resilient \u2014 in fact, they need to burn to reproduce, he said.",
      "Thomas, who grew up in Altadena, has family members who lost homes to the Eaton Fire. His brother\u2019s home burned, but the five coast live oaks in his backyard survived.",
      "For him it's another reminder that cities need to think about how we rebuild in general and how we reforest communities with native flora: \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d",
      "But planting trees with climate-resilient features such as large canopies isn't always easy, and cities must consider community input when deciding what to plant. Trees that provide a lot of shade can make it difficult for drivers to see around corners, for instance. Where space is at a premium, sometimes there\u2019s just not enough room above or below ground to plant them.",
      "Berleson added that it will take a long time for neighborhoods to look like what they did before the fires.",
      "Trees provide myriad benefits. They clean the air and improve mental health. They capture stormwater runoff and replenish groundwater. And during heat waves that are getting hotter and deadlier, shade trees cool the air and urban surfaces.",
      "Vejar said his group knows there will be setbacks, but that is the reality we're living in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s climate change. It\u2019s water restrictions. It\u2019s extreme weather events,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so in the face of this, all we can do is continue to build and rebuild and steward our urban forests in such a way that makes it more resilient in the face of these extreme weather events.\u201d",

      "Firefighters scrambled to make further progress against wildfires that have killed at least 24 people in the Los Angeles area as forecasters again warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Firefighters scrambled Sunday to make further progress against wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed 24 people in the Los Angeles area as forecasters again warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week. At least 16 people were missing, and authorities said that number was expected to rise.",
      "The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, said weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have really strong gusty Santa Ana winds, a very dry atmosphere and still very dry brush, so we still have some very critical fire weather conditions out there,\u201d Thompson said at a community meeting Saturday night.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said 70 additional water trucks arrived to help firefighters fend off flames spread by renewed gusts. \u201cWe are prepared for the upcoming wind event,\u201d Marrone said. Fire retardant dropped by aircraft Sunday will act as a barrier along hillsides, officials said.",
      "Fierce Santa Anas have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires sparked last week into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around the city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months.",
      "Twelve people were missing within the Eaton Fire zone and four were missing from the Palisades Fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Luna added that \u201cdozens\u201d more reports might have come in Sunday morning and investigators were reconciling whether some of the missing might be among the dead. There are no children among those reported missing, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 24 over the weekend. Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 16 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office said in a statement Sunday evening.",
      "Officials said they expected that figure to increase as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing.",
      "Officials also were building an online database to allow evacuated residents to see if their homes were damaged or destroyed. In the meantime, LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from scorched neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cThere are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public,\" Crowley said at a Sunday morning briefing. \u201cThere\u2019s no power, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures.\u201d",
      "Officials warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials.",
      "About 150,000 people in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, with more than 700 residents taking refuge in nine shelters, Luna said. Officials said most of the orders in the Palisades area were unlikely to be lifted before the red flag warnings expire Wednesday evening.",
      "\u201cPlease rest assured that first thing Thursday we will begin talking about repopulation,\u201d Marrone said.",
      "By Sunday morning, Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades Fire was 11% contained and containment on the Eaton Fire reached 27%. Those two blazes accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers).",
      "Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes nearly 1,400 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico.",
      "Minimal growth was expected Sunday for the Eaton Fire \u201cwith continued smoldering and creeping\u201d of flames, an LA County Fire Department incident report said. Most evacuation orders for the area have been lifted.",
      "After a fierce battle Saturday, firefighters managed to fight back flames in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities near Pacific Palisades not far from the coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill.",
      "The fire ran through chaparral-covered hillsides and also briefly threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley.",
      "Looting continues to be a concern, with authorities reporting more arrests as the devastation grows. Michael Lorenz, a captain with the Los Angeles Police Department, said seven people have been arrested in recent days, with two suspects \u201cposing as firefighters coming and in and out of houses.\u201d",
      "Asked exactly how many looters have been arrested, Lorenz said he couldn\u2019t give a precise number but that officers were detaining about 10 people a day. California National Guard troops arrived Friday to help guard properties.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on X Saturday that \u201cCalifornia will NOT allow for looting.\u201d",
      "The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 structures.",
      "No cause has been determined for the largest fires and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation's costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion.",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the fires could end up being the worst natural disaster in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cI think it will be in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope,\u201d he said.",
      "Along with crews from other states and Mexico, hundreds of inmates from California\u2019s prison system were also helping firefighting efforts. Nearly 950 incarcerated firefighters were dispatched \u201cto cut fire lines and remove fuel to slow fire spread,\u201d according to an update from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Though the state has long relied on prison labor to fight fires, the practice is controversial as the inmates are paid little for dangerous and difficult work. Inmates are paid up to roughly $10.24 each day, with additional money for 24-hour shifts, according to the corrections department.",
      "Volunteers overflowed donation centers and some had to be turned away at locations including the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where people who lost their homes sifted through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods.",
      "Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed.",
      "\u201cEverything is gone,\u201d he said, speaking in Spanish. \"All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing.\u201d",
      "Newsom issued an executive order Sunday aimed at fast-tracking the rebuilding of destroyed property by suspending some environmental regulations and ensuring that property tax assessments are not increased.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to let people know that we have their back,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away because we want you to come back, rebuild, and rebuild with higher quality building standards, more modern standards. We want to make sure that the associated costs with that are not disproportionate, especially in a middle-class community like this.\u201d",
      "The White House said as of Sunday more than 24,000 people have registered for federal assistance made available by President Joe Biden's major disaster declaration last Wednesday.",
      "LA Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday that she has spoken with members of the incoming presidential administration and said she expects Donald Trump will come visit the devastated region.",
      "Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun.",
      "Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.",
      "Crowley, the LA fire chief, said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water.",

      "The wildfires tearing through Los Angeles have taken lives and thousands of homes",
      "For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County\u2019s Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both her and her daughter during the pandemic.",
      "Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires around Los Angeles.",
      "Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid\u2019s adventure group called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 190-acre (77-hectare) preserve near Altadena, now destroyed by fire.",
      "Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn't stop talking about it for days.",
      "For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.",
      "They have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Orde\u00f1ana's children attend.",
      "\u201cThe community has been devastated by the fire,\u201d said Orde\u00f1ana, senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their homes. And we don\u2019t know the impact to school staff, like their teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost their homes.\u201d",
      "Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been affected by the end of the week but it's not clear when the air quality there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Orde\u00f1ana, who was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that gained fame under the name P-22.",
      "Orde\u00f1ana said his family was able to connect with some other families from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures already extending through next week.",
      "All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation\u2019s second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle School.",
      "The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be closed Monday.",
      "During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen. She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but her daughter\u2019s outdoor education helped her better understand the value of stepping away from the grind.",
      "Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although it\u2019s unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like Eaton Canyon.",
      "\u201cThe nature center is gone,\u201d Richard Smart, superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. \u201cThe wildflowers, the shrubs are gone.\u201d The park hosted dozens of school field trips a year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited yearly.",
      "\u201cTeachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was nearby. And it was a place to see nature \u2014 wild nature but also in a friendly, safe environment,\u201d he said.",
      "Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing, he said.",
      "\u201cFor many of the local school districts, we truly were in their backyard, and now they won\u2019t be able to use it for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable.\u201d",
      "Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural History Museum and author of \u201cWild L.A,\u201d a field trip and nature guidebook.",
      "A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.",
      "\u201cFor children\u2019s cognitive development, time in nature and time spent connecting with nature is so important,\" she said. Outdoor spaces also can help children learn how to develop relationships through connections with animals, understand orientation through space by following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on wildlife.",
      "\u201cA lot of the places that we\u2019re talking about are really popular with homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips, certainly places like Eaton Canyon,\" said Greg Pauly, co-author of \u201cWild L.A.\u201d and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. \"I do think it\u2019s safe to say that people are going to continue to be interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field trip destination in the future. But it\u2019s certainly going to be a while before that happens.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the reality of modern Southern California,\" he said. \u201cFire changes the landscape and people\u2019s lives shockingly often.\u201d",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, many elected officials in Republican and Democratic states are preparing to either aid or oppose his policies",
      "Do you live in a red state, a blue state, or one where Republicans and Democrats share power?",
      "Your answer might provide the best indicator of what to expect from your governor and state lawmakers as President-elect Donald Trump takes office and legislatures convene.",
      "In many cases, political party identification has come to define public policy, percolating from the nation\u2019s capital down to the 50 statehouses.",
      "Many Republican state officials are aligning with Trump's policies by pledging to help him crack down on illegal immigration, for example. Some Democratic state officials are mounting a resistance movement, looking for ways to shield their states from potential federal policies restricting abortion and transgender rights, among other things. Some prominent Democratic governors, meanwhile, have taken a more conciliatory approach in an effort to forge a working relationship with the new administration.",
      "Here's a look at what to expect in some policy areas:",
      "Governors and lawmakers in red states are lining up behind Trump's pledge to crack down on illegal immigration and deport many who are living in the U.S. illegally. A joint statement from 26 Republican governors said they \u201cstand ready to utilize every tool at our disposal \u2014 whether through state law enforcement or the National Guard \u2014 to support President Trump in this vital mission.\u201d",
      "Republican lawmakers in a growing number of states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring a recent Texas law that has been placed on hold while courts consider whether it unconstitutionally usurps federal authority. One bill in Missouri would offer a $1,000 reward to informants who tip off authorities about people in the country illegally and allow private bounty hunters to find and detain them.",
      "Governors in some blue states are taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump's immigration plans, willing to cooperate on deporting people who commit crimes but not in using the National Guard for widespread roundups of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Other Democratic-led jurisdictions are bracing for a showdown. The California Legislature has convened a special session to erect shields against Trump's policies on immigration and other issues.",
      "Most U.S. abortions are carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures, and that is where the current abortion fight is focused.",
      "At least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have bills introduced aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing a New York doctor, claiming she wrongly prescribed via telehealth and sent pills to a Texas woman, even though a New York law aims to protect such prescriptions.",
      "And the Republican attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are in court trying to roll back federal approvals of one of the pills usually used in abortion.",
      "Several efforts to expand the use of public money to pay for kids to attend private school suffered high-profile defeats in the November elections, including in Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado.",
      "But Trump\u2019s victory is seen as a boon for such efforts, which in recent years have exploded in popularity. A dozen states, almost all red, have programs allowing any student to apply for government funding for private education, including at religious schools.",
      "With Trump in office, states could see more incentives such as block grants or tax benefits to adopt or expand models like vouchers, which subsidize private school tuition for families.

      "Many conservative states also are pushing to bring Christianity into public K-12 education through moves such as requiring schools to teach the Bible and post the Ten Commandments. Trump has promised to promote prayer and Bible reading in schools, with current courts more amenable to religion in the public sphere, including schools.",

      "In his campaign last year, Trump leaned into attacks on transgender rights, suggesting a looming shift in federal policy.",

The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century because it prevents tooth decay.",

Wyoming has a bill that would impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 on a business or entity that gets state or federal money if found to discriminate based on whether someone is wearing a mask, has had a COVID-19 vaccination or has been tested for COVID-19.",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 18:50:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Kristin Crowley was elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of department turmoil",
    "story": [
      "Kristin Crowley was elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of department turmoil",
      "Kristin Crowley was elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of turmoil in a department consumed by complaints of rampant hazing, harassment and discrimination among its 3,400-member ranks. As a career firefighter, she was portrayed by the then-mayor as a stabilizing force.",
      "Three years later, the mood between Crowley and City Hall has changed.",
      "The wildfire in Pacific Palisades that has burned more than 5,000 structures to become the most destructive in city history has put leaders on the defensive and led Crowley to engage in a public spat with Mayor Karen Bass over resources even as the battle against flames continues across the Los Angeles area.",
      "Crowley publicly criticized the city Friday for budget cuts that she said have made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs at a time when they are seeing more calls. She also cast blame on the city for water running out Tuesday when about 20% of the hydrants tapped to fight the Palisades fire went dry.",
      "\u201cI'm not a politician, I\u2019m a public servant. It\u2019s my job as the fire chief for Los Angeles city fire dept to make sure our firefighters have exactly what they need to do their jobs,\u201d she told CNN.",
      "Her comments and perceived falling-out with Bass prompted so much speculation about her job security that the union issued a statement Friday assuring rank-and-file members that she had not been fired.",
      "The following day the mayor sought to tamp down the tension.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear about something: The fire chief and I are focused on fighting these fires and saving lives, and any differences that we might have will be worked out in private,\u201d Bass said at a news conference. \u201cBut right now our first and most important obligation to Angelenos is to get through this crisis.\u201d",
      "This followed several days of Crowley getting swept into the national political fray over diversity, equity and inclusion policies that conservatives believe have gone too far in American institutions. Crowley, who is openly gay and the city\u2019s first female fire chief, has made diversifying the overwhelmingly male department a priority.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing (was) largely preventable,\u201d talk show host Megyn Kelly said on her show. \u201cLA\u2019s fire chief has made not filling the fire hydrants top priority, but diversity.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no evidence that Crowley\u2019s efforts to diversify the department have hampered the fight. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is in charge of providing water for the hydrants, and its leaders have said they were overwhelmed by the intense demand on a municipal system not designed to fight wildfires, particularly as firefighting aircraft was grounded. Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered an investigation into what happened, and Crowley herself added to the criticism.",
      "\u201cWhen a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there's going to be water,\u201d she said during a local news interview.",
      "Philadelphia Managing Director Adam K. Thiel, who previously served as that city\u2019s fire commissioner, suggested that people reserve judgment until the fires can be investigated. He noted that firefighters cannot control the weather, a key factor in battling wildfires.",
      "\u201cFirefighting, to a regular person, probably appears to be a relatively simple process of putting water on a fire,\u201d said Thiel, who knows Crowley and praised her experience. \u201cIn reality every firefighting operation, in any environment, is inherently volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti appointed Crowley to the job amid complaints about a frat house culture in the department that was sometimes hostile to women and minorities. Several lawsuits alleged hazing and harassment, and federal investigators found evidence of discrimination.",
      "At the time Crowley was sworn in, women accounted for just 3.5 percent of the uniformed membership, a figure that\u2019s not unusual for a department. A survey found that half the uniformed women in the department \u2014 along with 40% of Blacks, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders \u2014 felt harassment was a problem.",
      "Crowley, whose wife is a retired firefighter, told the Los Angeles Times in 2022 that she planned to ensure all of employees \u201ccome to work and feel safe and feel heard.\u201d",
      "Two years later, she was facing budget cuts that she warned could hamper the department's ability to respond to emergencies, including wildfires. She highlighted the elimination of civilian positions and $7 million in overtime pay.",
      "The reduction in overtime has limited the department\u2019s ability to prepare and train for \u201clarge scale emergencies,\u201d such as wildfires and earthquakes, Crowley said, and programs like air operations. The department has also lost mechanics, leading to delays in repairing the vehicle fleet, she said.",
      "Other city officials say the department's budget was later boosted, but it's unclear how much of that went to firefighting resources. Bass has said the department has the resources needed to do its job and she will address specifics once the crisis subsides.",
      "Crowley, who grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, came to firefighting after what she called \u201ca really unique journey.\u201d",
      "A high school and college athlete, she studied biology at Saint Mary\u2019s College in Notre Dame, Indiana, with plans to become an orthopedic surgeon. Two weeks after graduation, she moved to California.",
      "A stint as a paramedic changed her career path. She did an internship with the fire department and was hooked.",
      "\u201cThat was it,\u201d she told WBAY-TV in Green Bay in March 2022. \u201cWithin a few seconds of me entering into the fire station, it was just such a wonderful connection to what I had being a student-athlete for the majority of my life, and I tell you, it was a perfect fit.\u201d",
      "Crowley has now been with the department for a quarter century, serving in nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief. Garcetti had described Crowley as not only a trailblazer but the most qualified person.",
      "\u201cThe protection of our city first and foremost has to go to the human being who is best prepared to lead. But let me be clear, that is Kristin Crowley,\u201d he said.",

      "A Florida state agency is suing a company owned by the family of U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A Florida state agency is suing a company owned by the family of U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, saying the company overcharged the state by nearly $5.8 million for work done during the pandemic and won't give the money back.",
      "The lawsuit comes at the same time that a congressional ethics investigation concluded the South Florida Democrat may have violated U.S. House rules and federal law with her campaign activities and how she has used her congressional office. The House Ethics Committee hasn't acted on the report.",
      "The lawsuit was filed Dec. 30 in state court in Tallahassee by the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The agency claims that it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services, based in Miramar, after hiring Trinity in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations. The agency says it discovered the problem after a single $5 million overpayment drew attention.",
      "\u201cTrinity took advantage of the state of emergency the entire country was encountering due to the COVID-19 pandemic and knowingly processed an invoice more than 100 times its typical invoice size,\" the suit says.",
      "Lawyer Gabriel Imperato, who represents the company, declined to comment on the lawsuit when contacted by the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time. She was elected to Congress in 2022 in the 20th District representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties in a special election after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. Cherfilus-McCormick won the primary in the heavily Democratic district by five votes. She was reelected without opposition in November.",
      "In a report from the Office of Congressional Ethics released on Jan. 2, the agency found that Cherfilus-McCormick's income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services. The House Ethics Committee hasn't acted on the report.",
      "During the 2021-2022 campaign cycle, Cherfilus-McCormick reported loaning her campaign millions of dollars.",
      "The ethics report found that there was reason to believe that Cherfilus-McCormick made nearly $270,000 in unreported payments to a Florida state political action committee in 2021 and 2022 for campaign work. The report found that Cherfilus-McCormick may have also improperly accepted in-kind contributions.",
      "The report also found that Mark Goodrich, whom the report described as Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign manager, improperly produced videos and mailers that Cherfilus-McCormick sent out using her congressional office.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick has said the report doesn't mean she has done anything wrong."

      "After he was found in contempt twice in one week, Rudy Giuliani faces another treacherous week ahead at a trial to determine whether his Florida condominium and three World Series rings must be turned over to two Georgia election workers",
      "NEW YORK -- After he was found in contempt twice in one week, Rudy Giuliani faces another potentially treacherous week ahead at a trial to determine whether his Florida condominium and three World Series rings must be turned over to two Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation award against him.",
      "The former New York City mayor was found in contempt on Friday by a Washington judge for repeating false claims that the workers corruptly counted votes in the 2020 presidential election. Last Monday, a New York judge found him in contempt for failing to adequately turn over evidence about his assets.",
      "On Thursday, Giuliani, 80, faces trial in New York over whether he can keep his Palm Beach, Florida, condominium, which he asserts he established as his permanent residence a year ago, and whether he must turn over three World Series rings that he says he gave to his son in 2018.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman, who will preside over the juryless trial in Manhattan federal court, is the same jurist who found Giuliani in contempt last Monday.",
      "With his contempt order, Liman made rulings setting Giuliani back in the upcoming trial. He said Giuliani cannot offer testimony about texts or emails to show that he moved his residence to Florida since he failed to turn over any texts or emails as part of the pretrial exchange of evidence between lawyers.",
      "Liman said he can also make adverse inferences about \u201cgaps\u201d in evidence resulting from Giuliani\u2019s failure to turn over materials, including by rejecting any claims that Giuliani changed his professional services, such as doctors and lawyers, to individuals practicing in Florida after Jan. 1, 2024.",
      "Giuliani has conceded that he sometimes did not turn over everything requested in the case because he believed what was being sought was overly broad, inappropriate or even a \u201ctrap\u201d set by lawyers for the plaintiffs.",
      "A request for comment Saturday was sent to a spokesperson for the former private attorney to President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "At a November hearing, Giuliani said he was \u201cnot impoverished,\u201d but his assets were tied up because of multiple legal proceedings he faces in several states.",
      "Liman also issued an order several days ago asking all sides to describe whether the World Series rings Giuliani purchased from the New York Yankees should be stored with the court for safekeeping until it can be decided who will get them.",
      "Lawyers for Andrew Giuliani said the rings are safely located in the bedroom closet of his New York City residence in a doorman building.",
      "The judge raised the possibility of the court keeping the rings after Giuliani testified last Monday that he doesn't know what happened to a valuable signed Joe DiMaggio baseball jersey after he last saw it at his Manhattan apartment about four months ago.",
      "Following the testimony, lawyers for the election workers submitted written arguments to refute the claims that Giuliani gave the rings to his son in 2018. They noted, for instance, that Giuliani's bankruptcy submission in 2023 listed the rings among his property.",
      "The Florida property and World Series rings are the primary assets still in dispute from a portfolio of Giuliani assets that was estimated to exceed $10 million. The Palm Beach condominium is believed to be worth more than $3 million.",
      "He has already given up assets including a New York City apartment worth about $5 million, a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and numerous luxury watches and other belongings.",
      "The Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, won the defamation judgment against Giuliani after saying his lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives."

      "City leaders have been criticized for the timing of that project and failing to implement a suitable replacement during their repair. A lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of victims alleged the city \u201chad years of opportunities\u201d to patch up vulnerabilities.",
      "But a half dozen current and former law enforcement officials in Louisiana described the bollard issue as a red herring, saying that even if they had been functioning they may not have prevented the attack given how hell-bent Jabbar appeared on creating carnage.",
      "The broader safety conundrum is more complex, they said, given the quarter's dense, alcohol-fueled crowds and structural challenges inherent to an early 18th-century neighborhood built for horse-drawn buggies. Policing here is even more complicated in a city with notoriously high crime, a chronic shortage of officers and a new state law allowing permit-less concealed carry of firearms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place that has the same challenges for protecting people,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, a public safety consultant who served in the Louisiana State Police for 32 years, including as deputy superintendent.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in public safety don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we just can\u2019t guarantee that everybody going to the French Quarter is going to be safe,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff here, and we\u2019ve never, ever, found that balance.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s newly hired security consultant, William J. Bratton, a former New York City police commissioner, said he recognizes the importance of maintaining a festive atmosphere during carnival even as he works with city police to bolster security over the next few months.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I talked about is developing security provisions that don\u2019t change Mardi Gras, don\u2019t change the flavor of it, the excitement of it and the nature of it,\u201d Bratton said at a news conference this week. \u201cTo develop security protocols that don\u2019t become so intrusive, so disruptive.\u201d",
      "The New Year's attack was far from the first deadly vehicle incident on Bourbon Street.",
      "In 1972, one person died and 18 were injured when a teenager fleeing police in a stolen car crashed through metal barricades and sped down the thoroughfare at 70 mph (about 113 kph). Ten years later a man smashed through steel barricades and careened down nearly seven blocks, injuring at least 11. And in 1995, an intoxicated 63-year-old man drove a beer van through a crowd attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, killing one and injuring 38.",
      "More recent Bourbon Street tragedies have involved gun violence, including multiple fatal shootings last year. In 2014, a mass shooting killed a 21-year-old woman and wounded nine others, including a bystander shot through her cheek. Two years later a person was killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting.",
      "Many of those incidents prompted similar calls for change and accountability, raising questions about civil liberties and what, if anything, the city is willing to sacrifice in the name of public safety. City, state and federal law enforcement officials have offered varying solutions that critics have said were mere stopgaps, likening them to putting Band-Aids on a wound that has never quite healed.",
      "\u201cI was part of those conversations when we were looking to create a very robust security package, including metal detectors and infrared technology that could alert if something metal was in someone's clothing \u2014 none of that ever materialized,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a former head of New Orleans police who later became commissioner in Baltimore. \u201cThere are ways to prevent ramming attacks. There\u2019s not yet a way to prevent people from walking on Bourbon Street and doing bad things.\u201d",
      "Pedicab driver Jody \u201cCajun Queen\u201d Boudreaux, 65, said Bourbon Street has always embodied New Orleans' laissez-faire charm and she is not sure whether the city has the will to shore up its lax security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a target, clearly. They know we have holes, they know we are all scrambling and they also know that our vibe is \u2018Laissez les bons temps rouler\u2019\u201d she said, invoking the famous Cajun French saying that means, \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d \u201cI think it can be balanced, I truly do.\u201d",
      "Andrew Monteverde, co-vice president of the New Orleans Firefighters Association, said first responders and law enforcement deal with a raft of emergencies, from extinguishing fires to saving people in cardiac arrest. The more that limited resources are dedicated to one part of the city, he added, the less is available to deal for elsewhere.",
      "\u201cCould you possibly make the French Quarter so secure that you couldn\u2019t even spit on the sidewalk?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, but then what would you trade off?\u201d",
      "At The Beach on Bourbon Street, where workers screen clubgoers at every entrance with handheld metal detectors, general manager Woody Ryder has become inured to the frequent shootings after working there for seven years. \u201cThere's crazy people out there,\u201d he said.",
      "But the recent attack has made him uneasy. Ryder and his staff are still recovering from witnessing what he and others likened to a \u201cwar zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe city has already failed us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant as soon as I turn on Bourbon Street.\u201d",

      "An increasing number of Democrats are questioning whether their party\u2019s commitment to diverse candidates, especially women, may lead to more political struggles in the Trump era",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Democrats are harboring strong feelings of stress and gloom as the new year begins. And many are questioning whether their party's commitment to diverse candidates \u2014 especially women \u2014 may lead to further political struggles in the Donald Trump era.",
      "A recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that a significant number of Democrats believe that it may be decades before the United States will get its first female president.",
      "Specifically, about 4 in 10 Democrats said it\u2019s \u201cnot very likely\u201d or \u201cnot at all likely\u201d that a woman will be elected to the nation\u2019s highest office in their lifetime, according to a December AP-NORC poll. That\u2019s compared with about one-quarter of Republicans who feel the same.",
      "While despondency is hardly unique for a political party after a high-profile loss, that finding reflects the deep depression that has set in among Democrats about the country and their party after Trump soundly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.",
      "Such concerns may already be shaping the Democratic National Committee\u2019s search for a new leader. For the first time in more than a decade, the top candidates for the job are all white men.",
      "And looking further ahead, the party\u2019s pessimism is influencing early conversations about the contest for the 2028 presidential nomination.",
      "\u201cWe knew men hated women. The last election showed, for some of us, that we underestimated the extent to which some women hate other women,\u201d said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a Democratic state representative from South Carolina and former president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators. \u201cAmerica is as racist and misogynist as it has always been.\u201d",
      "Democrats have nominated a woman to run against Trump in two of the past three presidential elections. In both cases, Trump won decisively, over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Harris in 2024. The Democrat who unseated Trump \u2014 Joe Biden in 2020 \u2014 was a white man.",
      "Adding insult to injury for many Democrats was the long list of allegations brought by women against Trump. He was found liable in civil court for sexual abuse and convicted for a hush money case involving an adult film star. He was once caught on tape bragging that he could grab women's genitals without consent because he was a celebrity.",
      "Still, Trump narrowly carried every key swing state in November. Harris had the advantage among women, winning 53% to Trump\u2019s 46%, but that margin was somewhat narrower than Biden\u2019s. Trump's support held steady among white women, with slightly more than half supporting him, similar to 2020.",
      "Most Democrats \u2014 about 7 in 10 \u2014 believe 2025 will be a worse year for the U.S. than 2024, the AP-NORC poll found. That\u2019s compared with about 4 in 10 U.S. adults who feel that way.",
      "The poll also found that Democrats were less likely to be feeling \u201chappy\u201d or \u201chopeful\u201d about 2025 for them personally. Instead, about 4 in 10 Democrats said \u201cstressed\u201d described their feelings extremely or very well, while roughly one-third of Democrats said this about the word \u201cgloomy.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, majorities of Republicans and conservatives said \u201chappy\u201d described how they feel about 2025 at least very well. A similar share said the same about \u201chopeful.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so dark out there right now,\u201d said poll respondent Rachel Wineman, a 41-year-old Democrat from Murrieta, California. \u201cMy family and I are circling the wagons, trying to keep our heads down and survive.\u201d",
      "There are early signs that this loss has triggered questions about a core commitment of the modern-day Democratic Party to support minority groups, including women, while pushing diverse candidates into positions of power.",
      "Some Democratic leaders fear that Trump\u2019s strong success with working-class white voters \u2014 and his modest gains among Blacks and Latinos in the election \u2014 may signal a political realignment that could transform the political landscape for years to come unless the party changes its approach.",
      "The vote for a DNC chair offers the first clue as to the direction of the party during the second Trump administration. The election is three weeks away, and the leading candidates are Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin state chair, and Ken Martin, the Minnesota state party chair.",
      "Either would be the first white man in the job since Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine left the position in 2011.",
      "Martin and Wikler are considered the strong front-runners in a field of eight candidates who qualified for a DNC candidate forum Saturday, the first of four such gatherings before the Feb. 1 election at the committee's winter meeting in suburban Washington.",
      "Two candidates are women: former presidential contender Marianne Williamson and Quintessa Hathaway, a former congressional candidate, educator and civil rights activist.",
      "The outgoing chair, Jaime Harrison, who is Black, said in a statement that the committee will be well-positioned to compete in future elections and push back against Trump's policies.",
      "\u201cDemocrats stand ready to hold him accountable,\u201d Harrison said. \"We will continue to invest in all 50 states to build power from the local level on up and elect Democrats across the country.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, some rank-and-file Democrats in early primary states are openly wondering whether the party\u2019s next White House nominee would be at a disadvantage if that person is not a straight white man who is Christian. Barack Obama is the only Black man to have been elected president in American history.",
      "New Hampshire Democrat Thalia Flores said Harris\u2019 loss has made her rethink the political viability of rising stars such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the most prominent woman expected to weigh a 2028 presidential bid.",
      "\u201cKamala\u2019s loss can impact those kind of candidates, too, because anybody who\u2019s not a mainstream white guy is maybe not a good bet,\u201d Flores said, indicating that such concerns would not affect her personal vote in the next presidential primary. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we\u2019re even having the conversation.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cThe American people can\u2019t seem to support a woman.\"",
      "Overall, the AP-NORC poll found that about one-quarter of Americans said it was extremely or very likely that the country will elect a woman as president in their lifetime. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults thought it was somewhat likely and about one-third said it was not very likely or not at all likely.",
      "Such feelings are consistent among Americans regardless of age or gender, although Black Americans are more likely than white or Hispanic adults to say it\u2019s \u201cnot very likely\u201d or \u201cnot likely at all\u201d to happen in their lifetime.",
      "Sarah Burnett, a 49-year-old small business owner from Edgerton, Missouri, said she\u2019s feeling \u201cdread\u201d about the direction of the country in 2025.",
      "\u201cAll of us are not looking forward to the next four years,\u201d she said.",
      "As for whether she thinks the U.S. will elect a woman in her lifetime, she said she\u2019s trying to be optimistic.",
      "\u201cYes, there\u2019s going to be sexism involved, misogyny, the patriarchy and all of that. \u2026 But we did have a Black president,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cSo yes, I would expect a woman to be elected. Do I have high expectations? No.\"",

      "Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump, an expected move that comes amid legal wrangling over how much of that document can be made public in the days ahead.",
      "The department disclosed Smith's departure in a court filing Saturday, saying he had resigned one day earlier. The resignation, 10 days before Trump is inaugurated , follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump's White House win in November.",
      "At issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "The Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump's co-defendants in that case, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial, an argument that the Trump legal team joined in.",
      "The department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July, a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending.",
      "But prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume.",
      "In an emergency motion late Friday, they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report, but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday.",
      "The appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report, which covers Trump's efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon's injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court.",
      "The Justice Department told the appeals court in its emergency motion that Cannon's order was \u201cplainly erroneous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department,\" the Justice Department said. \"The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates.\"",
      "Justice Department regulations call for special counsels to produce reports at the conclusion of their work, and it\u2019s customary for such documents to be made public no matter the subject.",
      "William Barr, attorney general during Trump's first term, released a special counsel report examining Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.",
      "Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also released special counsel reports, including about Biden\u2019s handling of classified information before Biden became president."

      "Since the flames erupted in and around Los Angeles, scores of residents have returned to their still smoldering neighborhoods even as the threat of new fires persisted and the nation's second-largest city remained unsettled. For some, it was a first look at the staggering reality of what was lost as the region of 13 million people grapples with the gargantuan challenge of overcoming the disaster and rebuilding.",
      "Calmer winds enabled firefighters to start gaining some control of the biggest blazes in metropolitan LA on Friday before gusty weather returns over the weekend to an area that hasn\u2019t seen rain in more than eight months. But by Friday evening, new evacuations were issued in an area that includes The Getty museum as the eastern side of the Palisades Fire flared up, nearing Interstate 405.",

She also criticized the lack of water.",
      "\u201cWhen a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there\u2019s going to be water,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 11 people have been killed, with five from the Palisades Fire and six from the Eaton Fire, according to the LA County medical examiner's office. Officials said they expected that number to rise as cadaver dogs go through leveled neighborhoods to assess the devastation to an area larger than San Francisco.",

      "The disaster took homes from everyone \u2014 from waiters to movie stars. The government has not yet released figures on the cost of the damage, but private firms have estimated it will climb into the tens of billions. The Walt Disney Co. announced Friday it will donate $15 million to respond to the fires and help rebuild.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:00:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Workers making clothes for the fast fashion giant tell the BBC they labour for up to 75 hours a week.",
    "story": [
      "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.",
      "It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.",
      "This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.",
      "\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.",
      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and the UK's Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",
      "That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast.",
      "For workers in Guangzhou, this can be a challenge.",
      "\"Shein has its pros and cons,\" one factory owner told us. \"The good thing is the order is eventually big, but profit is low and it's fixed.\"",
      "Shein, given its size and influence, is a hard bargainer. So factory owners have to cut costs elsewhere, often resulting in lower staff wages.",
      "\"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\"",
      "When orders peak, however, it's a bonanza. The company ships around one million packages a day on average, according to data from ShipMatrix, a logistics consultancy firm.",
      "\"Shein is a pillar of the fashion industry,\" said Guo Qing E, a Shein supplier.",
      "\"I started when Shein started. I witnessed its rise. To be honest, Shein is an awesome company in China. I think it will become stronger, because it pays on time. This is where it is most trustworthy.",
      "\"If payment for our goods is due on the 15th, no matter whether it's millions or tens of millions, the money will be paid on time.\"",
      "Shein, with its gruelling hours and sometimes lower wages, may not be a source of comfort to all its workers. But it is a source of pride for some.",
      "\"This is the contribution we Chinese people can make to the world,\" said a 33- year-old supervisor from Guangdong, who didn't want to give her name.",
      "It's dark outside and workers are filing back into factories after their dinner for the final stretch. She admits the hours are long, but \"we get on well with each other. We are like a family\".",
      "Hours later, after many workers head home for the night, the lights in several buildings stay on.",
      "Some people work until midnight, one factory owner told us. They want to earn more money, he said.",

      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",

      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",

    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",
      "Following the interview, a Whitehall source told the BBC the government was not planning to repeal the Online Safety Act, or pass a second act, but to work within what ministers believe are its limitations.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "Reeves told reporters in Beijing she would \"take action\" to ensure she met her fiscal rules following a rise in borrowing costs.",

      "\"That includes concerns on national and economic security, market access and impacts of subsidies and industrial policy to ensure a level playing field exists.\"",
      "Tory MP and former security minister Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the timing of Reeves' visit to China was questionable.",
      "\"She's going at a time when her Budget has sacked the economy, we've got debt rates going up, and she looks like she's going with a begging bowl, not with a trading deal,\" he said. \"That's a real problem because actually it makes the UK look more vulnerable, and others around the world will see it too.\"",

      "He said: \"She's really nailed her colours to the mast there and we have seen that the markets are pretty concerned about the UK position. That is partly because we are so dependent on international flows of finance to finance our debt and trade deficit.\"",

      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",

      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",

      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 01:29:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says costs will outpace funding for schools in 2025-26.",
      "Schools say that means they will struggle to fund the government's proposed pay rise for teachers, as well as the support needed for children with special educational needs.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said it would work with schools and local authorities to provide a \"fair funding system that directs public money to where it is needed\".",
      "The IFS estimates that school funding will rise by 2.8% in the 2025-26 financial year. But Wednesday's report warns that costs are likely to rise by 3.6%, leaving schools facing tough choices.",
      "Staff pay usually takes up the majority of a school budget. The government has suggested teachers' pay should go up by 2.8% for the school year beginning September 2025, in line with plans for school spending.",
      "While spending on schools has grown in recent years - redressing previous cuts - the cost of supporting pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) has also increased.",
      "Marlborough St Mary's School in Wiltshire has had to find money from its existing budget to support pupils like six-year-old Thomas, who is waiting for an autism assessment.",
      "His mum, Penny Reader, says Year One pupil Thomas loves everything about space and creatures who live under the sea.",
      "He has one-to-one support at school, but was declined an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) - which sets out a child's legal right to support and additional funding - last year. A tribunal date to appeal that decision has been set for November.",
      "Mrs Reader says it is \"utterly insane\" that the school does not get additional funding to support Thomas, who would previously hide in the classroom getting distressed and upset.",
      "\"He just couldn't cope with the other children,\" Mrs Reader says. \"It was too noisy, too chaotic for him.\"",

      "He says he faces a choice between meeting the needs of the children, or balancing the books.",
      "Additional funding to support pupils with Send often takes a long time to materialise, he says.",
      "So, Mr Crossman employs six teaching assistants to meet the needs of children awaiting additional support, such as through an EHCP.",
      "\"It means that they are safe. It means that they are happy, and it means that they have the opportunity to learn in a mainstream school,\" he says.",

      "The school has received financial support from a private donor to set up a forest school.",

      "The IFS says per-pupil spending in mainstream schools rose by about 11% between 2019 and 2024, when adjusted for inflation.",
      "But much of that increase was absorbed by the rising cost of Send provision, meaning the actual increase was only about 5%.",

      "The \"absolutely fantastic\" parent-teacher association has also raised \u00a320,000 in the last year through sponsored challenges, film nights and discos at the school.",
      "In the past, this money would go to \"cherry-on-top\" activities like play equipment. But now, it has to fund basic curriculum resources like buying paper, Mr Hitchcock says.",
      "Staff costs take up 85% of the school's budget. Mr Hitchcock says pay rises are \"very important\" to recruit and retain staff, and to make sure it's a competitive profession.",
      "The government's recommended 2.8% pay rise for teachers next year is being considered by the independent teacher pay review body.",
      "Education unions have already described the proposal as being disappointingly low, but Mr Hitchcock says he does not know where he will find the extra money, even without any further increases.",
      "\"A nearly 3% pay rise is going to mean I have to find \u00a330,000, which just isn't possible,\" he says.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 12:11:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The government is suggesting a cap on the cost of resold tickets, potentially up to 30% on top of the original price.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced plans to cap the price of resale tickets in a clamp-down on ticket touts who bulk buy tickets and then resell them for huge profits.",
      "The cap would apply to tickets in the live events industry including sport, music, comedy and theatre.",
      "It was one of the government's election promises, after complaints from fans and concert-goers about the massively inflated cost of some resale tickets.",
      "A public consultation will now be launched to consider the cap and how much it will be - anywhere from the ticket's face value or up to 30% on top of the original price.",
      "Separately, the government is also putting out a call for evidence on dynamic pricing, which is where the price of tickets rise at times of high demand.",
      "Hundreds of people complained after experiencing dynamic pricing when Oasis tickets went on sale last August, with some fans charged more than \u00a3350 for tickets with an initial face value of \u00a3150.",
      "Oasis ditch dynamic ticket pricing for US gigs",
      "Oasis hit out at Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing after backlash",
      "According to analysis by the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), tickets sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.",
      "Investigations by Trading Standards have uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.",
      "Fans for music artists including Coldplay and Taylor Swift have complained that minutes after tickets to their concerts sold out, resale tickets were listed online for thousands of pounds.",
      "The government says its consultation will seek views on capping resale prices on a range, from the original price to up to a 30% uplift.",
      "Ministers are also proposing limiting the number of tickets that resellers can sell, to the maximum they are allowed to purchase in the original ticket sale.",
      "They also want to create new legal obligations for ticket resale websites and apps to oversee the accuracy of information they provide to fans - with Trading Standards and the Competition and Marketing Authority responsible for enforcement.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"We are taking action to strengthen consumer protections, stop fans getting ripped off and ensure money spent on tickets goes back into our incredible live events sector, instead of into the pockets of greedy touts.\"",
      "She told BBC Breakfast on Friday: \"This has been going on for years, it's been fleecing fans, and we say time is up for ticket touts, enough is enough.",
      "\"I believe that music belongs to fans, and that fans make the music industry what it is... Fans want to buy tickets but they can't, because I don't know anyone in this country that can afford \u00a31,000... for a ticket.\"",
      "She added: \"Touts are distorting the market because what they're doing is taking those tickets away from fans, inflating the prices and selling them on, so they are denying the fans the price that the ticket company has set and the band want to sell the tickets for, and instead all of that money is pouring into [the touts'] pockets.\"",
      "Alongside the consultation, ministers have launched a call for evidence into dynamic pricing - which is says is often used to sell unsold tickets with lower prices but has meant some customers have been caught out paying higher prices for high-demand events.",
      "\"The call for evidence will seek views on how the ticketing system in the live events sector is working for fans and whether the current system provides sufficient protection from unfair practices,\" the governments aid.",
      "Last year, Oasis fans were asked to pay as much as \u00a3350 per ticket, around \u00a3200 more than had been advertised, due to demand.",
      "Previously, Noel and Liam Gallagher said they had not been aware that dynamic pricing would be used for their UK stadium shows next summer - but acknowledged that the roll out of the tickets had not gone as planned.",
      "Ticketmaster has said it does not set prices and that it is down to the \"event organiser\" who \"has priced these tickets according to their market value\".",
      "'Potentially game-changing'",
      "Ticket resale sites have previously defended their services, with Viagogo saying its site ensures resales are \"a secure, safe transaction\".",
      "Viagogo's boss previously told the BBC lots of fans actually prefer buying on Viagogo instead of buying tickets direct.",
      "\"They don't want to be forced to get up on Friday morning and wait in a queue that may or may not happen,\" he says.",
      "In a statement, Viagogo said it would \"continue to constructively engage with the government\".",
      "It added that it will \"look forward to responding in full to the consultation and call for evidence on improving consumer protections in the ticketing market\".",
      "Viagogo boss defends resold Taylor Swift tickets",
      "Meanwhile, Ticketmaster said it would support a cap on the reselling of tickets.",
      "\"Since 2018, our resale has been capped at face value, providing fans a safe place to sell tickets they can't use at the original price set by artists and event organisers,\" it said.",
      "\"We support proposals to introduce an industry-wide resale price cap. We also urge the government to crack down on bots and ban speculative ticket sales.\"",
      "Sarah Cardell, CEO of CMA, added: \"We know from our own work on ticket reselling that fans often have to jump through hoops and can be left out of pocket or turned away at the door.",
      "\"That is why we made recommendations to the previous government to tackle illegal bulk-buying, stop speculative selling and hold platforms accountable for inaccurate ticket information.\"",
      "She said they \"welcome this fresh opportunity to bring in the stronger protections consumers need in this area\".",
      "Fan-to-fan resale site Twickets' founder Richard Davies gave his support to a cap on ticket resale prices, and called on the government to \"investigate a potential cap on booking fees to ensure they remain proportionate and reasonable\".",
      "'Inflated prices'",
      "Campaigners and music artists have welcomed the consultation. UK Music, which represents the UK's music industry, said it wanted a \"clear price cap\".",
      "Musician and DJ Fatboy Slim gave his backing to the government's proposals, saying it was \"great to see money being put back into fans' pockets instead of resellers\".",
      "Labour's Sharon Hodgson, the MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse and has been campaigning for 15 years on the issue, also welcomed the government's proposal.",
      "\"I hope all those who have been affected by the inflated prices, speculative ticket selling or fallen victim to scams that are prolific within the secondary market will get involved in this consultation,\" she said.",
      "FanFair Alliance, a campaign group that was set up against ticket touts, called the measures \"potentially game-changing\".",
      "It pointed to other countries - such as Ireland which banned ticket touting in 2021 - saying it shows \"how legislation to prevent the resale of tickets for profit can massively curb the illegal and anti-consumer practices of online ticket touts and offshore resale platforms. The UK simply needs to follow their example\"."

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:59:47 GMT",
    "summary": "As Love Island All Stars returns, we find out if reality stars can still have a lucrative social media career.",
    "story": [
      "The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers.",
      "More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on.",
      "Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.",
      "But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end?",
      "Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users.",
      "Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company.",
      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",
      "\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.",
      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",
      "'Just being good looking is not going to get you much'",
      "Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.",
      "\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.",
      "\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.",
      "Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".",
      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",
      "\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds.",
      "'People would do adverts for every single company'",
      "Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures.",
      "At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million.",
      "With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal.",
      "Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media.",
      "He manages boxer Tommy Fury and sports presenter Mac Griffiths (known as Michael on Love Island), who both appeared on the aforementioned 2019 series of the show.",
      "\"People would come off a show and do adverts for every single company, because these companies would want to take advantage of the quick exposure they could get,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But four or five months down the line you'd be harming your own career, because you'd used your platform the wrong way and there'd be no credibility there,\" he adds.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 02:04:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Ezra Collective cap an extraordinary year by being named runners-up in BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025.",
    "story": [
      "If you think Ezra Collective's music is life-affirming, just wait until you meet them in person.",
      "Tumbling into the BBC's Maida Vale studios, the band are boisterous and charming, the sort of people to greet a perfect stranger like a long-lost cousin.",
      "Bandleader and drummer Femi Koleoso has a room-filling smile and a zest for life that infuses his music.",
      "\"We're just trying to bring something positive and joyful to whoever will listen,\" he says. \"So anything that exposes us to more people is always gratefully received.\"",
      "Today, that means the honour of being named runner-up in the BBC's Sound Of 2025.",
      "The annual poll, which has been running since 2003, has tipped everyone from 50 Cent and Adele, to Raye and Dua Lipa for success.",
      "Ezra Collective's addition to the list comes relatively late in their career. They've already won the Mercury Prize, for their second album Where I'm Meant To Be, and last November, they became the first jazz act to sell out Wembley Arena.",
      "But to their minds, the band are still newcomers.",
      "Koleoso recalls the thrumming intensity of making his Wembley debut.",
      "\"Fifteen minutes before the gig, I made the horrific mistake of reading the wall backstage,\" he says.",
      "\"They'd put up the names of everyone who'd played there before us. So it was like, 'OK, Beyonc\u00e9 played here, and Jay-Z and Stormzy and Madonna\u2026 And now it's Ezra Collective's turn'.\"",
      "If they were intimidated, it didn't show. The quintet turn audience participation into an artform, venturing out into the crowd and making fans part of their ensemble, almost like a New Orleans parade.",
      "Reviews were ecstatic, calling the show a \"masterclass in musicianship\" that left \"every single person with a smile on their face.\"",
      "As a result, Ezra Collective's name will be added to the Wembley Wall \u2013 but Koleoso wants it to have a radically different effect.",
      "\"Wouldn't it be great if, in 10 years' time, some band is getting intimidated by Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna, and then they see our name, and they're like, 'Oh yeah, they came into our school to do an assembly - so we'll be fine'?\".",
      "Community and musical kinship is Ezra Collective's foundation stone; one that can be traced back to the youth club Tomorrow's Warriors, where they first met in central London in 2012.",
      "The charity offers training to musicians who can't afford private tuition, with a special focus on \"those with a background from the African Diaspora and girls, who are often under-represented in the music industry\".",
      "\"It's where I met my best friends,\" says Koleoso, who remains a passionate supporter of youth clubs.",
      "\"Not to get too deep, but how do you fix domestic violence or the male suicide rate? You teach a 14-year-old boy how to deal with rejection, how to love people, how to control anger, how to respect others.",
      "\"Youth clubs can help with that. By the time someone's 24, it's almost too late.\"",

      "4) Myles Smith",
      "3) Barry Can't Swim",
      "2) Ezra Collective",
      "1) Chappell Roan",
      "When Koleoso first visited Tomorrow's Warriors with his brother TJ, they'd already formed a tight rhythm section in their church band. In fact, Femi had been playing drums since he was four.",
      "\"Maybe I'm slightly biased, but I think the drums are the best instrument, because you can see what's going on,\" he says.",
      "\"When I watch our horn section, I'm hearing thousands of notes, but I'm only seeing three valves. It doesn't quite make sense. But with the drums, you hit them and they make a sound.",
      "\"I wish everything was as simple as that.\"",
      "Tomorrow's Warriors introduced Koleoso to jazz, a genre he'd previously considered elite and inaccessible, and to his future bandmates James Mollison (sax), Ife Ogunjobi (trumpet) and Joe Armon-Jones (keyboards).",
      "Together, they ripped the genre rulebook to shreds, magpie-ing elements of Afrobeat, hip-hop, grime, reggae, Latin, R&B, highlife and jazz to create a sound that bulges with possibility.",
      "\"We're the shuffle generation,\" explains Koleoso. \"We listen to Beethoven and 50 Cent comes on straight after. That influences the way we approach music: We love jazz but at the same time I love salsa too, so why not try and get that in there?\"",
      "After playing their first gig in a Foyles bookshop, they released their debut EP, Chapter 7, in 2016, and a debut album, You Can't Steal My Joy in 2019.",
      "Then Covid hit.",
      "\"We were meant to do a world tour but shortly after we arrived in New Zealand, we were told get back to London because the world was collapsing,\" says Koleoso.",
      "Lockdown inspired their second album, but instead of introspection and gloom, it's an immensely energetic record, fuelled by the promise of post-pandemic reconnection.",
      "\"What we found was we had each other,\" says Koleoso. \"It felt like we were meant to be together, and we made as many tracks as we could that articulate that.\"",
      "When it won the Mercury Prize, the follow-up was already in the bag.",
      "Dance, No-One's Watching was recorded over three days (\"one was just setting up\") at Abbey Road Studios, with the band still slightly worse-for-wear after a weekend at the Notting Hill Carnival.",
      "The idea was to capture the excitement of their live show direct to tape \u2013 with an audience of family and friends to stop them obsessing over the technicalities of recording.",
      "\"What you're hearing is very, very real. We just played it and then had a listen back, and were like, 'Yeah, put it on a vinyl'.\"",
      "That's why the album features a short, aborted performance of Ajala, with Koleoso ordering his bandmates to play harder on the next take.",
      "\"A lot of people think that's a skit, but it was a very real moment,\" he says. \"I wanted the song to go off, but it didn't, so we stopped and tried again.",
      "\"Those things are precious, because they will never happen again.",
      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, the album is immersed in the real world. Themed around a night out in London, it celebrates the sacred power of dancing and losing yourself in music with other people.",
      "There's even a song titled N29, after the night bus Koleso used to catch home from nights out in London.",
      "Anyone who's braved one of those 3am rides home will recognise the song's mixture of post-club euphoria, random conversations and the backdrop of potential violence.",
      "Koleoso says his first experience of that liminal reality came after his high school prom.",
      "\"Our school got one of those fancy little boats on the Thames and everyone paid their \u00a320, which, for a state school in Enfield, was an impressive night out,\" he recalls.",
      "\"This was at the height of grime and funky house, so I'm just having the best time in my life, dancing on this boat in a suit\u2026 then I missed the last tube home.\"",
      "In a time before Google Maps, it took a while to locate the right bus. When he finally clambered on board, it was carnage.",
      "\"I grew 10 years in that one journey, do you know what I mean?\" he laughs. \"I saw waaaay to much life!\"",
      "His desire to document life in all its messy, wonderful glory is the album's core.",
      "\"In 2022, we got to travel the whole world. We had amazing nights in New Orleans, on colourful streets with so much going on that it's hard to describe.",
      "\"And you'd think, 'How do I get this feeling into a song? I want someone in their flat in Edmonton to get a glimpse of this.'",
      "\"Or you'd go to the shrine in Lagos and be like, 'I need to convey the feeling of the shrine to someone who lives in Cardiff.'\"",
      "Ezra Collective's ever-growing audience suggests they've successfully completed that mission.",
      "But there's one person who'll be surprised: Koleoso's A-level music teacher.",
      "\"Here's the secret, I got a D in music,\" he confesses.",
      "\"I was pretty embarrassed, because it made difficult to convince my parents that playing music was gonna be OK.",
      "\"But what it tells you is that exams can determine one type of intelligence, but they're not the be-all and end-all.",
      "\"If there was an exam in shutting down shows, I think I'd do better than a D.\"",
      "Amen to that.",

    "summary": "The Luton-born singer-songwriter has taken fourth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Rising pop star Myles Smith can still remember the first time he felt famous.",
      "\"This might sound trivial,\" says the singer, \"but I was playing a concert where I asked the audience, 'Does anyone have cookies?'",
      "\"And within about 10 minutes, the whole dressing room was full of cookies.",
      "\"It was the best thing ever.\"",
      "Since that gig, the 26-year-old's career has only grown bigger.",
      "Last year, he scored his first major hit with Stargazing, a feel-good foot-stomper that became the biggest-selling British single of 2024, and even featured on Barack Obama's end of year playlist.",
      "Now, he's been voted into fourth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025, marking him out as one of the year's most promising new talents.",
      "And in March, he'll receive the Brit Awards' Rising Star prize \u2013 following in the footsteps of Sam Fender, Adele and Rag 'N' Bone Man.",
      "Smith confesses he learned about the accolade while in the grip of a ferocious hangover.",
      "\"The night before, I'd tried to go drink-for-drink with some people who were a lot more experienced than me, and we actually had to call a doctor to my Airbnb,\" he cringes.",
      "\"Finding out I'd got a Brit Award brought me back to life more than any vitamin C ever could.\"",
      "It was, he says \"the most LA I've ever felt\".",
      "It's certainly a long way from his upbringing in Luton.",
      "Born to a working class British-Jamaican family, he was a bright and happy kid, who grew up singing along to his mum's Motown records.",
      "His first true musical discovery was Coldplay's Yellow (\"it resonated with me, even though I didn't understand a word of it\") but Luton's social and cultural diversity meant he was exposed to hundreds of different genres.",
      "\"I went through a lot of stages,\" he says. \"I was a huge Green Day fan at one point. I even went through a bit of a Screamo phase.\"",
      "Before long, he was writing his own songs \u2013 initially by dreaming up melodies and lyrics to instrumentals he'd found on YouTube, then creating originals on a guitar he'd been given for his ninth birthday.",
      "\"I remember writing this song called Dream Girl, when I was 11,\" he says.",
      "\"It was about a girl at school, and it was bloody awful - but I sang it at school assembly anyway.",
      "\"Terrible decision. She realised it was about her and avoided me every day after that.\"",
      "Undeterred, he started playing at open mic nights around the town \u2013 covering artists like Ed Sheeran and Marcus Mumford while fine-tuning his distinctive folk-pop style.",
      "For a long time, however, music was a side hustle. After completing a sociology degree in 2019, Smith set up his own business, specialising in management and strategic development, and was turning a healthy profit by the time he was 23.",
      "\"I was quite comfortable,\" he says. \"But I understood quite early on that just because I'm good at something, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm passionate about it.\"",
      "He ploughed his earnings into studio sessions, recording an eight-track album called Scars in 2020. But it wasn't until his haunting cover of The Neighbourhood's Sweater Weather went viral in 2022 that he felt confident enough to pack in his day job.",
      "\"Money has never been the way I measure my success, but it was definitely scary,\" he says.",
      "\"It started off very much like plunging into an ice bath and feeling the shock. Like, 'OK, this is real. I don't have a consistent salary coming in, and I don't have the security of knowing how long this is going to take.'",
      "\"But it was a matter of switching mentality - so I wasn't looking at what securities I had lost, but what opportunities I'd gained.\"",
      "Any apprehension was short-lived.",

      "1) Chappell Roan",
      "With a growing online fanbase, Smith started interspersing TikTok cover versions with snippets of originals.",
      "The one that made everyone pay attention was Solo \u2013 whose devious wordplay was so obviously memorable (\"Why'd you get me so high/ To leave me solo\") you couldn't quite believe no-one had thought of it before.",
      "Released independently in 2023, it earned Smith his first UK chart hit and, subsequently, a deal with RCA Records.",
      "But he continued to build his audience organically, gigging constantly while posting on TikTok and YouTube.",
      "He's got an interesting take on social media. While artists like Halsey and Florence Welch have expressed frustration at record label pressure to create viral videos,  Smith calls TikTok a \"meritocratic system\" that rewards the effort you put in.",
      "\"There's a difference between the chase for virality and building an audience,\" he reasons.",
      "\"If your objective is to go viral, then you're always going to be fighting a losing battle. But if your objective is to establish a community and a place where your music belongs, it becomes a lot more rewarding.\"",
      "When he's not sharing music, there's a thoughtful tone to his social posts. In one recent note, he addressed people who said his music had \"saved their lives\".",
      "\"I need you to know, it wasn't my music, it was you,\" he wrote. \"I know this because I've been where you are. I've clung to songs in the dark searching for something \u2013 anything \u2013 that made me feel like I could keep going.",
      "\"But music didn't save me. What saved me was the smallest part of me that chose to stay, even when it hurt.",
      "\"My songs might walk beside you, but it's your strength that carries you forward.\"",
      "That empathy is baked into Smith's lyrics. His most affecting songs, such as River and Wait For You, are covenants of support for a friend who's drowning in their troubles.",
      "His breakout hit, Stargazing, is also about a moment of human connection \u2013 looking into the cosmos and realising \"the person we fall in love with has been there our whole life\".",
      "He's previously claimed the track was inspired by a sunset in Malibu, but it turns out that that's a little white lie.",
      "Smith actually came up with the folky, clap-along chorus and its central lyric (\"You and I stargazing/ Intertwining souls\") while eating tacos and salsa with his co-writers, Peter Fenn and Jesse Fink, early last year.",
      "They were so inspired that they demo'd the song in just 15 minutes \u2013 just as the sun was setting over Malibu.",
      "\"Somehow, that moment gave the lyric a meaning,\" says the singer. \"It was an afterthought, but it was a very beneficial afterthought.\"",
      "He started posting snippets of the song online almost immediately, and \"from the very first post, the reaction was explosive\".",
      "There was only one problem: they hadn't finished the verses.",
      "For a month, they frantically traded voice notes and Zoom calls, pulling the song into focus in time for a May release. Since then, it's been streamed more than 600 million times.",
      "\"It's quite wild,\" says the singer. \"It's still getting played, seven or eight months down the line, which is awesome.\"",
      "Smith ended 2024 with a clutch of honours \u2013 from his first Brit Award, to being named BBC Introducing's Artist Of The Year \u2013 and the release of his new EP, \u2026A Minute.",
      "At the start of 2025, he's juggling writing sessions for his debut album with a hectic touring schedule that sees him playing 36 shows in 60 days in 16 countries. But if that sounds daunting, he's prepared.",
      "\"It's a lot, for sure, but I used to stand on the edge of my sofa and pretend I was at Glastonbury. So being able to tour, at whatever scale, is just such a privilege that it doesn't feel like hard work.\"",
      "What's more, he's guaranteed to get free cookies.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:16:24 GMT",
    "summary": "We meet some of the first NHS patients, as expert says funding everyone eligible would \"bankrupt\" the service.",
    "story": [
      "Ray, 62 from south London, became one of the first patients to receive the weight-loss jab Wegovy on the NHS last year and has lost 14kg (just over two stone) in five months.",
      "BBC Panorama joined him as he was prescribed his first dose at London's Guy's Hospital, where he was told he would probably need to take the drug all his life to prevent him regaining weight. He said he felt \"blessed\" to be given the drug.",
      "But the NHS spending watchdog NICE has ruled that each patient can only receive Wegovy for two years. And only a tiny proportion of the eligible 3.4 million patients in England are getting access to the drugs.",
      "Prof Naveed Sattar, who leads the UK government's Obesity Healthcare Goals programme, says if everyone eligible was given the drug right away \"it would simply bankrupt the NHS\".",
      "Being overweight is now the norm and nearly one in three adults in England is obese - double the rate of just 30 years ago.",
      "Obesity can be very bad for your health, and treating the complications from it is estimated to cost the NHS across the UK more than \u00a311bn a year.",
      "Wegovy and another drug called Mounjaro can help patients lose about 15 to 20% of their bodyweight, according to trials.",
      "That sort of weight loss can have a dramatic impact on health, and greatly reduce a patient's risk of many conditions, from diabetes to cancer, joint problems and heart disease.",
      "BBC Panorama has been given exclusive access to the weight management service at London's Guy's Hospital, which has begun rolling out Wegovy to a small group of patients who meet the criteria - a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 and at least one weight-related health complication.",
      "They include care home worker Ray, who weighed 148kg or 23 stone when he began taking Wegovy in July 2024. He has struggled with his weight all his life.",
      "Ray needs two operations, but doctors have said he needs to lose weight first.",
      "With so many patients meeting the criteria, the hospital is prioritising those like Ray who need surgery or who have multiple weight-related health complications.",
      "Here, not only is Ray given the drug, which is taken via weekly injection under the skin, but he gets face-to-face support from doctors and dietitians - advice not always given to those buying the drug privately online.",
      "They stress the jabs do not do all the work and it is important that patients change their lifestyle, and eat healthier food and smaller portions.",
      "Ray is joined at the appointment by one of his daughters, Sophie, who says it would be \"amazing\" if he could reach his goal of losing three stone: \"I wouldn't recognise him. It would be like I have a brand new dad.\"",
      "For now, the drug is available on the NHS in England via these specialist services, mostly in hospitals.",
      "But the chances of getting the drug are low.",
      "Out of more than 130,000 patients eligible for weight-loss drugs in south-east London, the Guy's clinic reckons it can only see about 3,000.",
      "The weight-loss jab that most people know is Ozempic. It has been in huge demand and popularised by celebrities, from Elon Musk to Sharon Osbourne. In fact, it is meant to be for type 2 diabetes.",
      "Wegovy contains the same ingredient, semaglutide, but in different dosages.",
      "Semaglutide mimics a gut hormone that sends signals to our brain telling us we are full. It also slows the transit of food through the stomach.",
      "In trials, patients on Wegovy lost an average of 15% body weight, when combined with lifestyle and dietary advice.",
      "Experts warn the drugs should only be taken under proper medical supervision, because like all medicines they come with side effects, which not all patients can cope with.",
      "These are mostly gastro-intestinal - such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation - but there are potentially serious complications including inflammation of the pancreas.",
      "To help them cope with the side effects, patients are started on a low dose of the weight-loss jabs, and it is gradually increased, month by month.",
      "Ray is doing well on the drug, eating smaller portions, and after five months there is a visible difference.",
      "At his appointment at Guy's just before Christmas, he weighs 134kg, a weight loss of 14kg or just over two stone.",
      "He is delighted. \"I can't believe the amount of weight I've lost. Every time my daughters see me they say I'm shrinking. It's been a really good journey.\"",
      "Ray says he feels \"lucky\" to have had access to the drug via the NHS, especially now he is a granddad to Willow.",
      "Ray says despite putting many new holes in his belt, his trousers are so loose they are falling off him.",
      "Prof Barbara McGowan, an expert in obesity and diabetes, who runs the weight management service at Guy's is delighted with the progress of patients such as Ray.",
      "She says most clinicians hope that NICE's two-year limit will be removed \"because obesity is a chronic disease and we need to manage it long-term\".",
      "That may not be such an issue now that a second, even more effective drug has been approved by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).",
      "Mounjaro has been dubbed the \"King Kong\" of weight-loss jabs as in a key trial, patients lost an average of 21% of bodyweight over eight months.",
      "Unlike Wegovy, no restriction has been put on how long NHS patients can stay on the drug.",
      "But the NHS is going to roll out the drug over 12 years because of concerns it could overwhelm services.",
      "Over the next three years it is estimated just 220,000 people in England will benefit, out of 3.4 million who are eligible.",
      "Prof Sattar, from Glasgow University, says it is a simple matter of economics: \"The cost of the drugs is still at a level where we cannot afford to treat several million people within the UK with these drugs. It would simply bankrupt the NHS.\"",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?The Briefing Room: Will new weight loss drugs save or bankrupt the NHS?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The Briefing Room: Will new weight loss drugs save or bankrupt the NHS?",
      "He estimates it costs the NHS about \u00a33,000 a year to give a patient either Mounjaro or Wegovy.",
      "So if everyone eligible in England received them right now, that would be about \u00a310bn annually - half the entire NHS drugs budget.",
      "Jean, who is 62, hopes Mounjaro will help her to get her weight and health back on track. She shows me a picture of herself on her phone from a decade before, when she was visibly far lighter and healthier.",
      "\"I was a fitness fanatic. I went to the gym practically every day. I don't know what happened, why I fell off the wagon.\"",
      "She believes her relationship with food is \"terrible\". \"I have a lot of food noise and I tend to act on it,\" she says, using a term coined to describe cravings and preoccupation with food.",
      "Jean is eligible for Mounjaro because she has type 2 diabetes and has been injecting insulin for five years.",
      "She is worried about side effects, which are similar to those for Wegovy, but will be carefully monitored at a diabetes clinic in south London linked to Guy's.",
      "Mounjaro helps stabilise blood-sugar levels and boost the body's natural production of insulin.",
      "After just five weeks on the drug, Jean is able to stop her insulin. She is delighted: \"I think it's Mounjaro, and willpower as well - I have to give myself some credit.\u202f I think the drug silences the food noise and I'm not constantly sitting around thinking about what I'm going to eat.\"",
      "After two months on the drug, Jean is back in the gym, and has lost more than 3kg (half a stone).",
      "She is disappointed in her weight loss, but determined to shed more pounds as her Mounjaro dose is increased.",
      "But Jean and the other patients getting Wegovy and Mounjaro on the NHS are the minority.",
      "Prof Sattar reckons more than nine in 10 patients currently on weight-loss drugs in the UK are paying for them privately.",
      "He points out that obesity rates are highest in areas of social deprivation.",
      "\"The people perhaps who stand to benefit the most, who are less affluent and from more deprived communities, are simply not able to afford this drug. It's not fair. It's just a reality of the economics of the situation.\"",
      "But Prof Sattar told me that rising obesity levels could also eventually \"bankrupt\" the NHS.",
      "With smoking levels continuing to fall, he now regards excess weight and obesity as the \"major driver, bar none, of long-term multiple health conditions\".",
      "Both he and Prof McGowan believe that weight-loss jabs have an important role to play and could eventually bring some wider savings.",
      "Prof McGowan says Ray is a good example: \"We treat a lot of the complications associated with obesity. Ray has pre-diabetes. We're hoping to go into remission and therefore prevent all the complications associated with that progressive disease.",
      "\"He might need joint surgery but achieving weight loss can prevent a lot of complications and ultimately save the NHS a lot of money.\"",
      "Prof Sattar says in 10 years there could be 20 weight-loss drugs on the market, including some in tablet form. As more effective and cheaper drugs become available, they could produce savings for the NHS, he says.",
      "The UK government also thinks weight-loss drugs could eventually bring wider economic benefits.",
      "A five-year trial in Manchester will look at the wider impact of Mounjaro beyond the individual health benefits, including whether it helps some people struggling with obesity to get back into work.",
      "The drugs are not a magic bullet for obesity, but after decades of expanding waistlines, they offer hope to millions.",
      "For now, though, the health service doesn't have the resources to treat all those eligible. It means - for years to come - only a minority like Ray will get access on the NHS. The rest will have to pay - or go without.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "NHS needs better plan around weight loss jabs, warn experts",

      "Calcium is an important mineral for strengthening bones and keeping your teeth healthy, but there is growing evidence it also protects against some cancers.",

      "Why are HMPV cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring.",
      "This is because viruses survive better in the cold, and can pass more easily from one person to another as people spend more time indoors with closed windows.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",

      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",
      "GPs, youth workers and social workers I have spoken to shared similar stories, with many pointing out that mental health cases in the young are rising in ever greater numbers.",
      "One in five children and young people between the ages of eight and 25 in England are now thought to have a mental health disorder, according to official figures. Unsurprisingly, the NHS is struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "But it is not just a crisis that is placing demands on the health service. It's also depriving the economy of workers with rising numbers of young people being left unable to work.",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",

      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is \"no real movement\" within government on online safety.",
    "story": [
      "The father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after seeing harmful content online, has personally appealed to the prime minister to tighten rules that protect children and has warned the UK is \"going backwards\" on internet safety.",
      "Ian Russell, who backed the previous government bringing in new requirements for tech firms in the Online Safety Act, calls the way the regulator Ofcom is implementing the rules a \"disaster\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday, seen by the BBC, Mr Russell says there is \"widespread dismay\" among bereaved families who have fought for tougher protections, and that more young people have lost their lives because of \"dither and delay\".",
      "And he warns that without tougher actions, \"the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model\".",
      "\"This preventable harm would be happening on your watch,\" he writes to Sir Keir.",
      "The Online Safety Act, introduced last year, is designed to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms and protect children from some legal-but-harmful material. Ofcom decides the specific guidelines that companies must follow.",
      "Safety campaigners believe there are significant loopholes in Ofcom's code on illegal content, including a lack of specific rules on live streaming or content that promotes suicide and self-harm. And the new codes of practice, which are still being worked on, won't apply to private messaging.",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We recognise the profound pain caused by harmful content online, and our deepest sympathies remain with Ian Russell and all those who have suffered unimaginable loss.\" They said the voices of victims \"will continue to be at the heart of our work\".",
      "The spokesperson added that tech firms are required to assess the risks of illegal harms on their platforms by 16 March, and after that companies would need measures to reduce the risk of illegal content appearing and to remove it quickly when it appears.",
      "\"In the coming months, as our enforcement powers commence, platforms will face further obligations to protect children from harmful content, even where it is not illegal,\" they said.",
      "What is the Online Safety Act and how can you keep children safe online?",
      "What is the Online Safety Act and how can you keep children safe online?",
      "In his letter, Mr Russell also says Elon Musk, who is the boss of X, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg are part of a \"wholesale recalibration\" of the online world, moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\".",
      "\"In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most,\" he writes.",
      "And in an exclusive interview, Mr Russell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, were turning \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to and therefore more children will be exposed to in the future\".",
      "\"And by turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money,\" he said. Zuckerberg announced this week that Meta was abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told the BBC that there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and that the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "\"We want young people to have safe and age-appropriate experiences on our apps - this has not changed,\" they said.",
      "Mr Russell called on the government to both bolster the Online Safety Act and to introduce extra legislation designed to tackle what he describes as \"the reckless behaviours of social media leadership\".",
      "He also said that he thought there was \"no real movement\" within government. \"The online safety push has stagnated,\" he said. \"In fact, we're probably heading backwards because the tech platforms have changed the way they're playing the game.\"",
      "He said he was sure Sir Keir \"is a father who protects his children from online dangers as much as any individual can\".",
      "\"But as a prime minister, he needs to really back online safety and move forward so that the UK is the safest place in the world to be online,\" he added.",
      "A No 10 spokesperson said Sir Keir was thankful for Mr Russell's letter: \"Ian Russell, alongside many other families and parents, has shown immense bravery through the most tragic of circumstances to campaign for children's online safety. We are grateful for all their contributions and will continue to work with them to get this right.",
      "\"This government is committed to ensuring online safety for children. Social media platforms must step up to their responsibilities and take robust action to protect children from seeing harmful content on their sites.\"",
      "Mr Russell's daughter Molly took her own life in November 2017 after being exposed to a stream of dark, depressing content on Pinterest and Instagram. He has been campaigning for online safety measures since his daughter's death.",
      "You can read his letter in full at the bottom of this story.",
      "Ian Russell's voice hard for Starmer to ignore",
      "No one watching or listening to Mr Russell over the years could deny his passion for change or his deep knowledge of the dark world that Molly was caught up in. Along with other bereaved parents we have met in the past couple of years - including Esther Ghey, Judy Thomas, and Mariano Janin - he has told his family's story with huge dignity, and for a simple reason: he doesn't want anyone else to go through the pain.",
      "He's become a prominent campaigner on an issue that is important to millions of parents and young people around the country. His voice is hard for the government to ignore.",
      "But creating and then imposing rules on the online world is difficult for politicians for many reasons.",
      "The Online Safety Act weathered many controversies and took years to put together. On one side were campaigners concerned about providing protection, on the other, fierce lobbying from the tech companies against straying into censorship or invading people's privacy.",
      "Ofcom was picked to police the rules and could theoretically be incredibly tough, threatening fines of millions of pounds or even prison for those companies that break them. But the new codes of practice are not yet fully in force.",
      "But campaigners like Mr Russell believe it's already obvious the rules fall short. The Internet Watch Foundation boss, Derek Ray-Hill, also told us: \"Unless Ofcom is more ambitious in its interpretation of the Act, so many of the things the legislation makes possible will remain frustratingly out of reach.\"",
      "There is a sense in Whitehall of \"wait and see\". Ministers have acknowledged that as technology advances, extra laws might be required. The Home Office is expected in the next couple of weeks to outline new offences to tackle child abuse online. But the government is also nervous about making rules so tight that tech companies feel unwelcome.",
      "This weekend we'll be joined by the Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, who is determined to make the UK a good place for big tech companies to do business, to help the economy grow. From Sunday onwards he will spell out how artificial intelligence can speed up government business and improve our public services \u2013 this government, like Rishi Sunak's, believes AI can boost the UK's sagging productivity.",
      "But the advance of those technologies bring risks, and tricky decisions for ministers.",
      "Warnings that advanced AI could wipe out thousands of jobs; concerns over deepfake video in pornography, child abuse, or misinformation. Even Paul McCartney and Kate Bush have got the government in their sights as they campaign to try to protect artists' work being used without payment by giant AI platforms, upending decades of copyright law.",
      "Multiple sources familiar with government discussions on child safety and other aspects of this massive quandary say they are concerned the Department of Science and Technology (DSIT) is not paying enough attention to the possible downsides.",
      "A government source said some discussions about protecting people online had been \"spicy\". \"This is a form of harm. It's normal for departments like Home Office and Department of Health to be constantly reviewing what's going on to keep up with safety \u2013 [DSIT] is not yet used to having to doing the same.\"",
      "A source at DSIT said the department had already acknowledged there might have to be more legislation in future but highlighted the fact that the Ofcom codes aren't yet completed or in force.",
      "And a spokesperson said: \"Bereaved parents have suffered the most unimaginable loss, and we are prepared to use every lever at our disposal to improve online safety for children.",
      "\"Changes coming into force through the Online Safety Act will ensure platforms have to act to protect children from harmful online content, with Ofcom ready to enforce these new laws from March. They have our complete backing to use the full range of their powers to root harmful material from the internet, and we expect platforms to be acting now to prepare for these changes.\"",
      "These aren't new arguments. But Musk's trolling of the UK government and Zuckerberg's flex away from fact checking have shifted the ground on which the conversations are taking place.",
      "Ministers have to consider what's right for the economy as well as protecting the public. And they might not want to admit it, but no politician wants to pick a fight with billionaires with massive social media megaphones - or indeed be seen to curtail our liberties or privacy without good reason. Arguably that is why measures like the Online Safety Act took so long to introduce in the first place.",
      "The palpable fear from campaigners like Mr Russell is that just as technology has been speeding up, hard-fought moves to put safety first have been slowing down.",

      "The letter in full",
      "Dear Prime Minister,",
      "Six months ago, you were elected on a platform that promised an end to short-term sticking plaster solutions. I am writing to you as a bereaved father and online safety campaigner because it is evident that urgent action is required to protect young people from the horrors they are routinely exposed to online.",
      "It's now over seven years since the death of my youngest daughter Molly. More than ever before, I am convinced that strong and effective online safety regulation is the most powerful tool available to prevent the loss of ever more young lives at the hands of social media platforms whose indifference to children's safety is fundamentally baked into their commercial strategies, business models and products.",
      "However, in recent months it has become clear that progress towards online safety has stalled \u2013 and we are now going backwards. Regulation as it is currently designed is failing to deliver the protection that children and parents need, want and deserve. No one can credibly claim that Ofcom's implementation of the Online Safety Act is anything other than a disaster \u2013 a view not only shared widely by civil society but also increasingly privately shared across many parts of your Government.",
      "Ofcom's choices when implementing the Act have starkly highlighted intrinsic structural weaknesses with the legislative framework. We not only have a regulator which has fundamentally failed to grasp the urgency and scale of its mission, but a regulatory model that inherently and significantly constrains its ability to reduce preventable harms.",
      "While I understand that this is legislation you inherited and did not design, the reality is that unless you now commit to act decisively to fix the Online Safety Act, the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model. This preventable harm would be happening on your watch.",
      "At the same time as the UK's overdue regulation is falling badly short, the very industry being regulated is ominously changing. The Online Safety Act was developed around a premise that large tech firms would increasingly accept their responsibilities, and we would see safer social networks develop over time.",
      "However, this is a time when platforms readily say they will now 'catch less of the bad stuff'; allow underdeveloped AI to generate and spread disinformation; and promote targeted and polarising content leading to isolation and despair. We have now entered a different era, and we will need a different regulatory approach that can address it.",
      "Put simply, people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry. We should be in absolutely no doubt that when Zuckerberg speaks about a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech', he is signalling a profound strategic shift away from fundamental safety measures towards a laissez-faire, anything goes model. In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most.",
      "It's on that basis that I now encourage you to act swiftly and decisively to address this coming flood of preventable harm. In the immediate term, that means strengthening the existing framework. Beyond that, it means committing to substantially strengthened regulatory model \u2013 with primary legislation being introduced as soon as possible to enact its provisions.",
      "It is not just a new Online Safety Act that is required, but a wholesale re-imagining of the framework to ensure it is capable of responding to the threats of today and beyond. A new framework must be fundamentally oriented towards tackling the reckless behaviours of social media leadership \u2013 a goal which can best be achieved through establishing an overarching Duty of Care supported by a robust set of conduct-based rules to enforce it.",
      "A bolstered OSA must have harm reduction at its core. That means having a clear harm reduction duty on Ofcom, transparency and safety-by-design as integral components of the regulatory regime, and a regulatory design that puts victims at its core \u2013 a major failure of the current regime, where the asymmetry between the interests of victims and industry has if anything been substantially reinforced. The voices of those with lived experience must be heard clearly if big tech's powerful players are not to shout them down in this debate.",
      "Crucially, this must also mean an extension of the Duty of Candour to extend to tech firms. This vital measure stands to correct the historic injustices faced by so many victims, and the power of this measure to address the cultural issues driving harms in the tech sector \u2013 and the asymmetry between industry and victims which perpetuates further harm \u2013 would be considerable.",
      "Too many parents have lost hope that governments will deliver the online safety reform they urgently need. Among bereaved families, there is widespread dismay that successive governments have chosen to dither and delay when the consequences of inaction has been further lost lives.",
      "As Prime Minister and as a father, I implore you to act. You now have a profound opportunity, but also a great responsibility, to act clearly and decisively and to show to millions of parents across this country that meaningful change is on the way. It is time to decisively protect children and young adults from the perils of our online world.",

    "story": [
      "A cabinet minister has rejected a call from Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs, while leaving the door open for a future investigation.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she disagreed with Burnham's support for a fresh inquiry into historical child sexual abuse in areas including Oldham and Rochdale, in Greater Manchester.",
      "The Conservatives and Reform UK have both backed calls from tech billionaire Elon Musk for a new national investigation.",
      "But Labour ministers have said their priority is to implement the 2022 recommendations of a seven-year inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay into child sexual abuse.",
      "Burnham backs 'limited' national abuse inquiry",
      "MPs vote against Tory call for new grooming gangs inquiry",
      "Musk's 'disinformation' endangering me, says Phillips",
      "On Wednesday, MPs voted against a Tory move to force a fresh national investigation.",
      "Burnham told BBC Radio Manchester he thought there was a case for a \"limited national inquiry that draws on reviews like the one that I commissioned, and the one we have seen in Rotherham, the one we have seen in Telford, to draw out some of these national issues and compel people to give evidence, who then may have charges to answer and be held to account\".",
      "Asked about this on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Nandy, MP for Wigan in Greater Manchester, said: \"I get the point that Andy's making.\"",
      "She said he was calling for a smaller inquiry into specific issues that the one he had instigated could not pick up.",
      "The culture secretary described it as \"astonishing\" that some Greater Manchester Police officers had refused to take part in that local inquiry and could not be compelled to do so.",
      "But, she added, she did not agree with Burnham, because the Jay inquiry, set up by Theresa May's government, had taken evidence from thousands of victims and addressed the issues he had raised.",
      "\"That inquiry found what every inquiry has found, that young girls weren't believed because they were young, they were female, and they were working-class, and that the systems that were supposed to protect them protected themselves instead of protecting those brave young victims,\" Nandy said.",
      "She denied the government was \"cross\" with Burnham, saying the whole point of devolution was \"that we want to make sure that people's views are heard from across the country\".",
      "Asked whether the government was ruling out another inquiry, Ms Nandy said: \"The reason I think that people have heard from us that there may at some point in the future be another inquiry is because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard.\"",
      "On Monday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government would begin implementing Prof Jay's call for mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse, with further details to be set out in the coming weeks.",
      "The prime minister has warned that launching a further inquiry could delay action on tackling child sexual abuse, though he noted there was no \"fixed view\" among survivors on whether one was needed.",

      "The Tories accused Labour MPs of having \"turned a blind eye to justice\" for victims of grooming gangs.",
      "The bill, which includes measures aimed at protecting children and tougher rules around home-schooling, as well as changes to academies, would have been killed off if MPs had voted through the Tory amendment.",
      "Burnham said that while he supported a limited, new inquiry, MPs were right to vote down Conservative \"opportunism\".",
      "Labour peer and former deputy party leader Baroness [Harriet] Harman has also said issues raised by the grooming gangs scandal should be looked at in closer detail.",
      "\"Whether it's a task force, whether it's more action plans, whether it's a mini inquiry on this, this is something that we need to develop resilience in,\" she told Sky News.",
      "Ministers have suggested they are keeping an open mind about a future investigation if it becomes clear that survivors want one, along with the implementation of Prof Jay's recommendations.",
      "But Nandy said she had spoken to survivors who had given evidence to the Jay inquiry and had begun to lose faith in the process leading to concrete action.",
      "\"We can not possibly ask victims to go through that again when not one single one of those recommendations has been implemented.",
      "\"Our message to victims is we understand the time for action is long overdue and we are acting. The time for talking is over, the time for action is now,\" she said.",
      "However, she added the government was not ruling out a future inquiry \"because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard\".",

      "National Gas, which owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of the UK's gas transmission system, said the \"overall picture across Great Britain's eight main gas storage sites remains healthy with average levels at just over 60% across the board\".",
      "It added it was \"well-placed to respond to demand this winter\".",
      "Energy prices rise with warnings of more pain to come",
      "Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that there are various gas pipelines running from Europe to the UK, and the country also gets shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG).",
      "Given household energy prices are currently capped until the end of March, any shortage would be very unlikely to affect consumer bills, he said.",
      "If there was a short-term spike in wholesale prices, this could affect some business customers, he said.",
      "However, the weather in the UK is forecast to become milder from Tuesday meaning a spike may not happen, he added.",

      "The government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".",
      "Hydrogen push",
      "Gas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.",
      "The UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.",
      "About half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "This was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "There is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.",
      "If the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.",
      "Centrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.",

      "They include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.",

      "\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said.",

      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "Lammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is.",
      "When applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.",
      "And as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset.",

    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",
      "Bidenomics without the money and without Biden is much too thin. A more detailed strategy for sustained growth is needed, and in short order.",

      "It did, however, approve 89% of planning applications for housing in the year to June 2024, considerably higher than the national rate of 71%.",
      "Portsmouth, on the south coast, also has a very stretching target. The local council is being asked to deliver 1,021 new homes per year, almost nine times the 120 it delivered on average over the most recent three years.",
      "Hastings has been tasked with a smaller total: 710. But this is still five times the 142 it has delivered on average in recent years.",
      "Portsmouth approved 74% of residential planning applications in the year to June 2024 and Hastings 75%.",
      "Councils were consulted on the targets last summer, with many expressing concerns they were \"unrealistic\", and the numbers were revised.",

      "Councillor Darren Sanders, cabinet member for housing at Portsmouth City Council, said the target \"does not work\" because \"most of the city is an island\" with a dense population and \"important heritage and natural assets\".",
      "\"Portsmouth has approved more than 4,000 new homes in 2023 and 2024. Any lack of delivery is down to the rising cost of development,\" he said, \"not whether the council approves them.\"",
      "Sevenoaks councillor Julia Thornton said it was a \"top priority\" to protect greenbelt land, but added: \"We will have a duty to do everything possible to meet the government's new housing targets.\"",

      "The Construction Industry Training Board estimates the sector needs to attract the equivalent of 50,300 extra workers per year to meet the levels of work expected.",
      "There are also concerns about the availability of basic building materials including bricks and timber.",
      "The Construction Leadership Council has warned a shortage of these could hinder the government's ability to get near its target.",
      "Finally, many housing experts doubt private housebuilders are capable of delivering enough new homes each year to reach the targets.",
      "This is because private housebuilders have a commercial interest in not building so many new homes that their average price declines.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",
      "Interactive tool developed by Allison Shultes, Scott Jarvis and Steven Connor",
      "About the data",
      "Annual data on new homes for England comes from the government's \"net additional dwellings\" statistics.",

      "The targets are the government's new \"local housing need\" calculations, released following a public consultation.",
      "Planning statistics are taken from quarterly data and combine applications decided for \"minor\" housing developments (fewer than 10 homes) and \"major\" schemes (10 homes or more).",
      "The planning data for England is at local authority level. Applications decided by special authorities, such as those in charge of national parks, are not included.",
      "We have included the latest data on new housebuilding \"completions\" by local authority area for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the 1.5 million homes target applies only in England.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chancellor may face the prospect of breaking her own Budget rules",
    "story": [
      "Economists have warned that the government is \"on course\" to miss its own Budget borrowing targets after interest rates for UK long-term borrowing rose to their highest levels this century.",
      "The official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will start the process of updating its forecast next month to be presented to parliament in late March.",
      "The rising cost of borrowing means \"there is a significant chance that the OBR will judge that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is on course to miss her main fiscal rule\", according to Ruth Gregory from Capital Economics.",
      "The yield on the 30-year gilt reached 5.35% on Wednesday, surpassing a previous high in August 1998.",
      "Meanwhile, the yield on a 10 year bond surged on Wednesday to its highest since October 2008, to reach 4.784%.",
      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",
      "No.10 said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\" and \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\" saying that only the OBR's forecast is an accurate predication of the government's room for manoeuvre.",
      "The clear indication from the government is that although they will not hold another Budget in March, any necessary adjustment would have to come in terms of some new spending cuts.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a \u00a32bn auction of 30 year UK government debt sold at an effective interest rate of 5.18%.",
      "The Debt Management Office, a part of Treasury, effectively paid the highest interest rates for these very long term loans that have been since 1998.",
      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",
      "The rise in rates has affected the US and the UK more, and less so continental Europe. The tick-up in UK market rates after the Budget, initially faded by early December. But now British borrowing rates are moving up alongside US ones.",
      "Stagnant growth and sticky inflation have raised concerns about so-called \"stagflation\". Markets are starting to question the inflationary impacts of incoming President Donald Trump's trade and tax policies.",
      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation. And those questions are now occurring against the backdrop of the Trump trade tumult affecting global markets for borrowing. It's a bumpy start to 2025."

      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

    "story": [
      "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.",
      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",

      "With daylight came more onlookers on New Year's Eve - followed by the KSA team and the media.",
      "Mukuku had never seen such activity. When the object was carted away later that day by the KSA, the buzz gave way to concerns about what the villagers had had in their midst.",
      "The KSA said its preliminary assessments indicated the object was \"a separation ring\" from a space launch rocket.",
      "\"Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere or to fall over unoccupied areas, such as the oceans,\" its statement said the next day.",
      "No-one was injured when it had fallen but some in Mukuku began to complain that the impact of the crash had caused damage to nearby houses.",
      "Christine Kionga, who lives about a kilometre from the crash site, showed us cracks in the concrete of some of the buildings in her home compound. She said they had appeared after the crash.",
      "Other neighbours alleged the structural integrity of their homes had also been affected - allegations that are yet to be substantiated.",
      "\"The government needs to find the owners of this object, and get compensation for those affected by it,\" Mukuku resident Benson Mutuku told the BBC.",
      "There were reports in the local media that some residents had begun to complain of feeling unwell after exposure to the metallic ring though there was no confirmation from those we spoke to when we visited - nor from the authorities or the KSA.",
      "Nonetheless Mr Mutuku said there were concerns about the long-term effects of possible space radiation.",
      "\"This is a space object and we have heard in other similar incidents that there have been effects of radiation affecting even future generations and there is that fear in this community.\"",
      "However tests run later by the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority revealed that while the metal ring did have higher radiation levels than the area in which it was found, they were not at a level harmful to humans.",
      "Engineers from the KSA, which was established in 2017 to promote, co-ordinate and regulate space-related activities in the East African nation, are continuing to run other tests to find out more about the object.",
      "The KSA director general said it was lucky that no significant damage was done when the object hurtled to Earth.",
      "\"The ultimate responsibility for any damage or injury caused by that space object is on the state in whose jurisdiction that operator may have launched the object,\" Brigadier Hillary Kipkosgey told the BBC.",
      "According to the Outer Space Treaty, overseen by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, \"states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects\".",
      "\"[The ring] is a common item in many rockets and many space objects so it difficult to attribute it to a specific rocket or space object but we have leads but as I said our investigations are not conclusive,\" Brigadier Kipkosgey said.",
      "The BBC showed pictures of the object to the UK Space Agency to get the thoughts of its experts.",
      "\"The most plausible object it could be is the upper stage separation ring from an Ariane rocket in 2008,\" its launch director, Matt Archer, said.",
      "\"The satellites are fine, but the actual rocket body has come through and de-orbited.\"",
      "The Ariane was Europe's main rocket launch vehicle, helping more than 230 satellites into orbit, before it was retired in 2023.",
      "It seems the separation ring may have been orbiting Earth for 16 years before making its unexpected appearance in Mukuku.",
      "This is not the first incident of space junk appearing in East Africa.",
      "Just over a year and a half ago some suspected space debris fell over several villages in western Uganda.",
      "And a few days ago, on 8 January, there were unconfirmed reports of what was believed to be space debris burning brightly in the skies above northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia.",
      "As the space industry grows, it is predicted that such incidents will become more frequent - and African governments may need to invest in ways to better detect this speeding space rubbish.",
      "Nasa estimates there are more than 6,000 tonnes of space debris in orbit at the moment.",
      "There are many different estimates about the chances of such junk hitting someone, but most are in the one-in-10,000 range.",
      "Such statistics are little comfort for Mukuku's residents, who cannot help thinking of what damage the ring could have caused had it landed in the centre of the village instead of on farmland.",
      "\"We need assurances from the government that it won't happen again,\" said Mr Mutuku.",

      "It said a previous survey had recorded bumblebees and honeybees between Christmas and New Year at locations across the UK, including the Highlands.",

      "The insects, an important pollinator, normally hibernate through winter into spring.",

      "\"This year one of my colleagues based in Aberdeen spotted active worker bumblebees over the Christmas break.",
      "\"The fact that there are active workers means not only have the queens awakened from hibernation but they have gone to the extent of starting new nests.\"",

      "He added: \"If this happens there will be no new queens produced meaning far fewer to emerge in spring further feeding the known decline in bumblebees.\"",

      "Over winter, adult ticks do not hibernate and instead shelter from low temperatures in long vegetation.",
      "Mr Hetherington said: \"This means that they are still potentially active and the period around 28 December was relatively warm for the time of year, a likely consequence of climate change is increased periods of tick activity in the same way that bumblebees have been spotted on the wing across Scotland this December.\"",

      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",

      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",

    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and the UK's Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",
      "That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast.",
      "For workers in Guangzhou, this can be a challenge.",
      "\"Shein has its pros and cons,\" one factory owner told us. \"The good thing is the order is eventually big, but profit is low and it's fixed.\"",
      "Shein, given its size and influence, is a hard bargainer. So factory owners have to cut costs elsewhere, often resulting in lower staff wages.",
      "\"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\"",

      "Netanyahu's office said he had updated Biden on instructions he had given to senior negotiators in Doha \"in order to advance the release of the hostages\".",
      "During Sunday's call, which was the first to be publicly announced since October, Biden \"stressed the immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza and return of the hostages with a surge in humanitarian aid enabled by a stoppage in the fighting under the deal\".",

    "story": [
      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

      "Standing at a lectern at Washington's National Cathedral last Thursday, Joe Biden delivered the eulogy for former President Jimmy Carter while three other former presidents \u2013 Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama \u2013 and the once and future president, Donald Trump, looked on.",
      "Each spectating president had achieved the validation of the American people (re-election to a second term) that has eluded Biden. And as Biden, whose term comes to an end next week, paid tribute to Carter, a fellow one-term president, it was hard not to draw other parallels too.",
      "\"Many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality, he saw well into the future,\" Biden said of Carter. He went on to note Carter's accomplishments in advancing civil rights, his work on peace and nuclear non-proliferation, and his efforts to protect the environment.",
      "Earlier in the week, however, Biden was making the case for his own legacy and how history should judge him.",
      "\"I hope that history says that I came in and I had a plan how to restore the economy and reestablish America's leadership in the world,\" he said in a television interview. \"And I hope it records that I did it with honesty and integrity; that I said what was on my mind.\"",
      "Whether that happens is subject to vigorous discussion - but he exits the White House with his approval ratings near their lowest mark of his presidency. Only 39% have a positive view, according to the latest Gallup survey, down from 57% at the start of his term.",
      "Next week, the man he defeated in 2020 returns to power, marking what must feel to him like a dour end to a presidency.",
      "Biden had his accomplishments \u2013 adroitly shepherding complex investment and infrastructure legislation through Congress despite narrow majorities, strengthening and expanding Nato, and appointing a remarkable number of diverse judges to the federal bench  \u2013 but at least for now, that is overshadowed.",
      "His current place in history is as the Democratic interregnum between the two Trump presidential terms. A blip, rather than a pivot.",
      "\"He'd like his legacy to be that he rescued us from Trump,\" says author and Democratic strategist Susan Estrich. \"But sadly, for him, his legacy is Trump again. He is the bridge from Trump One to Trump Two.\"",
      "It didn't have to be this way. Biden and his team were buffeted by events \u2013 some within his control and some outside it. Many of the most damaging developments were entirely predictable, however \u2013 and, in fact, predicted - yet the president and his administration appeared to be caught flat-footed.",
      "For that, they paid a high price.",
      "From Kabul chaos to early 'missteps'",
      "Biden's first misstep as president came half a world away, in the chaos that unfolded during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.",
      "The exit had been negotiated during the final months of the Trump administration, but Biden backed it \u2013 despite warnings from some of his military advisors.",
      "Those dire predictions proved prophetic, as Kabul descended into panic and unrest.",
      "By the end of that month, Biden's Gallup approval rating had dipped below 50% for the first time \u2013 a mark it would never again reach.",
      "On the domestic front, the situation for the president was equally inauspicious. By summer, US inflation had surpassed 5% for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she believed the spike was \"transitory\". Biden called it \"temporary\". Some outside the administration, most notably Obama's Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, thought otherwise.",
      "By the time inflation reached its peak a year later, at 9.1% in June 2022, Yellen and Biden had admitted they miscalculated.",
      "Americans did not forget or forgive, however. And although the monthly inflation numbers had dropped below 3% by summer 2024, unemployment remained low, economic growth was steady and the US had outperformed the world's other industrialised nations, voters continued to have a pessimistic view of the economy.",
      "Other issues followed this pattern: The Biden administration was slow to respond to the post-Covid spike in undocumented migration at the US-Mexico border.",
      "And it was seemingly caught off-guard by the disruptive impact the Republican-backed programme of relocating migrants to Democratic-run northern cities would have on government services far from the border.",
      "Shortages in Covid tests and infant formula, a dramatic increase in the price of eggs, the end of Roe v Wade abortion protections, and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza \u2013 for every seemingly unanticipated fire the Biden administration addressed, two new ones would emerge.",
      "The challenges were, in fact, daunting \u2013 ones that felled incumbent leaders in democracies around the world.",
      "But for Biden and the Democrats, hoping to prove that they were a competent and effective counterpoint not just to Trump but to global authoritarian regimes, the stakes were high.",
      "'An elderly man with a poor memory'",
      "Amid all of this, responses from the administration were sometimes glaringly off-key. When asked during a television interview about raising oil production in America to reduce gas prices, in November 2021, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm responded with a laugh.",
      "\"That is hilarious,\" she said. \"Would that I had the magic wand.\"",
      "Biden \u2013 once regarded as a gifted communicator and orator - appeared less able to connect with the American people. Signs of his advancing years were also showing.",
      "\"Watching Biden speak, I'm like, oh my God, this is a different person,\" said a senior White House official who served in the early years of the Biden administration and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "\"Maybe it's simply that when you're there every day, you don't see it.\"",
      "A report by Robert Hur, a special counsel appointed to investigate Biden's handling of classified documents, referred to the president as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\", setting off a round of hand-wringing among Democrats.",
      "Biden's interactions with the media were curtailed, and his public appearances tightly scripted. His verbal miscues and stumbles became fodder for Republican attacks. But Biden pressed on, determined to seek and win a second term in office.",
      "Biden's people: His inner circle",
      "During his presidency, Biden surrounded himself with veterans of government service. His secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had been one of his top foreign policy advisors since his days in the Senate. Merrick Garland, a distinguished appellate court judge and Barack Obama's ill-fated 2016 pick for the Supreme Court, was tabbed for attorney general. Yellen, his pick for treasury, had previously chaired the Federal Reserve.",
      "Within the White House, Biden chose Ron Klain \u2013 who had worked in Democratic presidential administrations for decades \u2013 as his chief of staff. Mike Donilon, another Biden veteran, served as a senior advisor.",
      "The team was particularly successful at managing the narrow majorities in the House and the Senate, notching early legislative victories even in the face of unified Republican resistance and reluctance from centrists in his own party.",
      "Biden's \"American Rescue Plan\", which passed just two months after he took office, included nearly $2 trillion in new government spending. It expanded healthcare subsidies, and funded the distribution of Covid vaccines and a payment programme that cut child poverty in half, to 5%.",
      "Later that year, Democrats and some Republicans joined to pass an infrastructure investment bill, which included $1tn in new spending on transportation, clean energy, water, broadband and other construction programmes.",
      "Others followed, marking a legislative agenda that few first-term presidents in the modern era could match \u2013 but it came with what some critics see as a fatal flaw.",
      "Brent Cebul, an associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that Biden's efforts were too focused on shifting policies that take years to translate into economic benefits for average American workers.",
      "\"I think that the time horizon associated with those big pieces of legislation was way out of sync with the exigencies of the presidential election,\" he said.",
      "Biden would have been better served finding ways to bring the tangible benefits to voters more quickly \u2013 a sentiment Biden himself expressed during a recent newspaper interview.",
      "'Infighting and frustration' from within",
      "His team also proved less able when success was measured not in laws enacted but in the daily messaging battle against a political opposition that was growing increasingly assertive.",
      "A senior Biden official said that the White House team was more decisive early on in his presidency.",
      "\"As things started to become a grind and you lose that sense of getting big things done, it can give way to infighting and frustration,\" they admitted, adding that it was their sense that the circle around Biden became more insular as the pressure built.",
      "After a two-year respite, his political opponents launched investigations, held hearings (into the Afghanistan withdrawal, the Biden family's business dealings and more) and, in September 2023, formally initiated a presidential impeachment inquiry. All the while, Biden's public approval languished in the low 40s.",
      "Biden's presidency should be seen in two halves, says Mr Cebul. The first was more accomplished. The second was less focused.",
      "\"Biden's sense that the US was macro-economically doing quite well led him and his advisors to take their eyes off the ball when many, many Americans were still very much hurting.\"",
      "A beleaguered election campaign",
      "On 25 April, 2023, Biden made his presidential bid official in a campaign video warning that Trump \"extremists\" were threatening America.",
      "Over the following months, there would be more warnings of the danger Trump posed to American democracy. He would tout his economic plan \u2013 embracing the label \"Bidenomics\" - and point to how inflation was dropping while the economy was still growing.",
      "I travelled with Biden on a June 2023 trip to Chicago, where he held a reception for deep-pocketed donors and gave a speech on the economy in an historic downtown post office.",
      "\"Bidenomics is about the future,\" he said.\"Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American dream.\"",
      "Mr Cebul believes that was a bad move.",
      "\"For him to then spend most of the spring and the early summer basically talking about how he's the most successful economic president in modern history, it was just so discordant,\" he said.",
      "\"Not only was the message out of sync, he was also just a terrible messenger.\"",
      "In Chicago, as in many of his speeches, Biden's delivery was at times halting. His words sometimes mumbled and his syntax mangled.",
      "Through it all, however, Biden was telling aides that he believed he was the man best positioned to defeat Trump \u2013 that he had done it once, and he would do it again. And those aides vigorously pushed back whenever anyone questioned Biden's abilities.",
      "\"I'm not a young guy, that's no secret,\" Biden said in a campaign advert. \"But here's the deal: I understand how to get things done for the American people.\"",
      "Hamas, Hunter and final hurdles",
      "In the autumn, Biden confronted yet another crisis - following the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, he quickly cautioned Israel not to overreact or overreach in its response to the bloodshed.",
      "As with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the president turned his attention to world affairs. But unlike Ukraine, during which Biden assembled a unified western coalition against the invasion, the continued US support of Israel eroded enthusiasm and support for Biden in some quarters at home.",
      "At the same time, Biden was confronting his son Hunter's growing legal troubles \u2013 a June trial and conviction on gun charges and, perhaps more concerning for the president, an indictment on tax-related violations that involved Hunter's foreign business dealings.",
      "The airing of family discord and pain was, at the very least, a distraction and an emotional drain on the president. His ultimate decision to pardon his son, made after November's election, was condemned by many, including some allies.",
      "Ultimately, Biden's presidential bid \u2013 and his presidency \u2013 came crashing down in late June on a stage in Atlanta during a debate with Trump. His confused and at times incomprehensible performance dealt his campaign a mortal blow that seemingly confirmed Republican attacks \u2013 and Democratic fears \u2013 about his advancing age.",
      "But eventually, after Trump defiantly responded to a failed assassination attempt and held a boisterous, unified national party convention in mid-July, Biden dropped out of the race.",
      "Trump's victory over Kamala Harris, Biden's hand-picked successor, ensured that the final electoral judgement on Biden's half-century political career would be one of rejection and defeat.",
      "What would Biden's legacy have been if he had simply stepped aside  \u2013 \"passed the torch\" in his words \u2013 without seeking a second term? No video campaign launch. No grasping for campaign messages or Trump debate disaster. Instead, a robust race for the Democratic nomination with Biden floating above it all.",
      "\"We should have had primaries,\" argues Ms Estrich. \"His successor would have had time to make the case.\"",
      "In the end, Biden's age and Trump's enduring appeal were the fires that his administration could never put out, and the ones that ultimately consumed his presidency.",
      "In exactly one week, Trump will take the oath of office and will likely set about dismantling much of what Biden accomplished over the past four years. How effective he is at doing this will go a long way towards determining Biden's lasting legacy.",
      "A few weeks ago, I asked Attorney General Garland how he thought history would judge Biden and this administration.",
      "\"I'll leave that to the historians,\" he replied.",
      "That, in the end, is all Biden has left.",

      "Yoon cited threats from \"anti-state forces\" and North Korea to justify his martial law declaration. However, it soon became clear that his move had been spurred not by external threats but by his own domestic political troubles.",
      "News of Yoon's salary increase has drawn criticism among South Koreans, some of whom say they cannot believe he is still getting paid - let alone getting a increment - while he is suspended.",

      "\"It all started as a small passion project,\" says Fabriccio D\u00edaz, 28, who, together with his wife Luc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, 25, runs the only fully operational photo film development lab in Central America from their apartment in Guatemala City.",
      "\"Now we have over 60 clients a month and have developed over 800 rolls just this year,\" he adds.",
      "Arca Film Lab has been in high demand this year and is the only photo film development lab in Central America that develops every type of analogue photography film, which includes the rather complicated process of developing positives in a process known as E-6.",
      "Fabriccio, who studied cinematography, explains that the great inaccessibility of high-quality film development services in Central America gave him the first decisive push to learn how to develop his first film.",
      "\"When we started experimenting and developing film in our apartment, friends started asking us to develop film for them and it all just took off somehow,\" Luc\u00eda recalls.",
      "And so, the Arca Film Lab was born in September 2023 as a simple Instagram page offering film development services in Guatemala.",
      "The couple have taught themselves most of the skills needed to develop film by watching YouTube videos and by reaching out to other film labs internationally and asking for tips.",
      "\"We were surprised that so many people responded to our questions. A lot of the veterans in the photo development world helped us out by sharing their experiences and tricks. We are really grateful for that,\" says Fabriccio.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda's love of photography is not confined to developing film, though. The couple also organise \"photo walks\" in which a group of people get together in Antigua, the old centre of Guatemala City, to take pictures and experiment with old analogue cameras.",
      "For young analogue photography enthusiasts like Iv\u00e1n Ortiz, 22, snapping photos with a camera which is older than he is gives him something modern cameras cannot compete with.",
      "\"It's like having nostalgia for a generation we were never a part of,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Iv\u00e1n says that older people do not always get the recent hype for old cameras and film. \"They just don't understand our perspective,\" he explains.",
      "\"We live in a world where everything is digital and fast. Through analogue photography, I have to make conscious decisions about my photos and focus solely on the act of photographing. And the best part of it is that you have something physical afterwards, and not just another data file,\" he adds.",
      "Having physical photos to hold is also something that Steven L\u00f3pez from the US highlights as an advantage of analogue photography.",
      "The 33-year-old is travelling through Central America to document the last traces of Mayan culture and always carries a 35mm analogue camera with him.",
      "\"Photography and especially analogue photography is just the best way to document and experience cultures. Every time I get back from travelling and get the developed film back it's like Christmas!\", he tells the BBC.",
      "The community of analogue photography enthusiasts in Central America may be growing quickly, but the challenges are greater than in other places.",
      "\"It is really hard to get analogue cameras here and it is even harder to get them in good condition,\" explains 26-year-old Ronald Ottoniel, who went on the photo walk to buy new rolls of film and turn in others to be developed.",
      "And there are other hurdles, too.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda explain that the process of buying and importing the chemicals needed to develop positive film has been extremely complicated because the import of these chemicals is closely monitored by the state and requires special permits, which has made it a painstakingly long ordeal.",
      "\"Many other labs don't offer the E-6 processing just because it's so complicated to import the chemicals,\" says Fabriccio.",
      "Their business may be expanding, but Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda are determined to make sure it does not lose the personal touch and passion which inspired it in the first place.",
      "Luc\u00eda explains how sometimes clients \"put little sweets into the packages they send us and sometimes we send a handwritten note back\".",
      "\"It's important to us that this is not a mass-producing business, but that every client is [treated as] an individual,\" she adds.",
      "Around the world, photo labs use large machines that develop the film almost completely automatically, but in the humble apartment of Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda, the process is very much \"hands-on\".",
      "For colour and positive (E-6) film the temperature of the chemicals and the time the film is exposed to them has to be exact, otherwise, the entire film roll will turn out badly.",
      "\"The beginning was definitely not easy with this entire process, but after developing over 800 film rolls these processes come like second nature to us,\" recalls Fabriccio.",
      "\"But the first time we developed the positive films, the E-6 process, we were so nervous because we had invested so much in the chemicals and the roll. But when it came out well and we were able to see these lively colours of the positive film it's always very exciting,\" he adds.",
      "Another indispensable member of the Arca Film Lab is Toto, the four-month-old cat that is, according to Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda, in charge of quality control and roves around during the entire development process.",
      "The developed film rolls are then transferred from the kitchen to the bathroom, as it is the most dust-free space in the house.",
      "There they dry, to be later scanned in a high-resolution Nikon scanner, which Fabriccio says is the highest-resolution film scanner in Central America.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda have now also expanded to El Salvador, where they regularly collect and sell film rolls.",
      "The young couple remains ambitious and in the future, they say they hope to establish a strong relationship with CineStill and Eastman Kodak andto expand to developing cine film rolls, which would include a complicated process known as ECN-2.",

      "Darim was proud of her work. So, sitting alone on the floor of her small studio apartment, she posted the trailer on social media. Almost immediately, she was flooded with thousands of abusive messages, including death and rape threats.",
      "Young male gamers had taken issue with a single frame in the trailer, in which the female character could be seen holding her thumb and forefinger close together.",
      "They thought it resembled a hand gesture used by a radical online feminist community almost a decade ago to poke fun at the size of Korean men's penises.",
      "\"There were insults I'd never heard before, they were disgusting and inhumane,\" said Darim, which is not her real name. One read: \"You've just sabotaged your job.\"",
      "Messages then started piling into Darim's studio and the game developer claiming she was a feminist and demanding she be fired. Within hours, the company pulled the promotional video.",
      "Darim had become the latest victim in a series of vicious online witch hunts, in which men in South Korea attack women they suspect of having feminist views. They bombard them with abuse and try to get them sacked.",
      "This is part of a growing backlash to feminism, in which feminists have been branded man-haters who deserve to be punished. The witch hunts are having a chilling effect on women, with many now scared to admit they are feminists.",
      "This is forcing the movement underground, in a country where gender discrimination is still deeply entrenched. South Korea has the largest gender pay gap in the OECD, a group of the world's rich countries.",
      "The hunts are often spearheaded by young male video gamers, and target women who work in the industry, like Darim, though recently they have spread to other professions.",
      "They look for anything that resembles what they term the 'finger-pinching gesture' and use it as proof that men-hating women are surreptitiously mocking them.",
      "Once they spot a supposed sign, the hunt begins. \"They decide that a dark, evil feminist is hiding in the company, and her life should be ruined,\" explained Minsung Kim, a 22-year-old male gamer who, concerned by these witch hunts, set up an organisation to support the victims.",
      "The witch hunters track down all female employees at the company in question, and trawl their social media accounts, searching for any evidence of feminism. Way back on Darim's timeline, they found an 'offending' post.",
      "Darim in fact had nothing to do with the disputed part of the animation, but her studio was rattled by the torrent of abuse \u2013 especially after Nexon, the gaming company, suddenly removed all the studio's artwork from their roster and issued an apology to customers.",
      "\"My company and CEO were in a panic,\" said Darim. \"I thought I was going to be fired, and I'd never be able to work in animation again.\"",
      "Then Minsung's organisation stepped in. They urged her studio to ignore the gamers and offered to pay Darim's legal fees so she could report the abuse. \"We said these demands will never end, you need to nip this in the bud now,\" he said. The studio listened, and Darim kept her job.",
      "But similar witch hunts have worked, in the gaming industry and beyond, and they are becoming more frequent. In one case, a young illustrator lost her job after a handful of disgruntled gamers stormed the company's office demanding she be removed.",
      "And it is not just Korean companies that have capitulated. Last year, the international car maker Renault suspended one of its female employees after she was accused of making the finger-pinching gesture while moving her hands in a promotional presentation.",
      "\"These anti-feminists are getting more organised; their playbook is getting more specific,\" said Minsung. \"By taking a hand gesture that everyone makes and turning it into a scarlet letter they can brand literally anyone an evil feminist,\" he said.",
      "Because the companies are folding to these baseless accusations, the instigators of these hunts have become emboldened, he said. \"They are confident now that when you accuse someone of feminism, you can ruin their career.\"",
      "Minsung knows, because not long ago he was one of these men. He used to belong to the anti-feminist forums. \"We are exposed to the uncensored internet unimaginably young,\" he said, having joined the forums aged nine.",
      "It was only when Minsung traded video games for playing real-life games, including Dungeons and Dragons, that he met women, and his views shifted. He became, in his words, an \"ardent feminist\".",
      "In South Korea, women commonly suffer discrimination and misogyny both at work and at home. But as they have fought to improve their rights, many young men have started to believe they are the ones being discriminated against.",
      "The backlash began in the mid-2010s, following a surge of feminist activism. During this time, women took to the streets in protest at sexual violence and the widespread use of hidden cameras that secretly film women using toilets and changing rooms - around 5,000 to 6,000 cases are reported annually.",
      "\"Young men saw women becoming vocal and were threatened by their rise,\" said Myungji Yang, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawai'i Manoa, who has interviewed dozens of young Korean men. \"They learn about feminism from online forums, which carry the most radical caricature of feminists,\" she said. \"This has given them a distorted idea of what feminism is.\"",
      "One of their grievances is the 18-month military service men must complete. Once they leave the military they often \"feel entitled\" to a good job, said Hyun Mee Kim, a professor of cultural anthropology at Yonsei University in Seoul, who studies feminism.",
      "As more women have entered the workforce, and jobs have become harder to get, some men feel their opportunities are being unfairly taken away.",
      "These feelings have been validated by South Korea's now disgraced and suspended President, Yoon Suk Yeol, who came to power in 2022 on an anti-feminist platform, claiming gender discrimination no longer existed, and has since tried to dismantle the government's gender equality ministry.",
      "More surprising than these views themselves, is that the men who hold them have such power over major companies.",
      "Editing out fingers",
      "I travelled to Pangyo, the Silicon Valley of South Korea, to meet a woman who has worked in the gaming industry for 20 years. After Darim's case, her company started to edit all its games, removing the fingers from characters' hands, turning them into fists, to avoid complaints.",
      "\"It's exhausting and frustrating\" to work like this, she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"The idea that a hand gesture can be seen as an attack on men is absurd and companies should be ignoring it.\"",
      "When I asked why they were not, she told me that many developers share the gamers' anti-feminist views. \"For all those outside yelling, there are those on the inside who also believe things are bad.\"",
      "Then there is the financial cost. The men threaten to boycott the games unless the companies act.",
      "\"The gaming companies think the anti-feminists are the largest source of their revenue,\" said Minsung. After Darim's company, Studio Ppuri, was targeted, it said it lost nearly two thirds of its contracts with gaming companies.",
      "Studio Ppuri, did not respond to our questions, but both Nexon, the game developer, and Renault Korea told us they stood against all forms of discrimination and prejudice.",
      "There is evidence the authorities are also capitulating to the anti-feminists' demands. When Darim reported her abuse to the police, they refused to take her case.",
      "They said because the finger-pinching gesture was taboo, it was \"logical\" that she, as a feminist, had been attacked. \"I was astonished,\" she said. \"Why would the authorities not protect me?\"",
      "Following outrage from feminist organisations, the police backtracked and are now investigating. In a statement, Seocho district police told the BBC their initial decision to close the case had been \"insufficient\" and they were \"making all efforts to identify the suspects\".",
      "The case left Darim's lawyer, Yu-kyung Beom, dumbfounded. \"If you want to say that you're a feminist in South Korea, you have to be very brave or insane,\" she said.",
      "Beaten up for having short hair",
      "In November 2023, the violence spilled offline and into real life. A young woman, who we are calling Jigu, was working alone in a convenience store late at night, when a man walked in and started attacking her.",
      "\"He said 'hey, you're a feminist, right? You look like a feminist with your short hair',\" Jigu told me as she apprehensively recounted the night. The man pushed her to the ground and started kicking her. \"I kept going in and out of consciousness. I thought I could die.\"",
      "Jigu did not consider herself a feminist. She just liked having short hair and thought it suited her. The attack has left her with permanent injuries. Her left ear is damaged, and she wears a hearing aid.",
      "\"I feel like I've become a completely different person,\" she said. \"I don't smile as much. Some days it is agony just to stay alive, the memory of that day is still so clear.\"",
      "Her assailant was sent to prison for three years, and for the first time a South Korean court ruled this was a misogynistically motivated crime: in effect, that Jigu had been attacked for looking like a feminist.",
      "During the attack, the man said he belonged to an extreme anti-feminist group, New Men's Solidarity. Its leader, In-kyu Bae, has called on men to confront feminists. So, one evening, as he held a live-streaming event in Gangnam, a flashy neighbourhood in Seoul, I went to try to talk to him.",
      "\"I'm here to tell you these feminists are staining the country with hatred,\" he shouted from the roof of a black van kitted out with loudspeakers.",
      "\"That psychopath [who attacked Jigu] was not a member of our group. We don't have members, we are a YouTube channel,\" he told me as he simultaneously broadcast to thousands of subscribers. A small group of young men who had come to watch in person were cheering along.",
      "\"We've never encouraged anyone to use violence. In fact, the violent ones are the feminist groups. They're shaming men's genitals,\" he added.",
      "Last year, Mr Bae and several of his supporters were convicted of defaming and insulting a feminist activist after harassing her for more than two years.",
      "Anti-feminist views have become so widespread that Yuri Kim, the director of Korea Women's Trade Union, recently established a committee to track cases of what she describes as \"feminism censorship\". She found that some women have been questioned about their stance on feminism in job interviews, while at work women commonly face comments like \"all feminists need to die\".",
      "According to Prof Kim, the feminism academic, men are using now feminist threats in the office as a way to harass and control their female colleagues - it is their way of saying 'we are watching you; you should behave yourself'.",
      "Such harassment is proving effective. Last year, a pair of scholars coined the phrase \"quiet feminism\", to describe the impact of what they say is a \"pervasive everyday backlash\".",
      "Gowoon Jung and Minyoung Moon found that although women held feminist beliefs they did not feel safe disclosing them in public. Women I spoke to said they were even afraid to cut their hair short, while others said feminism had become so synonymous with hating men they did not associate with the cause.",
      "A 2024 IPSOS poll of 31 countries found only 24% of women in South Korea defined themselves as feminist, compared to an average of 45%, and down from 33% in 2019.",
      "Prof Kim worries the consequences will be severe. By being forced to conceal their feminist values, she argues women are being stripped of their ability to fight against gender inequality, which penetrates workplaces, politics and public life.",
      "Feminists are now busy brainstorming ways to put an end to the witch hunts. One clear answer is legal change. In South Korea there is no blanket anti-discrimination law to protect women and prevent them being fired for their views.",
      "It has been repeatedly blocked by politicians, largely because it would support gay and transgender people, with anti-feminists, and even some trans-exclusionary feminists, now lobbying against it.",
      "Minsung believes the only way to strip the witch hunters of their powers is for the companies and the authorities to stand up to them. They make up a small fraction of men in South Korea, they just have loud voices and a bizarrely oversized influence, he argues.",
      "Since her attack, Jigu now proudly calls herself a feminist. \"I want to reach out to other victims like me, and if even one woman has the strength to grab my hand, I want to help.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:23:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A businessman was shot dead in India 100 years ago. Then, a sensational tale unfolded.",
    "story": [
      "It looked like an ordinary murder.",
      "One hundred years ago on this day - 12 January 1925 - a group of men attacked a couple on a car ride in a upmarket suburb in Bombay (now Mumbai) in colonial India, shooting the man dead and slashing the woman's face.",
      "But the story that unfolded brought global spotlight on the case, while its complexity put the country's then British rulers in a spot of bother, and eventually forced an Indian king to abdicate.",
      "Newspapers and magazines described the murder as \"perhaps the most sensational crime committed in British India\", and it became \"the talk of the city\" during the investigation and subsequent trial.",
      "The victim, Abdul Kadir Bawla, 25, was an influential textile businessman and the city's youngest municipal official. His female companion, Mumtaz Begum, 22, was a courtesan on the run from the harem of a princely state and had been staying with Bawla for the last few months.",
      "On the evening of the murder, Bawla and Mumtaz Begum were in the car with three others, driving in Malabar Hill, an affluent area along the shore of the Arabian Sea. Cars were a rarity in India at the time, and only the rich owned them.",
      "Suddenly, another car overtook them. Before they could react, it collided with theirs, forcing them to stop, according to intelligence and newspaper reports.",
      "The attackers showered expletives on Bawla and shouted \"get the lady out\", Mumtaz Begum later told the Bombay High Court.",
      "They then shot Bawla, who died a few hours later.",
      "A group of British soldiers, who had inadvertently taken a wrong turn on their way back from a golf game, heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene.",
      "They managed to catch one of the culprits, but one officer suffered gunshot wounds when an attacker opened fire at them.",
      "Before fleeing, the remaining attackers made two attempts to snatch the injured Mumtaz Begum from the British officers, who were trying to rush her to the hospital.",
      "The newspapers suggested that attackers' aim was likely abducting Mumtaz Begum, as Bawla - whom she had met while performing in Mumbai a few months earlier and had been living with since - had earlier received several threats for sheltering her.",
      "The Illustrated Weekly of India promised readers exclusive photographs of Mumtaz Begum, while the police planned to issue a daily bulletin to the press, Marathi newspaper Navakal reported.",
      "Even Bollywood found the case compelling enough to adapt it into a silent murder thriller within months.",
      "\"The case went beyond the usual murder mystery as it involved a rich and young tycoon, a slighted king, and a beautiful woman,\" says Dhaval Kulkarni, author of The Bawla Murder Case: Love, Lust and Crime in Colonial India.",
      "The attackers' footprints, as speculated in the media, led investigators to the influential princely state of Indore, which was a British ally. Mumtaz Begum, a Muslim, had lived in the harem of its Hindu king, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III.",
      "Mumtaz Begum was famed for her beauty. \"In her own class, it was said, Mumtaz was without a peer,\" KL Gauba wrote in his 1945 book, Famous Trials for Love and Murder.",
      "But the Maharaja's (king's) attempts to control her - preventing her from seeing her family alone and keeping her under constant surveillance - soured their relationship, says Kulkarni.",
      "\"I was kept under surveillance. I was allowed to see visitors and my relations but somebody always accompanied me,\" Mumtaz Begum testified in the court.",
      "In Indore, she gave birth to a baby girl, who died soon after.",
      "\"After my child was born, I was unwilling to stay at Indore. I was unwilling because the nurses killed the female child that was born,\" Mumtaz Begum told the court.",
      "Within months, she escaped to the northern Indian city of Amritsar, her mother's place of birth, but troubles followed.",
      "She was watched there too. Mumtaz Begum's stepfather told the court that the Maharaja wept and begged her to return. But she refused and moved to Bombay, where the surveillance continued.",
      "The trial confirmed what media had speculated following the murder: representatives of the Maharaja had indeed threatened Bawla with dire consequences if he continued to shelter Mumtaz Begum, but he had ignored the warnings.",
      "Following a lead given by Shafi Ahmed, the only attacker captured at the scene, the Bombay police arrested seven men from Indore.",
      "The investigation revealed links to the Maharaja that were hard to ignore. Most of the arrested men were employed by the Indore princely state, had applied for leave around the same time and were in Bombay at the time of the crime.",
      "The murder put the British government in a tough spot. Though it happened in Bombay, the investigation clearly showed the plot was planned in Indore, which had strong ties to the British.",
      "Terming it \"the most awkward affair\" for the British government, The New Statesman wrote that if it were a minor state, \"there would be no particular cause for anxiety\".",
      "\"But Indore has been a powerful feudatory of the Raj,\" it said.",
      "The British government initially tried to keep mum about the murder's Indore connection in public. But in private, it discussed the issue with much alarm, communication between the governments of Bombay and British India shows.",
      "Bombay police commissioner Patrick Kelly told the British government that all evidence \"points at present to a conspiracy hatched in Indore or by instigation from Indore to abduct Mumtaj [sic] through hired desperadoes\".",
      "The government faced pressure from different sides. Bawla's community of wealthy Memons, a Muslim community with roots in modern-day Gujarat, raised the issue with the government. His fellow municipal officials mourned his death, saying, \"there surely must be something more behind the scene\".",
      "Indian lawmakers demanded answers in the upper house of British India's legislature and the case was even discussed in the British House of Commons.",
      "Rohidas Narayan Dusar, a former police officer, writes in his book on the murder that the investigators were under pressure to go slow, but that then police commissioner Kelly threatened to resign.",
      "The case drew top lawyers for both the defence and the prosecution when it reached the Bombay High Court.",
      "One of them was Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would later become the founding father of Pakistan after India's partition in 1947. Jinnah defended Anandrao Gangaram Phanse, one of the accused and a top general with the Indore army. Jinnah managed to save his client from the death penalty.",
      "The court sentenced three men to death and three to life imprisonment, but it stopped short of holding the Maharaja accountable.",
      "Justice LC Crump, who led the trial, noted, however, that \"there were persons behind them [assailants] whom we cannot precisely indicate\".",
      "\"But where an attempt is made to kidnap a woman, who was for 10 years the mistress of the Maharaja of Indore, it is not in the least unreasonable to look to Indore as the quarter from which this attack may have emanated,\" the judge remarked.",
      "The case's prominence meant the British government had to act quickly against the Maharaja. They gave him a choice: face a commission of inquiry or abdicate, according to documents presented to parliament in India.",
      "The Maharaja chose to quit.",
      "\"I abdicate my throne in favour of my son on the understanding that no further inquiry into my alleged connection with the Malabar Hill Tragedy will be made,\" he wrote to the British government.",
      "After abdicating, the Maharaja stirred more controversy by insisting on marrying an American woman against the will of his family and community. Eventually, she converted to Hinduism and they wed, according to a British home department report.",
      "Meanwhile, Mumtaz Begum received offers from Hollywood and later moved to the US to try her luck there. She faded into obscurity after that."

      "In recent weeks, US President-elect Donald Trump has shown renewed interest in taking control of Greenland, a largely autonomous territory of Denmark in the Arctic and the world's largest island.",

      "Last month, Denmark announced a new $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) military package for the Arctic. It had been prepared before Trump's remarks but the announcement just hours after them was described by the Danish defence minister as an \"irony of fate\".",
      "\"What was important in what Trump said was that Denmark has to fulfil its obligations in the Arctic or it's got to let the US do it,\" says Elisabet Svane, chief political correspondent for Politiken newspaper.",
      "Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, believes that this is a case of Trump \"positioning himself before entering office\" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence.",
      "So even if Trump were to lose further interest in Greenland now, which Professor Jacobsen thinks is the most likely scenario, he has certainly put the spotlight on the issue.",
      "But independence for Greenland has been on the agenda for many years, and some say the debate could even go in the opposite direction.",
      "\"I noticed in the last few days the Greenland PM is calmer in his comments - ie. yes, we want independence but in the long run,\" says Svane.",
      "Greenland votes for independence, seeks closer ties with US",
      "There is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it.",
      "However, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system.",
      "\"The Greenland PM may be up in arms now, but in the event that he actually calls a referendum, he will need some kind of convincing narrative about how to save the Greenland economy and welfare system,\" Ulrik Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told the BBC.",
      "One possible next step is a free association - something like the US currently has with Pacific states the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.",
      "Denmark has previously opposed this status both for Greenland and for the Faroe Islands, but according to Dr Gad, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not categorically against it.",
      "\"Danish understanding of the Greenland historical experience is way better than it was 20 years ago,\" he says, with Denmark accepting colonial responsibility.",
      "The recent discussions \"might persuade [Frederiksen] to say - better to keep Denmark in the Arctic, keep some kind of connection to Greenland, even if it's a looser one\", he adds.",
      "But even if Greenland is able to get rid of Denmark, it has become clear in recent years that it can't get rid of the US. The Americans never really left after taking control of the island in World War Two, and see it as vital for their security.",
      "An agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted.",
      "Dr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role.",
      "\"They now know the US will never leave,\" he said.",
      "Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",
      "Danes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat",
      "Russia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland",
      "Trump steps up economic pressure",
      "There has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland.",
      "Professor Jacobsen says Danish governments have been preparing for that, and not just because of the Arctic territory.",
      "Trump has been threatening universal 10% tariffs on all US imports which could, among other things, significantly disrupt European growth, and some Danish and other European companies are now considering setting up manufacturing bases in the US.",
      "Possible options for raising tariffs include by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Benjamin Cote of international law firm Pillsbury told the website MarketWatch.",
      "One of the main Danish industries potentially affected by this is pharmaceuticals. The US receives products such as hearing aids and most of its insulin from Denmark, as well as the diabetes drug Ozempic, made by the Danish company Novo Nordisk.",
      "Analysts say the hike in prices that would result from these measures would not find favour with the US public.",
      "Trump invades Greenland",
      "The \"nuclear option\" seems far-fetched, but with Trump failing to rule out military action it has to be considered.",
      "Essentially, it wouldn't be hard for the US to take control, given that they already have bases and plenty of troops in Greenland.",
      "\"The US has de facto control already,\" says Professor Jacobsen, adding that Trump's remarks seemed ill-informed and he didn't understand the point of them.",
      "That said, any use of military force by Washington would create an international incident.",
      "\"If they invade Greenland, they invade Nato,\" says Svane. \"So that's where it stops. Article 5 would have to be triggered. And if a Nato country invades Nato then there's no Nato.\"",
      "Dr Gad says Trump sounds like Chinese President Xi Jinping talking about Taiwan or Russia's Vladimir Putin talking about Ukraine.",
      "\"He's saying it's legitimate for us to take this piece of land,\" he says. \"If we take him really seriously this is a bad omen for the whole of the Western alliance.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 01:12:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Meet the woman who has found an innovative way to simply accessing much-needed aid in war-torn Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "Last autumn Hania Zataari, a mechanical engineer who works for Lebanon's Ministry of Industry put her skills to use as war in the country raged on. Hailing from Sidon, South Lebanon, she created a chatbot on WhatsApp that simplified access to much-needed aid.",
      "\"They lost their houses, their savings, their work, everything they had built,\" Hania says, referring to those forced from their homes by war.",
      "On 23 September, Israel dramatically escalated its offensive against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, with which it had been fighting a spiralling conflict since Hezbollah attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "According to the Lebanese government, at least 492 people were killed in one of Lebanon's deadliest days of conflict in almost 20 years.",
      "Thousands of families fled to Sidon after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) hit what it said was 1,600 Hezbollah strongholds inside Lebanon.",
      "Hania says many displaced people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings, but many others who fled their homes were forced to rent elsewhere or stay with members of their family.",
      "It is these people who weren't directly receiving support from the government that she wanted to help. Drawing on her programming skills, Hania created the \"aidbot\" to narrow the gap between the demand and supply of aid.",
      "The aidbot is a chatbot - a type of AI system designed to communicate with its users online - that links to WhatsApp. It is programmed to ask simple questions about the types of aid people require along with their names and locations.",
      "This information is then recorded onto a Google spreadsheet which Hania and her team of unpaid volunteers, made up of friends and family, access to distribute aid such as food, blankets, mattresses, medicine and clothes.",
      "Hania used her spare time to build the bot using the website Callbell.eu, which is commonly used by businesses to engage with customers on Meta's platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook messenger.",
      "She explains that the bot, which is still being used today, makes distributing aid more efficient as it cuts down the amount of time she spends responding to requests for aid over WhatsApp.",
      "\"I'm not really interested in knowing their names. I just need to know where they are so I can manage the delivery,\" she says.",
      "Take, for example, a request for baby formula. Hania says the bot will ask for the age of the baby and the quantity needed so that she and her team can provide it.",
      "The project, she says, is funded by donations coming from Lebanese people living abroad. She's created a publicly available dashboard to record what the project has spent money on and how much aid she and her team have distributed.",
      "At the time of writing they have delivered 78 food parcels to families of 5 or 10 people, 900 mattresses, and 323 blankets across Sidon and other parts of Lebanon.",
      "Last October, 47 year-old Khaldoun Abbas and his family fled their homes in Najjarieh after they received calls from the IDF urging them to leave for their own safety.",
      "Seventeen people, ranging in age from nine to 78, slept under one roof in a rented three bed apartment in Sidon.",
      "Khaldoun says he, his wife and their children, as well as his brother's family slept on mattresses they requested using the aidbot in the hallway of the flat. They also requested blankets, food and cleaning detergents.",
      "Unlike his neighbours, he's not been able to return to his home. It was destroyed in a confirmed Israeli strike 11 days later. The IDF told the BBC it \"struck a terror infrastructure\".",
      "When we put this allegation to Khaldoun, he denied having any connection to Hezbollah or any other party.",
      "What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?",
      "Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Ceasefire in effect in Lebanon",
      "Lebanon's financial crisis explained",
      "\"This isn't the first time Sidon has opened its doors to displaced people,\" Hania explains, referring to the wave of people who have arrived in the city.",
      "Sidon has a long-standing reputation for taking in internally displaced people driven from their homes along the Lebanon-Israel border.",
      "The most recent conflict began in October 2023 after the war between Israel and Hamas spilled over into Lebanon when Hezbollah, Hamas' ally, fired rockets into Israel in support of Gaza.",
      "The Lebanese healthy ministry says nearly 4,000 people have been killed and over a million have been displaced. The ministry does not say how many of these are civilians or combatants.",
      "In Israel around 60,000 people have been evacuated from Northern Israel and authorities say more than 80 soldiers and 47 civilians have been killed.",
      "Last November a ceasefire was agreed between Israel and Lebanon. Despite some skirmishes it has largely been upheld. But people on the ground say the provision of aid has not improved.",
      "International NGO Islamic Relief told the BBC that the \"conflict, destruction, and evacuation orders have fuelled ongoing displacement in Lebanon which has made it difficult to assess and address the needs of the population amid the changing situation.\"",
      "But it is not just the war that is hindering aid distribution.",
      "Bilal Merie, a volunteer working with Hania says many of the problems they face are due to the \"high demand but short supply\" of aid.",
      "He puts it down to the deep economic turmoil that has gripped the country since 2019, meaning the Lebanese government has had to rely heavily on funding from creditors and aid organisations for goods.",
      "But even NGOs are feeling the crunch. Unicef Lebanon says that with only 20% of the funding they need, it \"continues to face an enormous funding gap,\" meaning the charity is unable to support families when they need it most.",
      "In a country overrun with financial woes and by war, could this aidbot make a tangible difference?",
      "It is the first time researcher John Bryant from the think tank Overseas Development Institute has heard of a chatbot being used in such a way in the humanitarian sector.",
      "He says the cultural context in which it is being used is commendable. That is, with knowledge of \"the channels people are using to talk to each other and meeting them in their own language\".",
      "However he is unsure of its scalability, as what works in Lebanon cannot easily be replicated in other parts of the world.",
      "\"What tech offers a lot of the time is a standard cookie cutter approach.",
      "\"It's the local designers, the local translators, the trusted human interlocutors and elements within that system that elevate digital tools into something useful,\" he says.",
      "The aidbot might not be able to offer the solution to all Lebanon's problems, but to the families using it, it has made life a little easier.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 03:03:06 GMT",
    "summary": "India\u2019s six losses in eight Tests raise doubts over Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, and their red-ball future.",
    "story": [
      "Indian cricket fans are still reeling from the team's crushing 1-3 defeat in the five-match Test series against Australia.",
      "Once dominant in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with historic victories over the mighty Australians over the past decade, the tourists fell short, exposing vulnerabilities in a side long thought invincible.",
      "The series highlighted glaring issues - Indian batters struggled, and Jasprit Bumrah was the lone bowler to trouble Australia.",
      "The loss not only cost India the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also denied them a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final, breaking their streak of back-to-back appearances in 2021 and 2023, where they lost to New Zealand and Australia respectively.",
      "India's recent form is troubling - they have lost six of their last eight Tests, including a shocking 0-3 home whitewash against New Zealand.",
      "The defeats have raised questions about the team's depth, the future of key players like captain Rohit Sharma and former skipper Virat Kohli, and their ability to rebuild.",
      "With a team in transition and stalwarts fading, Indian Test cricket faces pressing challenges to sustain its legacy in a rapidly evolving landscape.",
      "India's next red-ball challenge is a five-Test series in England starting July. England's conditions, known for dramatic shifts even within a session, will test players' technique, skills and adaptability to the limit.",
      "India hasn't won a series in England since 2007, with only two prior victories (1971, 1986), highlighting the daunting task ahead. Adding to the pressure, recent failures against New Zealand and Australia leave selectors grappling with tough decisions on player selection and team combinations for this critical campaign.",
      "The biggest headache for selectors is the form of batting stalwarts Sharma and Kohli after dismal outings in Australia and earlier against New Zealand.",
      "Sharma managed just 31 runs in three Tests in Australia, with his poor form seeing him dropping himself for the final game. Kohli fared slightly better with 190 runs in nine innings, but 100 runs of his total came in one knock. His dismissals followed a pattern - caught in the slips or behind the stumps - pointing to a glaring technical flaw or mental fatigue under pressure.",
      "Since January 2024, Sharma has managed just 619 runs in 16 Tests with one century. Kohli's numbers are worse over time - averaging 32 in Tests since 2020 with only two centuries.",
      "Once a late-blooming Test opener and blazing match-winner, Sharma now struggles to find his ideal batting position. Meanwhile, Kohli's surreal decline - after a decade of dominance and swagger- has left cricket's former titan in an extended slump.",
      "From Sunil Gavaskar to Sachin Tendulkar to Kohli, the baton of Indian batting greatness has passed seamlessly. But a worthy successor to Kohli remains elusive.",
      "KL Rahul has the class but lacks the hunger for consistent big scores. Rishabh Pant is a thrilling maverick, equally capable of winning or losing a match. Shubman Gill, touted as the next Big Thing, has struggled overseas despite his undeniable pedigree and needs careful nurturing.",
      "Punjab's young left-hander Abhishek Sharma, mentored by Yuvraj Singh, is highly rated, while Nitish Kumar Reddy impressed on debut in Australia with his fearless performances in tough situations.",
      "Yashasvi Jaiswal, India's top Test run-scorer in Australia this series, has been the standout among young batsmen. With panache, patience, technical assurance, and explosive strokes, he looks poised to become Kohli's successor as the team's talisman.",
      "India's talent pool is brimming across departments. Jasprit Bumrah, with his 32-wicket haul against Australia, has cemented his status as a fast-bowling colossus. Backed by Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, and a dozen promising quicks, India boasts a formidable pace arsenal for all formats.",
      "That said, Bumrah is a once-in-a-generation talent and needs careful workload management. Overburdening him, as in the Australia series, risks breakdowns that could impede the attack. Shami, after lengthy stints in rehab, also requires careful handling. Together, they form one of modern cricket's most formidable pace pairs.",
      "With Ravichandran Ashwin's sudden retirement and Ravindra Jadeja's lukewarm showing in Australia, India's spin depth looks thin. However, Washington Sundar has shown promise on home pitches, while young spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Tanush Kotian, who joined the squad mid-series in Australia, are knocking on the doors of Test cricket.",
      "Smarting from recent losses to New Zealand and Australia, the Indian cricket board  is moving swiftly to usher in a transition. Selectors have been directed to shortlist potential Test players from the second round of the domestic Ranji Trophy, resuming 23 January.",
      "All players, including Sharma and Kohli, are likely to be asked to play domestic cricket - a move that could help them regain form.",
      "Managing a team in transition poses complex challenges requiring patience, empathy, and clear vision. Knee-jerk reactions or external pressure could worsen the situation instead of providing solutions.",
      "Whether Sharma and Kohli can overcome their crisis remains to be seen, but India's wealth of talent should lift the current gloom surrounding Indian cricket.",
      "It's worth recalling that in 2011, after winning the ODI World Cup, India was whitewashed 4-0 in Test series against England and Australia. Cricket seemed to hit rock bottom.",
      "But, within months, a revival led by young talents like Kohli, Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Jadeja, Ashwin, and others saw India rise to become the world's top team across formats, holding that position for nearly a decade."

    "story": [
      "We may receive an affiliate commission from anything you buy from this article.",
      "Brooke Shields has written two New York Times bestsellers that recount a life lived in the public eye, and of the challenges faced in private, whether it be post-partum depression or the loss of her mother. In her latest, \"Brooke Shields is Not Allowed to Get Old: Thoughts on Aging as a Woman\"\u00a0(\u200eto be published January 14 by Flatiron Books), the model, actress and entrepreneur writes about the wrinkles that come with society's expectations of women as they reach or surpass \"a certain age.\"",
      "Shields, who will turn 60 in May, says that external perceptions don't match up with her internal sense of self, and that later years are something \"to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive.\" She also notes how society's ignorance of the power (not to mention the purchasing power) of women middle-aged and older is short-sighted at best.",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 21:59:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",

      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",
      "Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

    "summary": "Court to hear arguments Friday on law forcing TikTok sale by Chinese parent company that takes effect in Jan. 19.",
    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

      "Munn credited the risk assessment test, which uses various factors to evaluate lifetime breast cancer risk, for her early diagnosis. After hearing Munn's story, Hall decided to take the same test. To her surprise, a doctor revealed that Hall's lifetime risk for breast cancer was 36%.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 19:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",
      "Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"",
      "Later songs include the civil rights anthem \"No Easy Walk to Freedom,\" co-written with Margery Tabankin, and \"Light One Candle,\" calling for peace in Lebanon.",
      "Yarrow, who with Travers and Stookey had supported Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential bid, met the Minnesota senator's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, at a campaign event. The couple married the following year. They had two children before divorcing.",
      "In addition to his ex-wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.",

      "Pereyra was an employee at the Casa Sur Hotel in the Argentine capital where the former One Direction singer died last October.",
      "Last week, police arrested 24-year-old hotel waiter Braian Paiz \u2014 accused with Pereyra of having provided drugs to Payne. Paiz's lawyer confirmed to CBS News that he had been detained. Toxicology tests after Payne's death found he had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\" in his body.",
      "A total of five people are charged in the pop singer's death. Three of them \u2014 Payne's representative in Argentina, the manager of the hotel and the head of reception \u2014 are charged with manslaughter in the case.",
      "Prosecutors said last month\u00a0that the hotel manager and hotel reception manager allowed Payne to be taken up to his room, which had a balcony, instead of keeping him in a place without sources of danger, and with company, until medical help could arrive.",
      "Hotel workers called the police on the day\u00a0to report an \"aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,\" a spokesperson for the Buenos Aires Police said in a statement to CBS News back on Oct. 16, the day of Payne's death.",
      "Payne had spoken publicly about struggling with substance abuse and coping with achieving fame at an early age.",
      "His death prompted a global outpouring of grief from family, former bandmates and fans, with gatherings of thousands of mourners around the world.",
      "One of the highest-grossing live acts in the world in the 2010s, One Direction went on an indefinite hiatus in 2016. Payne enjoyed some solo success before his career stalled.",

      "Cohen, an Emmy Award-winning journalist who built his career as a producer at both CBS News and CNN, had lived for more than 50 years prior to his death with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. He and Vieira were married for 38 years and share three children: Benjamin Cohen, 36, Gabriel Cohen, 34, and Lily Cohen, 32.",
      "\"Today\" co-anchors Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie announced Cohen's death during Tuesday morning's episode of the NBC series. Kotb said Cohen was \"surrounded by his family and love\" when he died.",

      "Guthrie said Vieira \"was in really good spirits,\" adding that the family recently welcomed a new grandchild.",

Vieira's husband was vocal about his multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including in one interview with his wife on \"Today\" in 2018, which appeared in the segment.",
      "\"I was diagnosed when I was 25 years old and essentially told there is no hope,\" said Cohen in that 2018 interview. \"Diagnosed and adios. Nothing much we can do.\"",
      "Sharing his health journey and speaking up for others became intertwined with Cohen's work, as his illness was a focal point of his 2004 autobiography, \"Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness: A Reluctant Memoir,\" as well as his later writing. Cohen also survived two bouts of cancer.",

      "Multiple sclerosis, often abbreviated M.S., is a chronic autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks itself. It targets the central nervous system and can affect the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, according\u00a0to the the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Symptoms of the illness can vary in type and severity, but, as M.S. disrupts communication between the brain and body, it can cause problems like fatigue, memory loss, mood changes, mobility issues and impaired vision. Cohen was legally blind.",
      "What causes M.S. is unknown, and why the disease manifests in some people and not others isn't clear. According to the Mayo Clinic, it's thought that genetics and environmental factors may increase an individual's risk of developing the illness.",
      "It is incurable, but there are treatments. The disease is rarely fatal, and most people diagnosed with it have a normal life expectancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",

    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials turned up dozens of violations at a McDonald's supplier linked to a deadly outbreak of E. coli that led to more than a hundred infections and a sweeping recall of onions used in the fast food chain's products, including its Quarter Pounder burgers.",
      "The violations, detailed in an inspection report released to CBS News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, were seen during an inspection of a food production facility in Colorado run by Taylor Farms.",
      "Their findings amounted to the FDA issuing the McDonald's supplier a so-called Form 483, a list of citations over conditions inspectors worried could be \"injurious to health.\"",
      "That facility had been tasked with supplying \"slivered onions\" to McDonald's restaurants across a broad swath of states. Taylor Farms also produces a number of other products, including salads it sells in grocery stores as safe and ready to eat.",
      "For restaurants, Taylor Farms\u00a0bills its products\u00a0as a \"prep-less kitchen solution,\" allowing food service workers to skip the usual preparation steps they would need to use with ordinary produce that should be washed and cut before eating.",
      "\"We hold our suppliers to the highest expectations and standards of food safety. Prior to this inspection, and unrelated to its findings, McDonald's stopped sourcing from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility,\" McDonald's said in a statement.",
      "The company pointed to its October announcement\u00a0following the outbreak that it would stop buying onions from Taylor Farms in Colorado \"indefinitely,\" switching suppliers for some 900 restaurants that had relied on the plant.",
      "\"Taylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities,\" Taylor Farms said in a statement.",
      "The company \"immediately took steps to address\" the issues, the statement said, and added that the FDA classified\u00a0the inspection as not resulting in \"administrative or regulatory action\" against the company.",

      "The FDA said that Taylor Farms quality control officials had signed off on cleaning at the facility as passing, even when agency inspectors said they could still see \"several food contact surfaces that were not visually clean and should have been marked as a 'Fail'.\"",
      "Food debris building up on the company's equipment was so bad that it was leading to cross-contamination, the FDA's inspectors worried. A company that had been buying green peppers from Taylor Farms complained that onions had found their way into their ready-to-eat product.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",

      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 09:35:36 -0500",
    "summary": "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu in the first death in the U.S. caused by the H5N1 virus.",
    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",
      "The hospitalized child in Canada initially had conjunctivitis and fever before later developing cough, vomiting and diarrhea. She was later intubated after respiratory failure.",

      "India's federal government asked states on Monday to step up surveillance of respiratory illnesses and spread awareness about how to prevent the transmission of HMPV. Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.",

Nadda said Monday. \"The health systems and surveillance networks of the country are vigilant and there is no reason to worry.\"",
      "Nadda said the people infected in India had no recent travel history and that the government was \"closely monitoring the situation in China and neighboring countries.\"",

    "summary": "The first congestion pricing plan in the U.S. has begun, charging most drivers $9 a day to enter the lower half of Manhattan. The long-debated plan is projected to raise up to $800 million a year for the city's aging public transit system. Will it work?",
    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",
      "Fourteen hundred cameras keep tabs on the roughly 150,000 commuters entering the zone by car.",
      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",
      "New Jersey drivers were none too happy; they already pay more than $15 in bridge and tunnel tolls to get into the city.",

      "\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",
      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

    "title": "Before the Palisades Fire, many of those homeowners had lost insurance",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 18:14:17 -0500",
    "summary": "About 1,600 policies for Pacific Palisades homeowners were dropped by State Farm in July, the state insurance office says.",
    "story": [
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California whose district includes parts of Los Angeles, told CBS MoneyWatch she will soon re-introduce a bill called the Wildfire Insurance Coverage Study Act, which would require the Government Accountability Office to analyze the dangers posed by wildfires to communities, and how insurance companies are responding.",
      "\"It will help us determine what the best federal response is to these issues,\" Waters said. \"We have to know more about climate change,\" such as determining which areas or types of vegetation are more susceptible to wildfires, and the risk of building in those areas.",
      "She added that the higher risks are \"leaving homeowners and business owners and families without insurance coverage because some of the insurance companies are canceling; they are aren't writing any new insurance. People continue to pay higher prices for even less coverage.\"",
      "With the fires continuing to rage across the Los Angeles area, the estimated cost of the disaster is surging. The potential property damage and economic losses could amount to as much as $150 billion, according to a Thursday estimate from AccuWeather. That would make these wildfires by far the most destructive in U.S. history.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "The army of firefighters battling the massive\u00a0Southern California wildfires includes workers who could otherwise remain safely behind bars.",
      "As of Friday, 939 prison inmates have been deployed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to help contain the blazes, the department confirmed to CBS News. The crews of incarcerated firefighters are embedded with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) to assist its nearly 4,700 firefighters.",
      "The imprisoned firefighters volunteer to participate in CDCR's Conservation (Fire) Camps Program and are paid for their work. Participants supports state, local and federal government agencies when they respond to natural disasters. Specifically, they are removing vegetation to cut fire lines and taking away fuel from behind structures to slow the blaze. Inmates can also serve in support roles at the camps, including cooking, laundry and water treatment plant operation.",

      "CDCR operates 35 so-called fire camps across 25 different California counties, employing approximately 1,870 incarcerated people. Two of the camps are for incarcerated women. They are minimum-security facilities staffed with correctional personnel who supervise camp participants 24 hours per day.",
      "Participation in the camps is voluntary, and those who join in must be deemed physically and mentally fit. Additionally, they must have no more than eight years remaining on their sentences. Convictions for rape and other sex offenses, as well as for murder, arson and some other serious crimes, disqualifies an inmate from participating.",
      "How much do incarcerated firefighters earn?",
      "Imprisoned firefighters' pay depends on their skill level. They earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to CDCR, which pays their wages. Wage levels doubled in 2023, up from between $2.90 and $5.12 per day.",
      "Inmates in the program also earn supplemental pay while responding to emergencies. Cal Fire pays an additional $1 an hour, regardless of firefighters' skill level. And when crews work a 24-hour shift, followed by a 24-hour period of rest, the lowest-skilled firefighter would earn $26.90 in a day.",
      "Additionally, camp participants earn time credits toward their sentences. Specifically, most earn two additional days off their sentences for every day served on a fire crew.",
      "Camp participants are eligible for employment with Cal Fire once they have served their sentences, a path many choose to take, according to CDCR. The department says some of these individuals have successfully transitioned to roles with Cal Fire, the U.S. Forest Service, and interagency hotshot crews.",
      "As of Friday, the\u00a0fires\u00a0had scorched more than 55 square miles across the Los Angeles area. At least 10 people are dead, and more than 300,000 Los Angelenos were under evacuation orders, according to officials.",

    "summary": "Meta shocked the tech world this week by moving to overhaul its approach to fact checking. Here's what the changes mean for social media users.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",

      "Employers added 256,000 jobs in December, blowing past economists' expectations and signaling that the job market remains resilient in the face of still-high borrowing rates and stickier-than-expected inflation.",
      "The economy was expected to add 153,000 jobs last month, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. The unemployment rate in December stepped down to 4.1%, lower than the forecast that the rate would remain steady at 4.2%.",
      "Hiring was strongest in the health care, government and social assistance industries, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. Retail companies also added jobs last month, after a decline in November.",
      "The Jan. 10 jobs report marks the last monthly employment snapshot of the Biden administration, which inherited an economy scarred by the pandemic. When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the jobless rate stood at 6.4%, while inflation was about to soar to 40-year highs, kicking off a flurry of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to tame price increases.",
      "Under the Fed's restrictive monetary policy, the economy has cooled, dampening inflation but also creating some cracks in the labor market. At the same time, the incoming Trump administration's policies, if enacted, are expected to be inflationary, prompting some economists to predict that the central bank may hold off on cutting rates at its January 29 meeting.",
      "Fewer Fed cuts?",
      "The robust jobs report may also ease pressure on the Fed to continue to cut rates, given the Fed Chair Jerome Powell had cited some earlier signs of weakness in the labor market as one reason why the central bank began cutting rates in September.",
      "\"The solid December employment report will solidify the Fed's intentions to proceed with the slower pace of interest rate cuts it signaled at its December meeting,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Officials have been a bit disappointed at the uneven pace of progress in lowering inflation, and the data should ease any fears that keeping rates on hold will pose a significant risk to the labor market.\"",
      "The Fed in December trimmed its benchmark for a third straight month amid signs that the economy was gearing down. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

    "story": [
      "As deadly\u00a0wildfires engulf swaths\u00a0of Los Angeles County, forcing nearly 200,000 people from their houses, a still-to-be known number of residents will be contending with insurance claims to recoup losses and rebuild or repair their homes. For those looking to be treated fairly and paid for damage and destruction to their property, speaking up and doing advance research is crucial, experts and consumer advocates say.",
      "The good news? Unlike with\u00a0flooding, a standard homeowners' policy covers destruction and damage caused by fire, including wildfires, and a\u00a0standard renters' insurance policy covers the renter's personal belongings, according to the Insurance Information Institute.",
      "The optional comprehensive part of a standard auto insurance policy covers vehicles against damage caused by fire and falling objects. Approximately 75% of U.S. drivers opt to buy it.",
      "\"California property insurers are acting as financial first responders to help their impacted customers recover from the Los Angeles fires,\" the institute stated on Thursday. \"This includes providing immediate relief through additional living expenses coverage (ALE) for displaced policyholders. Losses to property and vehicles will be covered up to the limits contained with an insurance policy.\"",
      "Property insurers are required to immediately pay policyholders a minimum of one-third of the estimated value of their personal belongings and a minimum of four months' worth of rent for the local area in which they live, it stated, citing state regulations.",
      "When and how to file a claim",
      "Triple-I advises the following\u00a0steps to begin filing a claim:",
      "Contact your insurance carrier or agent as soon as possible to begin the claim-filing process, and make sure to ask about requirements and deadlines. Many insurers have a mobile app where you can file a claim.",
      "Take photos of damaged items (if it is safe to do so) and don't discard damaged items until your assigned insurance adjuster has completed their assessment.",
      "Keep all receipts for out-of-pocket expenses, such as temporary lodging.",
      "Things to know and watch out for",
      "Many property owners hit with large and total losses learn the hard way that they are not fully insured. The issue is so common that United Policyholders has an entire section on its website devoted to underinsurance help. \"Many property owners have succeeded in getting the coverage they thought they had but didn't, but many have given up. Insurers count on you giving up,\" according to the nonprofit organization that advocates for policyholders of all types.",
      "Fires that damage but don't completely destroy one's home create their own insurance claim issues, according to United Policyholders. Things to watch out for include hidden damage from water, smoke, ash and mold. Air quality and ducts should also be considered. \"Repairs should return your property to a 'uniform and consistent appearance' even if that means replacing undamaged items such as roof tiles or carpeting,\" it stated.",
      "People living in seemingly unscathed residences alongside homes that burned down should still have their place inspected for possible structural and other damage from extreme heat, smoke or fire retardant. \"If your insurer refuses to conduct or pay for proper inspections, ask again in writing; politely remind them of their legal duty to thoroughly investigate all damage, including hidden damage. If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away. Coverage for landscaping replacement is typically a set amount or percentage of your dwelling coverage. The losses are frequently only partially covered. \"Mature trees can be valued as high as $5,000 yet many policies contact a $500 per tree limit.\"",
      "Another thing to keep in mind: Unreimbursed losses can offset your tax obligations when you claim as a casualty loss deduction.",
      "If one believes they are being treated poorly by their insurance company, the California Department of Insurance has an online\u00a0form that homeowners can use to file complaints.",
      "Steps in preparing to evacuate",
      "For those told to evacuate due to the wildfires, do so immediately. For those preparing to evacuate, here are some tips from United Policyholders:",
      "1. Document your home and possessions. Take pictures or a video of each room and the outside of your house. Build as much of an inventory as time permits including furnishings, artwork, jewelry and appliances. \"After a traumatic loss, it's impossible to remember everything you had, so most people never collect their full insurance benefits,\" United Policyholders noted.",
      "2. Pack important documents:",

      "3. Start savings receipts. Wildfire evacuees can file for reimbursement for additional living expenses. Check the \"loss of use\" section of your policy. If your home is not damaged and your temporary living expenses are modest, keep in mind that filing a claim goes on your record and can hike your insurance costs.",

      "Another possible U.S. port strike is looming later this month, which may seem like deja vu given it's only been three months since a\u00a0work stoppage\u00a0stemming from a labor dispute closed every major East and Gulf Coast port in October.",
      "While that strike ended after three days with a tentative deal between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) that addressed some key issues, the sides face a January 15 deadline to resolve other concerns.",
      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines. Other technologies put to use at\u00a0automated ports\u00a0include AI-powered sensors, so-called digital twins \u2014 or identical, digital\u00a0replicas\u00a0of ports \u2014 and blockchain to automate the recording of transactions and track container locations.",
      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:04:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of taxpayers continue to struggle with delays in refunds from the IRS, a new tax advocate report says.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans continue to grapple with IRS delays that are preventing them from getting their tax refunds in a timely manner, according to a new report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent watchdog that's part of the IRS.",
      "The report, published annually to highlight the IRS' most glaring problems, comes after the agency was given billions in new funding through the Inflation Reduction Act to improve its technology and go after wealthy tax cheats. Yet for many taxpayers, dealing with the IRS involves \"delays, frustration and unnecessary costs,\" the taxpayer advocate, Erin M. Collins, wrote in the report.",
      "Problems highlighted in the report echo issues that bedeviled millions of taxpayers during the pandemic, when the IRS shuttered its offices, causing many returns to get caught in a bottleneck, delaying refunds. While the worst of those issues have since been resolved, Collins noted, the IRS continues to struggle in some areas, such as processing paper returns and dealing with taxpayers who have been victims of identity theft, which can lead to lengthy refund delays.",
      "\"Notwithstanding the improvements I have described, taxpayers continue to face challenges in their dealings with the IRS,\" she wrote.",
      "The nearly $80 billion in funding from the IRA has helped the tax agency hire more workers, some of whom have bulked up its customer service support. But almost $6 out of every $10 of the new funding is directed toward enforcement, or boosting audits of wealthy tax cheats and businesses that skirt tax laws, the report noted.",
      "\"I have previously criticized this extreme imbalance in funding priorities,\" Collins wrote in the report, noting that she believes more money should be directed toward taxpayer services, an IRS unit that helps taxpayers with questions, problems and other dilemmas that arise.",
      "The IRS has already made improvements in some of the areas underscored by Collins, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The NTA report also acknowledges the progress the IRS has made, which Werfel said demonstrates \"what a well-funded IRS can do.\"",
      "\"It's important to continue that momentum because we recognize the agency's work isn't done \u2014not by a long shot,\" he said. \"It's vital that the IRS continue this progress to better serve taxpayers and the nation.\"",
      "Here's who is facing tax refund delays",
      "Collins reiterated one of her earlier\u00a0criticisms\u00a0of the IRS: That paper returns are the agency's \"kryptonite.\" Unfortunately, she said in her most recent return, the IRS continues to receive more than 10 million income tax returns on paper each year \u2014 while it also gets another 75 million paper forms from taxpayers.",
      "While the IRS has made progress in processing paper returns, it's still not up to snuff, she noted. Processing paper returns can still take months for the IRS to complete, she added.",
      "And many people who e-file also face delays if their 1040s are rejected, an issue that impacted 18 million taxpayers in fiscal year 2024, or 12% percent of returns, her report noted. These rejections can happen for issues like a PIN that doesn't match the prior year's return, or an adjusted gross income number that doesn't match up from the prior year.",
      "\"[M]ost rejected returns are valid, requiring taxpayers to jump through additional hoops to resubmit their returns electronically or submit the returns on paper,\" she wrote. \"Most taxpayers receive refunds, and delays in processing both paper-filed and e-filed returns translate into refund delays.\"",
      "People who have been victims of identity theft are another group that often face delays in getting resolution. About half a million taxpayers are still trying to their their issues fixed, although it took the IRS about 22 months on average to resolve the cases and send refunds to the victims, she added.",
      "That can be stressful for taxpayers waiting for their refunds, but it also creates an additional cost to the federal government, which must pay interest on overpayments it doesn't refund on a timely basis, the report pointed out.",
      "Some businesses, meanwhile, are facing delays due to the Employee Retention Credit, a tax benefit created in the pandemic to help businesses stay afloat. But the IRS has\u00a0flagged the ERC as vulnerable to fraud, leading to delays in processing returns.",
      "The IRS is \"still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024\" for returns that claimed the Employee Retention Credit, the report said. \"Although its aim was to minimize the payment of ineligible claims, there have been lengthy delays in the payment of eligible claims submitted by employers that, in some cases, are depending on ERC refunds to remain in business.\"",
      "When does tax filing open in 2025?",
      "Tax filing typically begins at the end of January, although the IRS hasn't yet announced when it will start accepting all returns.",
      "Some taxpayers can start filing on Jan. 10, however, the IRS said on Tuesday. That's because its Free File service will start accepting returns on Friday, it noted.",
      "The IRS Free File program, which is offered through tax software companies, is available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.",
      "It's a different service than the IRS' relatively new Direct File service, which will be available in more than 20 states this tax season, from Alaska to Wyoming.",

      "When Mr. Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for a change with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",

      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",

      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",

    "summary": "Republicans in Washington are working on plans to shrink Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that covers 1 in 5 Americans.",
    "story": [
      "Under President Biden, enrollment in Medicaid hit a record high and the uninsured rate reached a record low.",
      "Donald Trump's return\u00a0to the White House \u2014 along with a GOP-controlled Senate and House of Representatives \u2014 is expected to change that.",
      "Republicans in Washington say they plan to use funding cuts and regulatory changes to dramatically shrink Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that, along with the related Children's Health Insurance Program, serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The proposals include rolling back the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid, which over the last 11 years added about 20 million low-income adults to its rolls. Trump has said he wants to drastically cut government spending, which may be necessary for Republicans to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of this year.",
      "Trump made little mention of Medicaid during the 2024 campaign. The first Trump administration approved work requirements in several states, though only Arkansas implemented theirs before a federal judge said it violated the law. The first Trump administration also sought to block grant funding to states.",
      "House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, told KFF Health News that Medicaid and other federal entitlement programs need major changes to help cut the federal debt. \"Without them, we will watch this country sadly enter into fiscal collapse.\"",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the Budget Committee, said Congress needs to explore cutting federal spending on Medicaid.",
      "\"You need wholesale reform on the health care front, which can include undoing a lot of the damage being done by the ACA and Obamacare,\" Roy said. \"Frankly, we could end up providing better service if we do it the right way.\"",
      "Advocates for poor people fear GOP funding cuts will leave more Americans without insurance, making it harder for them to get care.",
      "\"Medicaid is an obvious target for huge cuts,\" said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"An existential fight about Medicaid's future likely lies ahead.\"",
      "Medicaid, which turns 60 in July, is nearing the end of a disruptive period, after COVID pandemic-era coverage protections expired in 2023 and all enrollees had to prove they still qualified. More than 25 million people lost coverage over the 18 months after the \"unwinding\" began, though it has not notably increased the number of people without insurance, according to the latest census data.",
      "The unwinding's disruptions could pale in comparison to what happens in the next four years, said Matt Salo, former executive director and founder of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \"What we are going to see is an even bigger seismic shift in who Medicaid covers and how it operates,\" he said.",
      "But Salo said any efforts to shrink the program will face pushback.",
      "\"A lot of powerful entities \u2014 state governments, managed-care organizations, long-term care providers, and everyone under the sun who wants to do well by doing good \u2014 wants to see Medicaid work efficiently and be adequately funded,\" he said. \"And they will be highly motivated to push back on something they see as draconian cuts, because it could affect their business model.\"",
      "The GOP is looking at several tactics to reduce the size of Medicaid:",
      "Shifting to block grants. Switching to annual block grants could lower federal funding for states to operate the program while giving states more discretion over how to spend the money. Currently, the government matches a certain percentage of state spending each year with no cap. Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan have sought to block-grant Medicaid with no success. Arrington said he favors ending the open-ended federal funding to states and replacing it with a set annual amount based on how many people each state has in the program.Cutting ACA Medicaid funding. The ACA provided financing to cover, through Medicaid, Americans with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $20,783 for an individual last year. The federal government pays 90% of the cost for adults covered through the law's Medicaid expansion, which 40 states and Washington, D.C., have adopted. The GOP may try to lower that funding to the same match rate the feds pay states for everyone else in the program, which averages about 60%. \"We should absolutely note that we are subsidizing the healthy, able-bodied Medicaid expansion population at a higher rate than we do the poorest and sickest among us, which was the original intent of the program,\" Arrington said. \"That's not right.\"Lowering federal matching funds. Since Medicaid began, the federal match rate has been based on the relative wealth of a state's population, with poorer states receiving a higher rate and no state receiving less than a 50% match. Ten states get the base rate \u2014 all but two are Democratic-run states, including New York and California. The GOP may seek to cut the base rate to 40% or less.Adding work requirements. During the first Trump term, federal courts ruled that Medicaid law doesn't allow coverage to be conditioned on enrollees' working or seeking jobs. But the GOP may try again. \"If we can get strict work requirements on able-bodied adults, that can be a huge cost savings by itself,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, told KFF Health News. Because most Medicaid enrollees already work, go to school or serve as caregivers, critics say such a requirement would simply add red tape to obtaining coverage, with little impact on employment.Placing enrollment hurdles. About 10 states offer some populations what's called continuous eligibility, whereby people stay enrolled for years without having to renew their coverage. That policy's been shown to prevent enrollees from falling out of the program for short periods because of hardships or paperwork problems, which can lead to surprise medical bills and debt. The Trump administration could seek to repeal waivers that allow states to grant multiyear continuous eligibility, which would require people in those states to reapply for coverage annually.",

      "Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said he hopes the Trump administration holds states accountable for overpaying providers and enrolling people in Medicaid who are not eligible. Conservatives have cited CMS reports saying states improperly pay Medicaid providers billions of dollars a year, though the federal government notes that is mostly due to lack of documentation.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Naples, Florida and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has a new documentary airing on PBS, \"Coming to America.\" It examines how nine remarkable American immigrants have shaped our country's history. Welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "FORMER SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this documentary, you tell the stories of these individuals who immigrated to the US, and they were very successful, people like Albert Einstein. You know, when you look at Einstein and you look at Henry Kissinger, they were refugees to this country. Donald Trump set refugee admissions at very low levels first term. He's talking about blocking refugee admissions this term. Is that a mistake?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I think, I think we're going through a period of, frankly, reacting to an extraordinarily disastrous immigration policy. So you're going to have some twists and turns. In the long run, we do want to have an ability to allow legitimate refugees to come here. We also, and part of the reason Calista and I made this documentary for PBS, is- we really believe strongly that legal immigrants are a major contribution to America's success and to its exceptional nature. And we want to make sure that, you know, as many Americans favor legal immigration as opposed to illegal immigration\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right.",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: It's very important to distinguish the two, and we want to strongly communicate that legal immigration in a variety of forms, refugees is one, and another is various work permits. But we want people to be able to come to America if they do so legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said immigrants inhabit the very soul of what it is to be an American. When you say legitimate refugees, what do you mean?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I think people can- can stand up and say, I've now decided I'm a refugee. I feel threatened. The question is, is that true or not? Are they really threatened\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Claim asylum, you mean?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: \u2013or is that just their way of getting into the United States? To claim asylum, I think there's a big- there's a big difference between somebody who genuinely faces a potential loss of life or freedom and somebody who simply wants to come to America and decides to claim that status",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic migrants, there. Let me ask you, someone else you feature in here, Zalmay Khalilzad. Very prominent Afghan American who brokered Trump's deal with the Taliban to exit Afghanistan. As you know, with that chaotic exit, there were tens of thousands of Afghans scattered, some of them still separated from their families. Many of them worked for the U.S. government. Should Mr. Trump extend the legal process of this program and bring those Afghans here, and would you ask Congress to raise the current cap they have on the number of them coming?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: You know, I think the Afghan refugees who actively fought on the side of Americans, saved American lives, tried to help win against the Taliban- I think they deserve an unusual level of support and treatment. And I worked all during the period of President Biden's insanely disastrous withdrawal. I tried to work with various people and did podcasts with people who were trying to get folks out of Afghanistan who should legitimately have been helped by the U.S. government. So, when somebody is totally your ally- and this happened with the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese War, when somebody is totally your ally and they risk their lives side by side with you, you shouldn't abandon them. That's a pretty straightforward rule.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that Biden administration blamed the Trump administration for was the difficulty in making those fast arrangements to bring those Afghans here, and that's a story for another day, but the person they put their finger on as making it more difficult is Stephen Miller, who is now the top policy adviser to Mr. Trump. He did add new requirements to visas, other things that made it harder to legally come here. Have you spoken to him about some of your concerns?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: No, I know Stephen very well. Look, Stephen was responding to a disastrous level of immigration that's not sustainable. And I think that's- I think virtually every American agrees you can't have an open border. You can't have Venezuelan gangs, for example, or El Salvadorian gangs. I mean, there are a lot of good reasons, and you're going to get some overreaction, but it's an overreaction, frankly, caused by people like President Biden, who were totally irresponsible in allowing people into this country by the millions in a way that was totally illegal. It was outside the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay- Pardon me, I don't know if our viewers heard that there was an alarm that went off here, so it interrupted some of- of what you said there. Donald Trump has chosen your wife, Callista, who helped make this documentary with you, to be the next ambassador to Switzerland. Are you advising the President-elect in any capacity right now?",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, I chat with him, and I certainly chat with members of the team. I've had a long experience as a Republican activist\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Okay\u2013",
      "FORMER SPEAKER GINGRICH: \u2013On some things, like getting through the tax cut bill\u2013",

      "SEN. MARK KELLY: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It- it's going to be a very busy week in the Senate. Before I get to those confirmation hearings, I want to follow up on what the FBI director told our Scott Pelley there in describing some of the Chinese hacking and what incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz called \"cyber time bombs\" throughout U.S. infrastructure. What needs to happen? What do the consequences need to be for China, having done this and remaining in our infrastructure?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, we've got to be strong in standing up to them and- and ex- explaining to them, and in some cases, I think consequences need to be serious. There are things that we can do, we have the tools. But I would say, even beyond that, we've got to figure out a way to get them off of the infrastructure. With regards to the telecom system, multiple companies, you know, Chinese cyber software are currently on those systems, and we're working to try to fix this. Some of this is going to require that the- the telecom companies upgrade their infrastructure. That could be costly. We're currently working with them to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's pretty incredible that this espionage happened in the first place, and expelling them is so hard to do. I want to also ask you about another Chinese question, and that has to do with Tiktok, because the attorney for the company said they will go dark next Sunday, unless the Supreme Court intervenes and stops this national security law from taking effect, or delays it, as Mr. Trump has asked the court to do. What do you think is going to happen here?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, based on the oral argument in the case two days ago, it looks like the Supreme Court- I mean, I don't really want to speculate, but it- it does look like they're going to uphold the law that we passed. So- I think on the 19th, so one day before- before the inauguration, you know, Tiktok on our systems, on our servers, becomes something that's now been banned by Congress. So I imagine there's going to be a disruption in the service here, you know, starting on the 19th. I know this is controversial. I know there are folks out there that earn a living, you know, on Tiktok, but it has a national security risk to it. You know, one is the data, one of the risks. The thing that I'm more concerned about is their ability to manipulate the- the population of the United States, especially in time of a conflict. So it was the right decision. I voted for it. And it looks like the Supreme Court is going to uphold the legislation that we passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll track that story. I want to follow up on something Senator Barrasso brought up, which was the Laken Riley Act. You say you support this. It's a bill that would require federal authorities to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft related crimes, rather than releasing them on parole. This bill was introduced last congress, didn't go anywhere. Was it wrong for Democrats not to take it up? Was it election year politics that made Democrats concerned about bringing it forward?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, in the last year, we've been working with Republicans on bipartisan border security legislation with the hope of getting that passed and then moving on to comprehensive immigration reform. I think we could do that. I think there's a lot of, you know, there's- you know, there's an effort, I think, that's going to continue. You know, right now, this is certainly bipartisan. I voted for cloture on the, you know, motion to start talking about it. And ultimately I'll vote\u2014",

      "SEN: KELLY: Well\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014which was such a live issue during the campaign?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I mean, the Laken Riley Act is very specific. I mean, it does one specific thing. We were working on something that was much more comprehensive, money for Border Patrol agents, and hiring, and infrastructure, policy changes. And policy changes, you know, you really have to do in a bipartisan way. We can't do that through the reconciliation process you were talking about. So there is- you know, I think there's- there's going to be an effort ongoing. This is bipartisan. You're right, we didn't do this a year ago, you know, maybe we should have. But we were working on bipartisan border security legislation. We weren't able to get that across the finish line. I hope we can do that in this Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to two of the- two of the picks here. You sit on the Armed Services Committee. Typically, only the ranking and chairs of the committees get to see the FBI background check on a nominee. But as you know, many senators are asking for more information on Pete Hegseth, here. Do you have any information from the ranking member of the committee, from Senator Reed, that you will get access or get any information from that FBI background check?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Margaret, let me just start by saying, there is not a job that's more serious and more critical to our national security than Secretary of Defense, and we need a qualified individual in that job, and he just does not seem to have the qualifications. And then on top of that, you look at his personal conduct, especially when he was managing Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans of America. You know, these two organizations were financially- financially mismanaged. There was reports of being into- intoxicated on the job, and creating an environment, you know, where there was, you know, some issues with, you know, sexual harassment. So I think it's in the nominee, Mr. Hegseth's, best interest if he wants to be confirmed for this job, for us to have all the information. You know, the information from these organizations, but also the FBI background check. Right now, as you say, the chairman and the ranking member are going to get it. That's an agreement with the White House, but there has been exceptions made in the past for certain nominees. This, clearly, because it is bipartisan, like a bi- you know, across the aisle, folks want to see the FBI background check. I think we should get an opportunity to take a look at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, the New York Times is reporting that your- that the ranking member had been briefed as of Friday. Are- you're saying no information has been shared?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "SEN. KELLY: \u2014you know, we will have an opportunity, you know- I'll talk to the ranking member, and I also talked to the chairman about this, about his nomination in general. Moreso, the discussion I had with Roger Wicker was about just meeting with Mr. Hegseth. We've reached out to him multiple times. Have not been able to schedule a meeting in my office. And he's not meeting with any other Democrats on the committee other than the ranking member. More information is better. If- if he wants to be confirmed to this job, I think it's in our best interest to have everything put out on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Intelligence Committee. Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, she is controversial as well. Republican Senator Capito was on FOX today and said when she privately met with Tulsi Gabbard, she pressed her on that 2017 trip to Syria that came in the wake of a chemical weapons attack carried out by dictator Bashar Al-Assad against civilians. Gabbard told her, she said, that she didn't even know she was going to Syria, that she intended to go to Lebanon on the scheduled visit and ended up in Syria. Is that a credible answer?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I talked to Congresswoman Gabbard this week, met with her in my office. We talked about the trip to Syria. She didn't tell me that part. I mean, I think it's kind of unusual that you wind up in one place, it wasn't part of the plan. But what concerns me more, especially about that trip, is, it was common knowledge that Assad was gassing the civilian population, using chemical weapons against the population, multiple times. And she didn't argue about those, but she took the time and the effort to make a case that there were two cases, and she used, you know, experts that were not critical- credible to try to- try to prove that he was not using chemical weapons in those two instances. And I have a hard time understanding why you would want to do that, to use your political capital to try to prove something when there are multiple cases. And you know, on top of that, when you look at- you know, what's- what- in- in Russia with misinformation, she does seem to have a predilection for- for misinformation\u2014.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Sen. John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the number two Republican in the Senate, Wyoming's John Barrasso. He joins us this morning from Casper, Wyoming. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a busy week ahead in the Senate, but before I get to that business, I do want to ask you about these fires in California. Do you expect that Congress will have to provide an additional aid package, and if so, when?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: What we're seeing is heartbreaking, its horrible, affecting people, old and young, rich and poor. Everyone in the Wyoming National Guard is there on the scene, helping with manpower as well as equipment. When you see what's being shown on television, in addition to the tragedy on the ground, you're also seeing gross mismanagement in California by elected officials, and it's heartbreaking to hear the fire chief say that they've diverted all of this money away from the fire department to be used for social programs when they were already stretched too thin. So yes, I expect there's going to be hearings, there's going to be requests of Congress. There can't be a blank check on this, however, because people want to make sure that as rebuilding occurs, as things go on in California, they have to be resilient, so that these sorts of things can't happen again. And the policies of the liberal administration out there, I believe have made these fires worse.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect, though, that Congress and Republicans will still help these Americans in need, even if they don't like their local politics in the party?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: I expect that there will be strings attached to money that is ultimately approved, and it has to do with being ready the next time, because this was a gross failure this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, let me move on to what's happening this week. Because you are the whip. You are the vote counter. You are watching very closely what these hearings for these picks made by Donald Trump will be like. Starting Tuesday, 13 of the picks are going to be up for questioning. Leader Thune told us last Sunday, he suspects a lot we'll get through, but we'll see about all of them. Which nominees are you certain will be confirmed by January 20?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, let's start with- we were elected- Republicans are now in the House, the Senate and the White House, because Americans wanted safety and prosperity. So you're right, the rubber hits the road this week with all of these hearings on the cabinet, and then when President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders. A blizzard of executive orders on the economy, as well as on the border. So, when we met with President Trump, just- earlier this past week, what President Trump said the number one goal for the Senate needs to be to get his team in place. I've met with just about all of them. I support every one of these nominees. As the whip, my job is to make sure they get across the finish line. Get on the job, and President Trump deserves a team early. Chuck Schumer said he wants to make fireworks at the hearings. If that happens, we are going to work around the clock, through the night, through weekends to make sure we get that cabinet confirmed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about some of those picks on the other side of this commercial break, and how many of them will sail through since you do have the Republican majority and enough votes to do this without democratic help. We'll talk about those specifics in a moment. Stay with us through this break.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation now with Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso. Senator, you are the whip. You count the votes. Does Pete Hegseth, the pick to run the Pentagon, have them?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, he certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon. He knows about a fit, fighting force. He is very qualified, in my opinion. He has a record, a distinguished record, of service in the military. Every Senator gets to speak for themselves, and they will do that. The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential. People will listen and make their own decision. People have already had chances to ask questions, and they're going to continue to do so. I expect he's going to have quality answers to the questions that they ask.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who is a sexual assault survivor herself did say last month that she wanted the FBI to vet the claims against Mr. Hegseth that were made by an accuser who said that he raped her. He denies that that assault happened. He claims it was consensual sex, despite her filing of that police report. She also asked that the results be presented to the committee. Is that FBI vetting being shared with members of the Armed Services Committee?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Joni is a warrior. She is a patriot. I know she's had a chance to meet with the nominee at least twice, and advice and consent is about giving advice as well as asking consent. She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday and ultimately make her decision. With regard to the FBI report, reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already. Traditionally, those reports do not get shared with the other members of the committee. That goes back four decades, back when John McCain was chairman of the committee, and I support the chairman in that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's why it is so notable that such a prominent member and other senators are asking to see FBI vetting. Do you prefer that the details of that sexual assault be disclosed in a public hearing, or would you support that those private investigative details be shared with members at the discretion of the chairman?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, the chairman is going to make that decision, and I support the chairman. I also support Pete Hegseth. If you take a look at the current nominee, compared to who has been in the Pentagon the last four years, where they had a woke military, where recruitment went down, morale went down. I think Pete is going to be terrific in terms of recruitment, in terms of morale, in terms of returning America to a fighting force, which is what the American people really want. They want to make sure if our military is called upon. They are ready to go, that they are ready to fight, and that with intimidating power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Just to correct myself alleged sexual assault. So let me ask you about another nominee, or nominee to be one to run the intelligence community and oversee all the agencies. It appears the only member of Mr. Trump's national security team that doesn't have a real scheduled hearing is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it the FBI background check that's holding things up, or is it the ethics disclosure that's a problem?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: I support Tulsi Gabbard. She is amazing in that she has been a member of Congress and a combat veteran, a decorated combat veteran for work under fire in Iraq. You're right. It's a paperwork problem right now with the Office of Government Ethics. We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. It looks like it's going to be the following week, but she continues to have promotions in the military. She's a lieutenant colonel. She now has top level security clearances. She's the right person to keep America secure and safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She took the unusual measure of releasing a public statement reversing some past policy positions she'd taken when it came to surveillance. Are you concerned that you don't have enough Republicans who are willing to vote for her?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: I'm not concerned at all about that. Senator, Tom Cotton, who is chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has met with her on numerous occasions. She will have a hearing. She has to raise her right hand, take an oath at the time, she will be telling the truth. And the issue that you just raised, which is foreign surveillance, she is now in the mind and the position that is consistent with the chairman of the committee and Republican members of the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned shocking on day one of Mr. Trump's new term with executive orders. But some of this action is also going to require congressional help. This week, President Biden banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in 625 meters of the- of the ocean. Excuse me, miles. Are you going to reverse that in that first reconciliation bill that leader Thune told us about? Well,",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: Well, what President Biden just did by executive order, I expect that President Trump will eliminate with executive orders as well. In terms of the reconciliation bill, what we need: results. The results are what matter. We were sent here, and President Trump says he doesn't care if it's one bill, two bills, three bills. He wants the results as we are united, on securing the border, on bringing down costs for American citizens, across what- we want to make sure that tax cuts don't- don't expire. We want to make sure that the country is safe and strong. Those are the issues that the American people elected us to. That's what we're here to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up there. Mr. Trump has said one big, beautiful bill is what he wants. It seems procedural, but we know from- from the Senate side, you would prefer two different reconciliation bills at two different times to tackle some of these big agenda items. When you hear that the Speaker of the House says it's got to be one because he can only get one thing through, doesn't that underscore just how difficult unified Republican leadership is actually going to be?",
      "SEN. BARRASSO: No results matter, and we're united with the results. And when President Trump met with us for a couple of hours, the senators this past week, he said, I don't care how many bills, we just want to get it done. There are urgent needs and I'd like to get addressed immediately. You take a look at what happened this week in the Senate. There was actually bipartisanship, because the first bill that we brought to the Senate floor, the Laken Riley bill, is about a wonderful young woman, 22, a nursing student in Georgia who was out for a jog. Brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant. Somebody who was a criminal in this country should have either been in jail or deported, but he was done- Neither of those were done under the Biden administration. We had bipartisan support now, even though Chuck Schumer blocked that bill last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to talk about that with one of the Democratic senators who supported it later on in the program. Senator Barrasso, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: As we begin what's now day six of the catastrophic fires in Southern California, the situation is still extremely volatile and therefore still very dangerous. The death toll stands at 16, with 150,000 residents under evacuation orders.",
      "The long-term impact on Californians' health and damage done to the environment are incalculable. The cost to rebuild in California, which boasts the largest economy in America, are impossible to tally at this point.",
      "The causes for the individual fires are under investigation, but scientists say there's no question that climate change exacerbated the factors leading to these cataclysmic events.",
      "The two big fires, the coastal Palisades Fire and the inland Eaton Fires, are still raging and the National Weather Service has cited red flag wind warnings in the Southern California area through at least Wednesday.",
      "We begin with the very latest from our Jonathan Vigliotti.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI (voice-over): More than 14,000 personnel from all over California, nine states, as well as Canada and Mexico, have mobilized to the bone-dry hills of Los Angeles, battling four active and sprawling wildfires menacing millions of people across the region.",
      "The massive Palisades Fire, the largest in the city, has grown to nearly 25,000 acres, destroying an estimated 75 percent of Pacific Palisades. Officials say that one-third of the eastern edge of Malibu has been destroyed too. The Palisades Fired now threatens nearby Brentwood and Encino, where additional evacuation orders have been issued.",
      "A brief break in the wind allowed aircraft to gain 11 percent containment Saturday as the region was bombarded with water and flame retarded. But planes were briefly grounded after drones were spotted in the airspace.",
      "In Altadena, the Eaton Fire has destroyed more than 14,000 acres and reduced thousands of homes to ash. That fire is now 27 percent contained. Officials say the rash of fires have burned through more than 40,000 acres and more than 12,000 structures have been destroyed, a city under siege.",
      "L.A. Mayor Karen Bass is now facing calls to resign from a growing number of people who say the city's response was inadequate.",
      "My question to you is, what explains this lack of preparation and rapid response?",
      "KAREN BASS (D-Mayor of Los Angeles, California): When we are safe, when lives have been saved and homes have been saved, we will absolutely do an evaluation.",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: Her own fire chief has said budget cuts hampered firefighting efforts.",
      "KRISTIN CROWLEY (Los Angeles City, California, Fire Chief): We are screaming to be properly funded to make sure that our firefighters can do their jobs.",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: The cause of the fires are still under investigation, and the National Guard is on scene to prevent looting and enforce a nightly curfew.",
      "(End VT)",
      "JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: And red flag warnings are back in effect.",
      "Wind gusts could exceed 50 miles per hour. Meanwhile, officials are preemptively cutting power in some neighborhoods to prevent more fires from sparking, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonathan Vigliotti reporting from Pacific Palisades, stay safe, and thank you.",
      "We turn now to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "DEANNE CRISWELL (FEMA Administrator): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These Santa Ana winds are forecast to continue into the next week, and that could fuel some of the blazes. What is your biggest area of concern right now?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, with these winds coming back, and them issuing the red flag warnings, you know, these winds change the \u2013 the dynamics of this fire.",
      "And so I'm concerned for the safety of our firefighters, concerned for their ability continue to contain this fire. And I want people to make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying, so they can stay safe and they can stay out of harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know the winds themselves are rare for this particular time of year, but Los Angeles and the area, they have got a lot of experience with wildfires. They have a lot of regulation and a large firefighting force.",
      "Do you have a sense at this point why the area was so unprepared?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: I think that they were very prepared. This is something that they are very used to. They fight fires all the time.",
      "But they have never seen 100-mile-an-hour winds that are fueling the fire, and those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but, more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days.",
      "And because it was in such a populated area, it just makes it that much more challenging to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter, but as well try to save as many homes as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the federal response and the support you're giving to local authorities, President Biden spoke a few times from the Oval Office this week, and he did mention the need to move power lines underground.",
      "Do you know, were the power lines a cause of any of these blazes?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any information on the cause, and I think that's certainly going to be something that's going to be, you know, under investigation.",
      "But I think, when we think about moving the power lines underground, it's not just from the cause, but it's also, how do you keep the power on when we have these severe weather incidents? When you underground them, you create a more resilient community, and it can withstand the impacts of all of these different types of storms, whether it's fires or hurricanes. And we want to be able to keep these communities energized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will that be a requirement for any federal support for the rebuild?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: It's not going to be a requirement for us unless it's part of their local code, right? And we want to be able to enforce the local codes that they have, and so we'll work closely with California, also using this as an opportunity.",
      "You know, even if it's not a requirement, is this something that they want to be able to do? We have additional ways that we can fund that through our programs as they begin the rebuilding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has indicated he's looking at a number of executive orders. If local environmental regulations are loosened here in order to help quickly rebuild, does that concern you at all? And will it make it more complicated for people to obtain insurance, which we already know is quite expensive and hard for many Californians to get?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, the insurance piece is a real concern.",
      "We've, you know, heard the stories of so many people that have lost their insurance prior to this event. And that's the number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process.",
      "And so what I think we want to be able to do is, we want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there, right, that we rebuild in a way that makes them stronger, and reducing the impact, so they want to stay in these communities, and they don't have to lose the insurance carriers.",
      "We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to \u2013 to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But many of these policies were already canceled months ago, as we've been reporting.",
      "So, should the government, though, be in the business of stepping in and helping people rebuild if the private market has deemed these areas just too risky?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, our programs really help jump- start the recovery process. But, without insurance, families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild.",
      "But, again, it's not necessarily just where you rebuild. It's going to be how. And we want to be able to do things that can encourage families to rebuild their homes in a way that make them more fire-resistant. You know, we have a lot of science and technology out there that shows ways that we can make these homes stronger and more resistant against these fires. That's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said that 100 percent of the firefighting costs will be picked up for six months on the federal tab, but there is the separate issue of individual assistance to victims who lost their homes.",
      "We checked, and Congress set the maximum FEMA grant level at just short of $44,000. It's very expensive living in California. Does that need to be raised? Should Congress do that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: So, again, our programs aren't designed to replace insurance. Our programs are designed to jump-start the recovery process.",
      "And we know that in \u2013 in many areas, not just California, that, you know, that is not going to be enough to rebuild a home, which is why insurance is so important. We'll work with other partners. And one of our greatest partners is the Small Business Administration that can do low-interest loans to these families to give them another resource to help rebuild.",
      "We'll also work with our nonprofit partners, philanthropic partners, bringing the whole society together, so we can work with each family to help them figure out the right tools that they're going to need and the decisions that they're going to have to make as they go down this recovery journey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're describing a really costly enterprise here. I have seen estimates on damages that range from $60 billion to $130 billion. Do you have any ballpark figure at this point?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it would seem, according to President Biden, that Congress is going to have to do more.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any good estimates right now.",
      "And I think it's important to remember that these fires are still burning, which means damage is still happening. But the cost for this disaster, both from just the physical infrastructure, but also the economic losses, they're going to be significant. There's going to be other programs that congress can work through, like HUD's Community Development Block Grant for Disaster program, that can also help cover some of the things that FEMA's programs don't cover, or other parts of the insurance industry.",
      "There's a wide variety of different tools and resources that can be used that need to be authorized by Congress to really help this community on this road to recovery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we appreciate you joining us today to get the message out.",
      "Administrator Criswell, good luck to you.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to California Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu.",
      "Part of her district has been affected by the Eaton Fire, and she joins us from the Pasadena Convention Center, currently sheltering more than 500 local residents.",
      "Good morning to you, Congresswoman.",
      "I know 11 of these reported deaths were in your community. How are you, and do you know if the community is out of the danger zone at this point?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU (D-California): It is not out of the danger zone.",
      "We have another Santa Ana gust of winds that will happen Monday or Tuesday. They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe. Last week, the winds were between 80 to 100 miles per hour. Nonetheless, they could spread the fire.",
      "And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all to make sure that they are safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand that there were water pressure issues in the Altadena area. There was no local police or fire department. You all rely on the county for that kind of resource.",
      "Do you think, going forward, does this need to change? Have you talked to the governor?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We have been in touch with the governor.",
      "But what I want to do is to assure people that there is enough water. And, in fact, the fire department agencies have assured me that there is enough. But when the fires first happened, there was a combination of drastic winds and the fire. And, as a result, they were overwhelmed. This \u2013 this is not an ordinary incident.",
      "And many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off, so that there would not spark anymore fires. So, that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine a lot of the people in that shelter behind you are just wondering when they'll be able to go and see what's left of their neighborhoods.",
      "The state of California, as we understand it, put a moratorium Thursday on insurers dropping Californians from \u2013 from coverage. But it raises these questions of, are these communities going to be rebuilt and should they be rebuilt?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: These communities have to be rebuilt.",
      "I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena, and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas. And we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here.",
      "So, this is why, after I took the tour of the devastated areas witness \u2013 with our FEMA administrator, I decided to arrange for a tour of our California congressmembers, which took place just yesterday, so that they could see the devastation for themselves. We need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your Republican colleagues went on FOX, Congressman Warren Davidson, and said he'd oppose having an open checkbook approach to a place that, no matter how bad your policies are, would be crazy.",
      "He said it sounds like he wants strings attached to further aid. Have you talked to Republican leadership? Have you talked to Speaker Johnson yet about coming to California?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We are planning to invite Speaker Johnson, as well as President Trump, to come to this area and to witness the devastation for themselves.",
      "We have already been in touch with Republican congressmembers, and they have expressed that they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on. You know, these wildfires don't have any political affiliation. They don't belong to any political party.",
      "This devastation has affected thousands upon thousands of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands and are trying to rebuild. And they need help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of that help, first, they have to figure out if their insurance covers anything. Then they can go to the federal government for help. But FEMA has a grant limit of $44,000.",
      "It's Congress that set that limit. Does that need to be raised? And are you hearing from your constituents that they are getting help, they're able to access these resources?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: Well, first of all, I want to say that FEMA is opening a local assistance center on Tuesday, and anybody can walk in or call and get the assistance that they need.",
      "Actually, there are temporary locations too happening even today and tomorrow at the local libraries. FEMA is also here at this Pasadena Convention Center. And so there are many ways in which people can get help. They \u2013 of course, what we are encouraging everybody to do is to sign up on DisasterAssistance.gov immediately to get the process going.",
      "Of course, they will have to have their insurance information available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see if raising the amount of assistance or what changes to assistance are made in the coming weeks and months.",

      "But even beyond the cyber theft, there's another part of the Chinese cyber threat that I think has not gotten the attention publicly that it, I think, desperately deserves. And that is Chinese government's prepositioning on American civilian critical infrastructure to lie in wait on those networks to be in a position to wreak havoc, and can inflict real-world harm at a time and place of their choosing.",
      "SCOTT PELLEY: The Chinese have already insinuated malware into critical American infrastructure?",
      "DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY: That's correct.",

      "Everyone in the Wyoming National Guard is there on the scene helping with manpower as well as equipment. When you see what's being shown on television, in addition to the tragedy on the ground, you're also seeing gross mismanagement in California by elected officials.",
      "And it's heartbreaking to hear the fire chief say that they've diverted all of this money away from the fire department to be used for social programs, when they were already stretched too thin. So, yes, I expect there's going to be hearings. There's going to be requests of Congress.",
      "There can't be a blank check on this, however, because people want to make sure that, as rebuilding occurs, as things go on in California, they have to be resilient, so that these sorts of things can't happen again. And the policies of the liberal administration out there, I believe, have made these fires worse.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect, though, that Congress and Republicans will still help these Americans in need, even if they don't like their local politics in the party?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I expect that there will be strings attached to money that is ultimately approved, and it has to do with being ready the next time, because this was a gross failure this time.",

      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, let's start with, we were elected, Republicans are now in the House, the Senate and the White House because Americans wanted safety and prosperity.",
      "So you're right. The rubber hits the road this week with all of these hearings on the Cabinet. And then, when President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders, a blizzard of executive orders, on the economy, as well as on the border.",
      "So, when we met with President Trump just this \u2013 earlier this past week, what President Trump said, the number one goal for the Senate needs to be to get his team in place. I have met with just about all of them. I support every one of these nominees. As the whip, my job is to make sure they get across the finish line, get on the job.",

      "Senator, you are the whip. You count the votes. Does Pete Hegseth, the pick to run the Pentagon, have them?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, he certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon. He knows about a fit fighting force. He is very qualified. In my opinion, he has a record - a distinguished record of service in the military.",
      "Every senator gets to speak for themselves, and they will do that. The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential. People will listen and make their own decision. People have already had chances to ask questions, and they're going to continue to do so. I expect he's going to have quality answers to the questions that they ask.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who is a sexual assault survivor herself, did say last month that she wanted the FBI to vet the claims against Mr. Hegseth that were made by an accuser who said that he raped her. He denies that that assault happened. He claims it was consensual sex despite her filing of that police report.",
      "She also asked that the results be presented to the committee. Is that FBI vetting being shared with members of the Armed Services Committee?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Joni is a warrior. She is a patriot. I know she's had a chance to meet with the nominee at least twice. And advise and consent is about giving advice, as well as asking consent. She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday. And she'll ultimately make her decision.",
      "With regard to the FBI report, it's reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already. Traditionally, those reports do not get shared with the other members of the committee. That goes back four decades -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Back when, you know, John McCain was chairman of the committee. And I support the chairman in that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's why it is so notable that such a prominent member and other senators are asking to see FBI vetting.",
      "Do you prefer that the details of that sexual assault be disclosed in a public hearing, or would you support that those private investigative details be shared with members at the discretion of the chairman?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the chairman is going to make that decision, and I support the chairman. I also support Pete Hegseth.",
      "If you take a look at the current nominee compared to who's been in the Pentagon the last four years where they had a woke military, where recruitment went down, morale went down, I think Pete is going to be terrific in terms of recruitment, in terms of morale, in terms of returning America to a fighting force, which is what the American people really want. They want to make sure, if our military is called upon, they're ready to go, that they are ready to fight, and that with intimidating power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to correct myself, alleged sexual assault.",
      "So, let me ask you about another nominee, or nominee to be. One to run the intelligence community and oversee all the agencies. It appears the only member of Mr. Trump's national security team that doesn't have a real scheduled hearing is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it the FBI background check that's holding things up, or is it the ethics disclosure that's a problem?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes, I support Tulsi Gabbard. She is amazing in that she has been a member of Congress and a combat veteran, a decorated combat veteran for work under fire in Iraq.",
      "You're right, it's a paperwork problem right now with the Office of Government Ethics. We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. It looks like it's going to be the following week. But she continues to have promotions in the military. She's a lieutenant colonel. She now has top- level security clearances. She is the right person to keep America secure and safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She took the unusual measure of releasing a public statement reversing some past policy positions she'd taken when it came to surveillance.",
      "Are you concerned that you don't have enough Republicans who are willing to vote for her?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I'm not concerned at all about that. Senator Tom Cotton, who's chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has met with her on numerous occasions. She will have a hearing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: She has to raise her right hand, take an oath at the time. She will be telling the truth.",
      "And the issue that you just raised, which is foreign surveillance, she is now of the mind and the position that is consistent with the chairman of the committee and Republican members of the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned shock and awe on day one of Mr. Trump's new term with executive orders, but some of this action is also going to require congressional help.",
      "This week, President Biden banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in 625 meters of the - of the ocean - excuse me, miles. Are you going to reverse that in the first reconciliation bill that Leader Thune told us about?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, what President Biden just did by executive order, I expect that President Trump will eliminate with executive orders as well.",
      "In terms of the reconciliation bill, we need results. The results are what matters. We were sent here - and President Trump says he doesn't care if it's one bill, two bills, three bills, he wants results that we are united, on securing the border, on bringing down costs for American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He wanted -",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: He - across what - we want to make sure that tax cuts don't - don't expire. We want to make sure that the country is safe and strong. Those are the issues that the American people elected us to do. That's what we're here to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up there, Mr. Trump has said one big, beautiful bill is what he wants. It seems procedural, but we know from - from the Senate side you would prefer two different reconciliation bills at two different times to tackle some of these big agenda items.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Again -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you hear that the speaker of the House says it's got to be one, because he can only get one thing through, doesn't that underscore just how difficult unified Republican leadership is actually going to be?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No. Results matter. And we're united with the results.",
      "And when President Trump met with us for a couple of hours, the senators, this past week, he said, I don't care how many bills, we just want to get it done. There are urgent needs that I'd like to get addressed immediately.",
      "You - you take a look at what happened this week in the Senate. There was actually bipartisanship because the first bill that we brought to the Senate floor, the Laken Riley bill, was about a wonderful young woman, 22, a nursing student in Georgia who was out for a jog, brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Somebody who was a criminal in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Should have either been in jail or deported. But he was done - neither of those were done under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: We have bipartisan support now even though Chuck Schumer blocked the bill last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to talk about that with one of the Democratic senators who supported it later on in the program.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Great.",

      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's going to be a very busy week in the Senate.",
      "Before I get to those confirmation hearings, I want to follow up on what the FBI director told our Scott Pelley there in describing some of the Chinese hacking and what incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz called cyber time bombs throughout U.S. infrastructure.",
      "What needs to happen? What do the consequences need to be for China having done this and remaining in our infrastructure?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, we've got to be strong in standing up to them and explaining to them and, in some cases, I think, consequences need to be serious. There are things that we can do. We have the tools. But I would say, even beyond that, we've got to figure out a way to get them off of the infrastructure.",
      "With regards to the telecom system, multiple companies, you know, Chinese, cyber, software, are currently on those systems. And we're working to try to fix this. Some of this is going to require that the - the telecom companies upgrade their infrastructure that could be costly. We're currently working with them to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's pretty incredible that this espionage happened in the first place and expelling them is so hard to do.",
      "I want to also ask you about another Chinese question, and that has to do with TikTok, because the attorney for the company said they will go dark next Sunday unless the Supreme Court intervenes and stops this national security law from taking effect or delays it, as Mr. Trump has asked the court to do. What do you think is going to happen here?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, based on the oral argument in the case two days ago, it looks like the Supreme Court - I mean I don't really want to speculate, but it does look like they're going to uphold the law that we pass.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, I think on the 19th, so one day before - before the inauguration, you know, TikTok, on our systems, on our servers, become something that's now been banned by Congress. So, I imagine there's going to be a disruption in the service here, you know, starting on the 19th.",
      "I know this is controversial. I know there are folks out there that earn a living, you know, on TikTok. But it has a national security risk to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: You know, one is the data. One of the risks. The thing that I'm more concerned about is their ability to manipulate the population of the United States, especially in time of a conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, it was the right decision. I voted for it. And it looks like the Supreme Court is going to uphold the legislation that we passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll track that story.",
      "I want to follow up on something Senator Barrasso brought up, which was the Laken Riley Act. You say you support this. It's a bill that would require federal authorities to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft- related crimes rather than releasing them on parole. This bill was introduced last Congress. It didn't go anywhere. Was it wrong for Democrats not to take it up? Was it election year politics that made Democrats concerned about bringing it forward?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, in the last year we've been working with Republicans on bipartisan border security, legislation, with the hope of getting that passed, and then moving on to comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think we could do that. I think there's a lot of - you know, there's - you know, there's an effort. I think that's going to continue. You know, right now, this is certainly bipartisan. I voted for cloture on the, you know, motion to start talking about it. And, ultimately, I'll vote to - to pass it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But do you regret not doing that - taking that position earlier?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Democrats were more muscular on this issue, which was such a live issue during the campaign.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I mean, the Laken Riley Act is very specific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I mean it does one specific thing. We were working on something that was much more comprehensive, money for border patrol agents and hiring and infrastructure, policy changes. And policy changes, you know, you really have to do in a bipartisan way. We can't do that through the reconciliation process you were talking about.",
      "So, there is - you know, I think there's - there's going to be an effort ongoing. This is bipartisan. You're right, we didn't do this a year ago. You know, maybe we should have. But we were working on bipartisan border security legislation. We weren't able to get that across the finish line. I hope we can do that in this Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to two of the - two of the picks here. You sit on the Armed Services Committee. Typically, only the ranking and chairs of the committees get to see the FBI background check on a nominee. But as you know, many senators are asking for more information on Pete Hegseth here.",
      "Do you have any information from the ranking member of the committee, from Senator Reid, that you will get access or get any information from that FBI background check?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Margaret, let me just start by saying, there is not a job that's more serious and more critical to our national security than secretary of defense. And we need a qualified individual in that job. And he just does not seem to have the qualifications.",
      "And then on top of that, you look at his personal conduct, especially when he was managing Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans of America. You know, these two organizations were financially mismanaged. There was reports of being intoxicated on the job and creating an environment, you know, where there was, you know, some issues with, you know, sexual harassment.",
      "So, I think it's in the nominee, Mr. Hegseth's best interests, if he wants to be confirmed for this job, for us to have all the information. You know, the information from these organizations, but also the FBI background check. Right now, as you say, the chairman and the ranking member are going to get it. That's an agreement with the White House.",
      "But there has been exceptions made in the past for certain nominees. This clearly - because it is bipartisan. Like a - you know, across the aisle, folks want to see the FBI background check. I think we should get an opportunity to take a look at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting that your - that the ranking member had been briefed as of Friday. Are - you're saying no information has been shared?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Do you think it will be before Tuesday when the hearing -",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Not yet. I don't know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think, you know, we will have an opportunity. You know, I'll talk to the ranking member. And I also talked to the chairman about this, about his nomination in general. More so the discussion I had with Roger Wicker was about just meeting with Mr. Hegseth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Y Es.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: We've reached out to him multiple times, have not been able to schedule a meeting in my office, and he's not meeting with any other Democrats on the committee other than the ranking member.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: More information is better. If - if he wants to be confirmed for this job -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think it's in our best interest to have everything put out on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Intelligence Committee. Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, she is controversial as well. Republican Senator Capito was on Fox today and said, when she privately met with Tulsi Gabbard, she pressed her on that 2017 trip to Syria that came in the wake of a chemical weapons attack carried out by dictator Bashar al Assad against civilians. Gabbard told her, she said, that she didn't even know she was going to Syria, that she intended to go to Lebanon on the scheduled visit and ended up in Syria. Is that a credible answer?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I talked to Congresswoman Gabbard this week, met with her in my office. We talked about the trip to Syria. She didn't tell me that part. I mean I think it's kind of unusual that you wind up in one place that wasn't part of the plan.",
      "But what concerns me more, especially about that trip, is, it was common knowledge that Assad was gassing the civilian population, using chemical weapons against the population multiple times. And she didn't argue about those. But she took the time and the effort to make a case that there were two cases. And she used, you know, experts that were not credible to try to - try to prove that he was not using chemical weapons in those two instances.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I have a hard time understanding why you would want to do that, to use your political capital to try to prove something when there are multiple cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And, you know, on top of that, when you look at, you know, what's - what, in Russia, with misinformation -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: She does seem to have a predilection for misinformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And for not having -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see.",

      "NEWT GINGRICH (Former U.S. House Speaker): Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this documentary, you tell the stories of these individuals who immigrated to the U.S. And they were very successful people, like Albert Einstein.",
      "You know, when you look at Einstein and you look at Henry Kissinger, they were refugees to this country. Donald Trump set refugee admissions at very low levels first term. He's talking about block refugee admissions this term. Is that a mistake?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think - I think we're going through a period of, frankly, reacting to an extraordinarily disastrous immigration policy, so you're going to have some twists and turns. In the long run, we do want to have an ability to allow legitimate refugees to come here. We also, and part of the reason Callista and I made this documentary for PBS is, we really believe strongly that legal immigrants are a major contribution to America's success and to its exceptional nature. And we want to make sure that, you know, as many Americans favor legal immigration as oppose to illegal immigration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: It's very important to distinguish the two. And we want to strongly communicate that legal immigration in a variety of forms, refugees is one, another is various work permits, but we want people to be able to come to America if they do so legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said immigrants inhabit the very soul of what it is to be an American. When you say legitimate refugees, what do you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think people can stand up and say, I have now decided I'm a refugee, I feel threatened. The question is, is it true or not? Are they really threatened? Or, in fact, is that just their way of getting into the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Claim asylum, you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: To claim asylum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're -",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: I think there's a big - there's a big difference between somebody who genuinely faces a potential loss of life or freedom and somebody who simply wants to come to America and decides to claim that status.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic migrants there.",
      "Let me ask you, someone else you feature in here, Zalmay Khalilzad, a very prominent Afghan American who brokered Trump's deal with the Taliban to exit Afghanistan. As you know with that chaotic exit, there were tens of thousands of Afghans scattered, some of them still separated from their families. Many of them worked for the U.S. government.",
      "Should Mr. Trump extend the legal process of this program and bring those Afghans here? And would you ask Congress to raise the current cap they have on the number of them coming?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: You know, I think the Afghan refugees who actively fought on the side of Americans, saved American lives, tried to help win against the Taliban, I think they deserve an unusual level of support and treatment. And I worked all during the period of President Biden's insanely disastrous withdrawal. I tried to work with various people and did podcasts with people who were trying to get folks out of Afghanistan who should legitimately have been helped by the U.S. government.",
      "So, you know, when somebody's totally your ally, and this happened with the Vietnamese in the Vietnamese war. When somebody's totally your ally and they risk their lives side-by-side with you, you shouldn't abandon them. All right, that's a pretty straightforward rule.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things the Biden administration blamed the Trump administration for was the difficulty in making those fast arrangements to bring those Afghans here. And that's a story for another day. But the person they put their finger on as making it more difficult is Steven Miller, who is now the top policy adviser to Mr. Trump. He did add new requirements to visas, other things that made it harder to legally come here. Have you spoken to him about some of your concerns?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: No. I know Steven very well.",
      "Look, so Steven was responding to a disastrous level of immigration that's not sustainable. And I think that's - I think virtually every American agrees, you can't have an open border, you can't have Venezuelan gangs, for example, or El Salvadorans gangs. I mean there are a lot of good reasons. And you're going to get some overreaction, but it's an overreaction, frankly, caused by people like President Biden who were totally irresponsible in allowing people into this country by the millions in a way that was totally illegal.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Rep. Judy Chu, Democrat of California, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to California Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu, part of her district has been affected by the Eaton fire, and she joins us from the Pasadena Convention Center, currently sheltering more than 500 local residents. Good morning to you, Congresswoman. I know 11 of these reported deaths were in your community. How are you and do you know if the community is out of the danger zone at this point?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: It is not out of the danger zone. We have another Santa Ana gust of winds that will happen Monday or Tuesday. They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe. Last week, the winds were between 80 to 100 miles per hour, nonetheless, they could spread the fire. And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all, to make sure that they are safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand that there were water pressure issues in the Altadena area. There was no local police or fire department. You all rely on the county for that kind of resource. Do you think going forward, does this need to change? Have you talked to the governor?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: We have been in touch with the governor, but what I want to do is to assure people that there is enough water, and in fact, the fire department agencies have assured me that there is enough, but when the fires first happened, there was a combination of drastic winds and the fire and as a result, they were overwhelmed. This-this is not an ordinary incident, and many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off so that there would not spark anymore fire. So that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine a lot of the people in that shelter behind you are just wondering when they'll be able to go and see what's left of their neighborhoods. The state of California, as we understand it, put a moratorium Thursday on insurers dropping Californians from- from coverage. But it raises these questions of, are these communities going to be rebuilt and should they be rebuilt?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: These communities have to be rebuilt. I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena, and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas, and we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here. So this is why, after I took the tour of the devastated areas with-with our FEMA administrator, I decided to arrange for a tour of our California Congress members, which took place just yesterday, so that they could see the devastation for themselves. We need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your Republican colleagues, went on Fox, Congressman Warren Davidson, and said he'd oppose having an open checkbook approach to a place that, no matter how bad your policies are, would be crazy. He said it sounds like he wants strings attached to further aid. Have you talked to Republican leadership? Have you talked to Speaker Johnson yet about coming to California?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: We are planning to invite speaker Johnson as well as President Trump, to come to this area and to witness the devastation for themselves. We have already been in touch with Republican Congress members, and they have expressed that they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on. You know, these wildfires don't have any political affiliation. They don't belong to any political party. This devastation has affected 1000s upon 1000s of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands, and are trying to rebuild, and they need help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in terms of that help, first, they have to figure out if their insurance covers anything, then they can go to the federal government for help. But FEMA has a grant. Limit of $44,000 it's Congress that set that limit. Does that need to be raised? And are you hearing from your constituents that they are getting help? They're able to access these resources?",
      "REP. JUDY CHU: Well, first of all, I want to say that FEMA is opening a local assistance center on Tuesday, and anybody can walk in or call and get the assistance that they need. Actually, there are temporary locations too, happening even today and tomorrow at the local libraries. FEMA is also here at this Pasadena Convention Center. And so there are many ways in which people can get help. They- of course, what we are encouraging everybody to do is to sign up on Disasterassistance.gov immediately to get the process going. Of course, they will have to have their insurance information available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see if raising the amount of assistance or what changes to assistance are made in the coming weeks and months. Congresswoman, Chu, thank you, and we wish you and your community the best of luck.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonathan Vigliotti, thank you. We turn now to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "FEMA ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Santa Ana winds are forecast to continue into the next week, and that could fuel some of the blazes. What is your biggest area of concern right now?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: You know, with these winds coming back, and them issuing the red flag warnings, you know, these winds change the- the dynamics of this fire, and so I'm concerned for the safety of our firefighters, concerned for their ability continue to contain this fire, and I want people to make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying, so they can stay safe and they can stay out of harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know the winds themselves are rare for this particular time of year, but Los Angeles, in the area, they got a lot of experience with wildfires. They have a lot of regulation and a large firefighting force. Do you have a sense at this point why the area was so unprepared?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: I think that they were very prepared. This is something that they are very used to, they fight fires all the time. But they have never seen 100 mile an hour winds that are fueling the fire, and those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days. And because it was in such a populated area, it just makes it that much more challenging to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter, but as well, try to save as many homes as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the federal response and the support you're given to local authorities, President Biden spoke a few times from the oval office this week, and he did mention the need to move power lines underground. Do you know, were the power lines a cause of any of these blazes?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, I don't have any information on the cause, and I think that's certainly going to be something that's going to be, you know, under investigation. But I think when we think about moving the power lines underground, it's not just from the cause, but it's also, how do you keep the power on when we have these severe weather incidents? When you underground them, you create a more resilient community, and it can withstand the impacts of all of these different types of storms, whether it's fires or hurricanes, and we want to be able to keep these communities energized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will that be a requirement for any federal support for the rebuild?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: It's not going to be a requirement for us unless it's part of their local code, right? And we want to be able to enforce the local codes that they have, and so we'll work closely with California. It's also using this as an opportunity. You know, even if it's not a requirement, is this something that they want to be able to do? We have additional ways that we can fund that through our programs as they begin the rebuilding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has indicated he's looking at a number of executive orders. If local environmental regulations are loosened here in order to help quickly rebuild, does that concern you at all? And will it make it more complicated for people to obtain ob- insurance, which we already know is quite expensive and hard for many Californians to get.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: You know, the insurance piece is a real concern. We've, you know, heard the stories of so many people that have lost their insurance prior to this event, and that's the number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process. And so what I think we want to be able to do is we want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there, right, that we rebuild in a way that makes them stronger, and reducing the impact so they want to stay in these communities, and they don't have to to lose the insurance carriers. We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to- to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, many of these policies were already canceled months ago, as we've been reporting. So should the government, though, be in the business of stepping in and helping people rebuild if the private market has deemed these areas just too risky?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: You know, our programs really help jump start the recovery process, but without insurance, families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild. But again, it's not necessarily just where you rebuild, it's going to be how. And we want to be able to do things that can encourage families to rebuild their homes in a way that make them more fire resistant. You know, we have a lot of science and technology out there that shows ways that we can make these homes stronger and more resistant against these fires. That's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said that 100% of the firefighting costs will be picked up for six months on the federal tab, but there is the separate issue of individual assistance to victims who lost their homes. We checked, and Congress set the maximum FEMA grant level at just short of $44,000. It's very expensive living in California. Does that need to be raised? Should Congress do that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: So again, our programs aren't designed to replace insurance. Our programs are designed to jump start the recovery process, and we know that in- in many areas, not just California, that you know that is not going to be enough to rebuild a home, which is why insurance is so important. We'll work with other partners, and one of our greatest partners is the Small Business Administration that can do low interest loans to these families to give them another resource to help rebuild. We'll also work with our nonprofit partners, philanthropic partners, bringing the whole society together so we can work with each family to help them figure out the right tools that they're going to need and the decisions that they're going to have to make as they go down this recovery journey",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're describing a really costly enterprise here. I've seen estimates on damages that range from $60 to $130 billion. Do you have any ballpark figure at this point\u2013",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: \u2013No\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Because it would seem, according to President Biden, that Congress is going to have to do more.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, I don't have any good estimates right now, and I think it's important to remember that these fires are still burning, which means damage is still happening. But the cost for this disaster, both from just the physical infrastructure, but also the economic losses, they're going to be significant. There's going to be other programs that congress can work through, like HUD's Community Development Block Grant for Disaster program, that can also help cover some of the things that FEMA's programs don't cover, or other parts of the insurance industry. There's a wide variety of different tools and resources that can be used that need to be authorized by Congress to really help this community on this road to recovery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Congress did just provide more emergency funding in the supplemental. So this is- this is not a one time problem. This seems to be a recurring need to get more and more federal money here. Can you update us on where we are with the recovery in North Carolina?",
      "08:43:19",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, I mean, I'm glad you mentioned the funding, because we really were worried about that as we were going into the recovery in North Carolina, but we got bipartisan support from Congress and $27 billion into our disaster relief fund so we can support the response and recovery efforts for this fire, but also the ongoing recovery efforts that are happening across the six states that were impacted by Hurricane Helene, as well as Hurricane Milton. You know, we're continuing to work with- with Governor Stein, now in- in North Carolina, as he's working through the recovery piece and, you know, working on getting the debris removal out of the way so families can rebuild their homes, helping them restore the infrastructure. We still have so many people engaged in North Carolina helping with this recovery process, because we know it's going to be complicated. It's going to be complicated here in California, but we're going to bring in the right experts and the right staff to support them throughout that journey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Secretary Mayorkas recently told us that you all had to pull some federal workers out of the area, out of North Carolina, because of threats against them that's fueled by misinformation. Has that ended, or is that threat continuing?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL",
      "Yeah, I just want to be clear, we had one specific incident at one day during the response in North Carolina, where we pulled people from going door to door, but we always kept our facilities open, and we had people in all of those communities. But it's really unfortunate that we had to do that right because the misinformation was creating these harassing environments for our staff. We do- it is not like what we saw, you know, during those initial days in North Carolina, but we've put measures in place to make sure that our staff know that they're safe and that they're protected, and that we can continue to support people. They are going door to door, still talking to individuals, and we have these fixed facilities where individuals can come talk to us. But you know, this is going to be something we're going to have to face going forward is this level of misinformation that's going out there and getting people to know that they can access our programs, we're going to have to work closely with local officials on all these events to make sure we're getting the right information to the people that have been impacted.",

      "\"We want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there,\" Criswell said. \"We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.\"",
      "As part of building more resilient communities, Criswell also encouraged moving power lines underground, which in addition to reducing the possibility of causing wildfires also allows officials to keep power on during severe weather events.",
      "Criswell didn't provide an overarching figure for the total cost of the damage in Los Angeles, noting that the fires are still burning and damage is still occurring. But she urged that there are other programs Congress can work through to cover some of the damage, saying there's \"a wide variety of different tools and resources\" lawmakers can authorize \"to really help this community on this road to recovery.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:26:49 -0500",
    "summary": "After traveling more than a million miles on the job, the secretary of state discusses the Biden administration's foreign policy report card, from a reinvigorated NATO alliance and Russian aggression in Ukraine, to the ongoing turmoil in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "No easy stroll to the exit for Antony Blinken. With exactly eight days left as secretary of state, he's only just concluded what is likely his last trip back-and-forth across the globe, with meetings in Seoul, Tokyo, Paris and, finally, Rome.",
      "Blinken has traveled more than a million miles on the job. \"Every minute, every hour, every day of the time that we have left, we're focused on getting results,\" he said.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" flew with him in early December \u2013 three trips ago \u2013 from Washington to Brussels for the most recent NATO foreign ministers meeting. The main topic of discussion was Russian aggression in Ukraine.",
      "\"We have a new NATO strategic concept,\" said Blinken. \"It recognizes Russia as the most direct threat to the alliance.\"",
      "But there was a lot of well-wishing going on as well. Blinken stood right in the middle of the so-called \"family photo,\" and also photo-bombed a portrait of all the women foreign ministers.",
      "Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the secretary-general of NATO, told Blinken, \"You have been a staunch ally, and people like you very much.\"",
      "All this ceremonial show & tell might be seen as subtle messaging to the incoming Trump administration about the value of nurturing alliance \u2013 the \"stronger together\" argument. Blinken said, \"The instruction I got from President Biden on Day One was, get in there, rejuvenate, re-energize, and even re-imagine our alliances and partnerships.\"",
      "Here was one more chance for Blinken to hold up the Biden administration foreign policy report card \u2026 and his own. He explained, \"If the United States is not engaged, if we're not leading, then probably either someone else is (and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and our values), or maybe just as bad, no one is. What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"",
      "As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"",
      "President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"",
      "Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state.\u00a0 His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\"",
      "Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden.",
      "Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"",
      "It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\"",
      "Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.",
      "On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"",
      "Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\"",
      "And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\"",
      "He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie:",
      "What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over two investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, has resigned, according to a Justice Department court filing submitted on Saturday.",
      "CBS News recently reported Smith would resign from the Justice Department after completing his work.",
      "According to court documents, Smith \"separated from the Department on January 10.\" The revelation was made in a federal court filing amid an ongoing dispute between Justice Department officials and defense attorneys tied to the president-elect over the release of one volume of Smith's two-volume report.",
      "Attorneys for Trump's former codefendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira have sought to extend an order by Judge Aileen Cannon barring the Justice Department from releasing a portion of Smith's report.",
      "Regulations require special counsels to submit a report to the attorney general detailing their investigative findings and prosecutorial decisions. Garland has pledged to release to the public all reports completed under his tenure and has so far done so, including after an investigation into President Biden's handling of classified records.",
      "Court filings earlier this week revealed Smith had submitted a two-volume report to Garland on Jan. 7, just days after attorneys for Trump and his codefendants reviewed a draft report. Trump's attorneys subsequently wrote a letter to Garland asking him to remove Smith from his post and prevent the release of the report, according to court filings.",
      "Following the review, attorneys for Trump's codefendants asked Cannon, who initially dismissed one of Smith's cases against Trump in July, and judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to stop Garland from releasing the report.",
      "Smith was appointed in November of 2022 to take over two Justice Department investigations into Trump, one related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, and another tied to his handling of classified records after he left office. The cases both resulted in criminal charges against Trump. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Smith's dual cases against Trump were ultimately closed last year after Trump won the presidential election. Prosecutors wrote that Justice Department regulations forbid the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "The special counsel at the time opted to keep an appeal of Cannon's dismissal of the classified documents investigation open in the cases of Nauta and de Oliveira. It was in this case that their attorneys sought to prevent the release of the report, arguing doing so would prejudice their case.",
      "In response, the Justice Department revealed the attorney general would not release the volume of the report dealing with the classified documents probe until the case is completely closed, and instead make it available to a select group of members of Congress.",
      "Still, the defense attorneys and Trump's legal team have urged the federal courts to stop the release of the other portion of the report detailing Smith's probe into the 2020 election.",
      "Right now, the report remains unreleased after Cannon ordered the Justice Department to keep the report under wraps until at least Sunday. Judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Trump codefendants' bid to further enjoin prosecutors from releasing the report.",
      "Defense attorneys have now asked Cannon to extend her order forbidding the report's release, a move the Justice Department opposes.",

      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet, with 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other payloads weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck. There are no such payloads on the initial \"pathfinder\" flight, but the spacecraft will be thoroughly checked out in orbit.",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and now dominates the global commercial launch market, firing off 134 Falcon-family rockets last year and five so far in 2025. SpaceX has successfully recovered first stage boosters 395 times.",
      "SpaceX also is building a gargantuan new rocket -- the Super Heavy-Starship -- with a seventh test flight on tap as early as Monday from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, launch site. A variant of the rocket's Starship upper stage is being built for NASA to carry astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface as part of the Artemis program.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019 with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "Amazon plans its own fleet of more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper. The company says it has booked up to 95 launches with Blue Origin, the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"Once deployed, the Kuiper System will serve individual households, as well as schools, hospitals, businesses, disaster relief efforts, government agencies and other organizations operating in places without reliable broadband,\" Amazon says on its website.",
      "Whether Amazon can succeed against SpaceX in the space-based internet services market remains to be seen. But Blue Origin's New Glenn will provide an alternative to SpaceX when it comes to launch services.",
      "The rocket was designed from the ground up to be \"human rated,\" enabling astronaut flights at some point in the future. If successful, the rocket will eventually be used to launch NASA space probes, classified military payloads, commercial satellites, lunar cargo ships and even piloted moon landers for NASA.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",

      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",

Officials say that one-third of the eastern edge of Malibu has been destroyed too.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonathan Vigliotti reporting from Pacific Palisades, stay safe, and thank you.",
      "We turn now to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "DEANNE CRISWELL (FEMA Administrator): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These Santa Ana winds are forecast to continue into the next week, and that could fuel some of the blazes. What is your biggest area of concern right now?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, with these winds coming back, and them issuing the red flag warnings, you know, these winds change the \u2013 the dynamics of this fire.",
      "And so I'm concerned for the safety of our firefighters, concerned for their ability continue to contain this fire. And I want people to make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying, so they can stay safe and they can stay out of harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know the winds themselves are rare for this particular time of year, but Los Angeles and the area, they have got a lot of experience with wildfires. They have a lot of regulation and a large firefighting force.",
      "Do you have a sense at this point why the area was so unprepared?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: I think that they were very prepared. This is something that they are very used to. They fight fires all the time.",
      "But they have never seen 100-mile-an-hour winds that are fueling the fire, and those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but, more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days.",
      "And because it was in such a populated area, it just makes it that much more challenging to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter, but as well try to save as many homes as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the federal response and the support you're giving to local authorities, President Biden spoke a few times from the Oval Office this week, and he did mention the need to move power lines underground.",
      "Do you know, were the power lines a cause of any of these blazes?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any information on the cause, and I think that's certainly going to be something that's going to be, you know, under investigation.",
      "But I think, when we think about moving the power lines underground, it's not just from the cause, but it's also, how do you keep the power on when we have these severe weather incidents? When you underground them, you create a more resilient community, and it can withstand the impacts of all of these different types of storms, whether it's fires or hurricanes. And we want to be able to keep these communities energized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will that be a requirement for any federal support for the rebuild?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: It's not going to be a requirement for us unless it's part of their local code, right? And we want to be able to enforce the local codes that they have, and so we'll work closely with California, also using this as an opportunity.",
      "You know, even if it's not a requirement, is this something that they want to be able to do? We have additional ways that we can fund that through our programs as they begin the rebuilding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has indicated he's looking at a number of executive orders. If local environmental regulations are loosened here in order to help quickly rebuild, does that concern you at all? And will it make it more complicated for people to obtain insurance, which we already know is quite expensive and hard for many Californians to get?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, the insurance piece is a real concern.",
      "We've, you know, heard the stories of so many people that have lost their insurance prior to this event. And that's the number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process.",
      "And so what I think we want to be able to do is, we want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there, right, that we rebuild in a way that makes them stronger, and reducing the impact, so they want to stay in these communities, and they don't have to lose the insurance carriers.",
      "We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to \u2013 to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But many of these policies were already canceled months ago, as we've been reporting.",
      "So, should the government, though, be in the business of stepping in and helping people rebuild if the private market has deemed these areas just too risky?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: You know, our programs really help jump- start the recovery process. But, without insurance, families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild.",
      "But, again, it's not necessarily just where you rebuild. It's going to be how. And we want to be able to do things that can encourage families to rebuild their homes in a way that make them more fire-resistant. You know, we have a lot of science and technology out there that shows ways that we can make these homes stronger and more resistant against these fires. That's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said that 100 percent of the firefighting costs will be picked up for six months on the federal tab, but there is the separate issue of individual assistance to victims who lost their homes.",
      "We checked, and Congress set the maximum FEMA grant level at just short of $44,000. It's very expensive living in California. Does that need to be raised? Should Congress do that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: So, again, our programs aren't designed to replace insurance. Our programs are designed to jump-start the recovery process.",
      "And we know that in \u2013 in many areas, not just California, that, you know, that is not going to be enough to rebuild a home, which is why insurance is so important. We'll work with other partners. And one of our greatest partners is the Small Business Administration that can do low-interest loans to these families to give them another resource to help rebuild.",
      "We'll also work with our nonprofit partners, philanthropic partners, bringing the whole society together, so we can work with each family to help them figure out the right tools that they're going to need and the decisions that they're going to have to make as they go down this recovery journey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're describing a really costly enterprise here. I have seen estimates on damages that range from $60 billion to $130 billion. Do you have any ballpark figure at this point?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it would seem, according to President Biden, that Congress is going to have to do more.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, I don't have any good estimates right now.",
      "And I think it's important to remember that these fires are still burning, which means damage is still happening. But the cost for this disaster, both from just the physical infrastructure, but also the economic losses, they're going to be significant. There's going to be other programs that congress can work through, like HUD's Community Development Block Grant for Disaster program, that can also help cover some of the things that FEMA's programs don't cover, or other parts of the insurance industry.",
      "There's a wide variety of different tools and resources that can be used that need to be authorized by Congress to really help this community on this road to recovery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we appreciate you joining us today to get the message out.",
      "Administrator Criswell, good luck to you.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Yes, thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to California Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu.",
      "Part of her district has been affected by the Eaton Fire, and she joins us from the Pasadena Convention Center, currently sheltering more than 500 local residents.",
      "Good morning to you, Congresswoman.",
      "I know 11 of these reported deaths were in your community. How are you, and do you know if the community is out of the danger zone at this point?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU (D-California): It is not out of the danger zone.",
      "We have another Santa Ana gust of winds that will happen Monday or Tuesday. They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe. Last week, the winds were between 80 to 100 miles per hour. Nonetheless, they could spread the fire.",
      "And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all to make sure that they are safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand that there were water pressure issues in the Altadena area. There was no local police or fire department. You all rely on the county for that kind of resource.",
      "Do you think, going forward, does this need to change? Have you talked to the governor?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We have been in touch with the governor.",
      "But what I want to do is to assure people that there is enough water. And, in fact, the fire department agencies have assured me that there is enough. But when the fires first happened, there was a combination of drastic winds and the fire. And, as a result, they were overwhelmed. This \u2013 this is not an ordinary incident.",
      "And many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off, so that there would not spark anymore fires. So, that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine a lot of the people in that shelter behind you are just wondering when they'll be able to go and see what's left of their neighborhoods.",
      "The state of California, as we understand it, put a moratorium Thursday on insurers dropping Californians from \u2013 from coverage. But it raises these questions of, are these communities going to be rebuilt and should they be rebuilt?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: These communities have to be rebuilt.",
      "I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena, and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas. And we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here.",
      "So, this is why, after I took the tour of the devastated areas witness \u2013 with our FEMA administrator, I decided to arrange for a tour of our California congressmembers, which took place just yesterday, so that they could see the devastation for themselves. We need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your Republican colleagues went on FOX, Congressman Warren Davidson, and said he'd oppose having an open checkbook approach to a place that, no matter how bad your policies are, would be crazy.",
      "He said it sounds like he wants strings attached to further aid. Have you talked to Republican leadership? Have you talked to Speaker Johnson yet about coming to California?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: We are planning to invite Speaker Johnson, as well as President Trump, to come to this area and to witness the devastation for themselves.",
      "We have already been in touch with Republican congressmembers, and they have expressed that they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on. You know, these wildfires don't have any political affiliation. They don't belong to any political party.",
      "This devastation has affected thousands upon thousands of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands and are trying to rebuild. And they need help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of that help, first, they have to figure out if their insurance covers anything. Then they can go to the federal government for help. But FEMA has a grant limit of $44,000.",
      "It's Congress that set that limit. Does that need to be raised? And are you hearing from your constituents that they are getting help, they're able to access these resources?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: Well, first of all, I want to say that FEMA is opening a local assistance center on Tuesday, and anybody can walk in or call and get the assistance that they need.",
      "Actually, there are temporary locations too happening even today and tomorrow at the local libraries. FEMA is also here at this Pasadena Convention Center. And so there are many ways in which people can get help. They \u2013 of course, what we are encouraging everybody to do is to sign up on DisasterAssistance.gov immediately to get the process going.",
      "Of course, they will have to have their insurance information available.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see if raising the amount of assistance or what changes to assistance are made in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Congresswoman Chu, thank you, and we wish you and your community the best of luck.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU: Thank you.",

      "But even beyond the cyber theft, there's another part of the Chinese cyber threat that I think has not gotten the attention publicly that it, I think, desperately deserves. And that is Chinese government's prepositioning on American civilian critical infrastructure to lie in wait on those networks to be in a position to wreak havoc, and can inflict real-world harm at a time and place of their choosing.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a busy week ahead in the Senate.",
      "But, before I get to that business, I do want to ask you about these fires in California. Do you expect that Congress will have to provide an additional aid package? And, if so, when?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: What we're seeing is heartbreaking. It's horrible, affecting people, you know, old and young, rich and poor.",
      "Everyone in the Wyoming National Guard is there on the scene helping with manpower as well as equipment. When you see what's being shown on television, in addition to the tragedy on the ground, you're also seeing gross mismanagement in California by elected officials.",
      "And it's heartbreaking to hear the fire chief say that they've diverted all of this money away from the fire department to be used for social programs, when they were already stretched too thin. So, yes, I expect there's going to be hearings. There's going to be requests of Congress.",
      "There can't be a blank check on this, however, because people want to make sure that, as rebuilding occurs, as things go on in California, they have to be resilient, so that these sorts of things can't happen again. And the policies of the liberal administration out there, I believe, have made these fires worse.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect, though, that Congress and Republicans will still help these Americans in need, even if they don't like their local politics in the party?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I expect that there will be strings attached to money that is ultimately approved, and it has to do with being ready the next time, because this was a gross failure this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, let me move on to what's happening this week, because you are the whip. You are the vote-counter. You are watching very closely what these hearings for these picks made by Donald Trump will be like.",

      "Which nominees are you certain will be confirmed by January 20?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, let's start with, we were elected, Republicans are now in the House, the Senate and the White House because Americans wanted safety and prosperity.",
      "So you're right. The rubber hits the road this week with all of these hearings on the Cabinet. And then, when President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders, a blizzard of executive orders, on the economy, as well as on the border.",
      "So, when we met with President Trump just this \u2013 earlier this past week, what President Trump said, the number one goal for the Senate needs to be to get his team in place. I have met with just about all of them. I support every one of these nominees. As the whip, my job is to make sure they get across the finish line, get on the job.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation now with Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso.",
      "Senator, you are the whip. You count the votes. Does Pete Hegseth, the pick to run the Pentagon, have them?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, he certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon. He knows about a fit fighting force. He is very qualified. In my opinion, he has a record - a distinguished record of service in the military.",
      "Every senator gets to speak for themselves, and they will do that. The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential. People will listen and make their own decision. People have already had chances to ask questions, and they're going to continue to do so. I expect he's going to have quality answers to the questions that they ask.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who is a sexual assault survivor herself, did say last month that she wanted the FBI to vet the claims against Mr. Hegseth that were made by an accuser who said that he raped her. He denies that that assault happened. He claims it was consensual sex despite her filing of that police report.",
      "She also asked that the results be presented to the committee. Is that FBI vetting being shared with members of the Armed Services Committee?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Joni is a warrior. She is a patriot. I know she's had a chance to meet with the nominee at least twice. And advise and consent is about giving advice, as well as asking consent. She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday. And she'll ultimately make her decision.",
      "With regard to the FBI report, it's reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already. Traditionally, those reports do not get shared with the other members of the committee. That goes back four decades -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Back when, you know, John McCain was chairman of the committee. And I support the chairman in that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's why it is so notable that such a prominent member and other senators are asking to see FBI vetting.",
      "Do you prefer that the details of that sexual assault be disclosed in a public hearing, or would you support that those private investigative details be shared with members at the discretion of the chairman?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the chairman is going to make that decision, and I support the chairman. I also support Pete Hegseth.",
      "If you take a look at the current nominee compared to who's been in the Pentagon the last four years where they had a woke military, where recruitment went down, morale went down, I think Pete is going to be terrific in terms of recruitment, in terms of morale, in terms of returning America to a fighting force, which is what the American people really want. They want to make sure, if our military is called upon, they're ready to go, that they are ready to fight, and that with intimidating power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to correct myself, alleged sexual assault.",
      "So, let me ask you about another nominee, or nominee to be. One to run the intelligence community and oversee all the agencies. It appears the only member of Mr. Trump's national security team that doesn't have a real scheduled hearing is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it the FBI background check that's holding things up, or is it the ethics disclosure that's a problem?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes, I support Tulsi Gabbard. She is amazing in that she has been a member of Congress and a combat veteran, a decorated combat veteran for work under fire in Iraq.",
      "You're right, it's a paperwork problem right now with the Office of Government Ethics. We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. It looks like it's going to be the following week. But she continues to have promotions in the military. She's a lieutenant colonel. She now has top- level security clearances. She is the right person to keep America secure and safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She took the unusual measure of releasing a public statement reversing some past policy positions she'd taken when it came to surveillance.",
      "Are you concerned that you don't have enough Republicans who are willing to vote for her?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I'm not concerned at all about that. Senator Tom Cotton, who's chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has met with her on numerous occasions. She will have a hearing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: She has to raise her right hand, take an oath at the time. She will be telling the truth.",
      "And the issue that you just raised, which is foreign surveillance, she is now of the mind and the position that is consistent with the chairman of the committee and Republican members of the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned shock and awe on day one of Mr. Trump's new term with executive orders, but some of this action is also going to require congressional help.",
      "This week, President Biden banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in 625 meters of the - of the ocean - excuse me, miles. Are you going to reverse that in the first reconciliation bill that Leader Thune told us about?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, what President Biden just did by executive order, I expect that President Trump will eliminate with executive orders as well.",
      "In terms of the reconciliation bill, we need results. The results are what matters. We were sent here - and President Trump says he doesn't care if it's one bill, two bills, three bills, he wants results that we are united, on securing the border, on bringing down costs for American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He wanted -",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: He - across what - we want to make sure that tax cuts don't - don't expire. We want to make sure that the country is safe and strong. Those are the issues that the American people elected us to do. That's what we're here to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up there, Mr. Trump has said one big, beautiful bill is what he wants. It seems procedural, but we know from - from the Senate side you would prefer two different reconciliation bills at two different times to tackle some of these big agenda items.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Again -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you hear that the speaker of the House says it's got to be one, because he can only get one thing through, doesn't that underscore just how difficult unified Republican leadership is actually going to be?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No. Results matter. And we're united with the results.",
      "And when President Trump met with us for a couple of hours, the senators, this past week, he said, I don't care how many bills, we just want to get it done. There are urgent needs that I'd like to get addressed immediately.",
      "You - you take a look at what happened this week in the Senate. There was actually bipartisanship because the first bill that we brought to the Senate floor, the Laken Riley bill, was about a wonderful young woman, 22, a nursing student in Georgia who was out for a jog, brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Somebody who was a criminal in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Should have either been in jail or deported. But he was done - neither of those were done under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: We have bipartisan support now even though Chuck Schumer blocked the bill last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to talk about that with one of the Democratic senators who supported it later on in the program.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Great.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Barrasso, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tuscan, Arizona.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's going to be a very busy week in the Senate.",
      "Before I get to those confirmation hearings, I want to follow up on what the FBI director told our Scott Pelley there in describing some of the Chinese hacking and what incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz called cyber time bombs throughout U.S. infrastructure.",
      "What needs to happen? What do the consequences need to be for China having done this and remaining in our infrastructure?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, we've got to be strong in standing up to them and explaining to them and, in some cases, I think, consequences need to be serious. There are things that we can do. We have the tools. But I would say, even beyond that, we've got to figure out a way to get them off of the infrastructure.",
      "With regards to the telecom system, multiple companies, you know, Chinese, cyber, software, are currently on those systems. And we're working to try to fix this. Some of this is going to require that the - the telecom companies upgrade their infrastructure that could be costly. We're currently working with them to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's pretty incredible that this espionage happened in the first place and expelling them is so hard to do.",
      "I want to also ask you about another Chinese question, and that has to do with TikTok, because the attorney for the company said they will go dark next Sunday unless the Supreme Court intervenes and stops this national security law from taking effect or delays it, as Mr. Trump has asked the court to do. What do you think is going to happen here?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, based on the oral argument in the case two days ago, it looks like the Supreme Court - I mean I don't really want to speculate, but it does look like they're going to uphold the law that we pass.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, I think on the 19th, so one day before - before the inauguration, you know, TikTok, on our systems, on our servers, become something that's now been banned by Congress. So, I imagine there's going to be a disruption in the service here, you know, starting on the 19th.",
      "I know this is controversial. I know there are folks out there that earn a living, you know, on TikTok. But it has a national security risk to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: You know, one is the data. One of the risks. The thing that I'm more concerned about is their ability to manipulate the population of the United States, especially in time of a conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, it was the right decision. I voted for it. And it looks like the Supreme Court is going to uphold the legislation that we passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll track that story.",
      "I want to follow up on something Senator Barrasso brought up, which was the Laken Riley Act. You say you support this. It's a bill that would require federal authorities to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft- related crimes rather than releasing them on parole. This bill was introduced last Congress. It didn't go anywhere. Was it wrong for Democrats not to take it up? Was it election year politics that made Democrats concerned about bringing it forward?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, in the last year we've been working with Republicans on bipartisan border security, legislation, with the hope of getting that passed, and then moving on to comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think we could do that. I think there's a lot of - you know, there's - you know, there's an effort. I think that's going to continue. You know, right now, this is certainly bipartisan. I voted for cloture on the, you know, motion to start talking about it. And, ultimately, I'll vote to - to pass it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But do you regret not doing that - taking that position earlier?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Democrats were more muscular on this issue, which was such a live issue during the campaign.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I mean, the Laken Riley Act is very specific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I mean it does one specific thing. We were working on something that was much more comprehensive, money for border patrol agents and hiring and infrastructure, policy changes. And policy changes, you know, you really have to do in a bipartisan way. We can't do that through the reconciliation process you were talking about.",
      "So, there is - you know, I think there's - there's going to be an effort ongoing. This is bipartisan. You're right, we didn't do this a year ago. You know, maybe we should have. But we were working on bipartisan border security legislation. We weren't able to get that across the finish line. I hope we can do that in this Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to two of the - two of the picks here. You sit on the Armed Services Committee. Typically, only the ranking and chairs of the committees get to see the FBI background check on a nominee. But as you know, many senators are asking for more information on Pete Hegseth here.",
      "Do you have any information from the ranking member of the committee, from Senator Reid, that you will get access or get any information from that FBI background check?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Margaret, let me just start by saying, there is not a job that's more serious and more critical to our national security than secretary of defense. And we need a qualified individual in that job. And he just does not seem to have the qualifications.",
      "And then on top of that, you look at his personal conduct, especially when he was managing Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans of America. You know, these two organizations were financially mismanaged. There was reports of being intoxicated on the job and creating an environment, you know, where there was, you know, some issues with, you know, sexual harassment.",
      "So, I think it's in the nominee, Mr. Hegseth's best interests, if he wants to be confirmed for this job, for us to have all the information. You know, the information from these organizations, but also the FBI background check. Right now, as you say, the chairman and the ranking member are going to get it. That's an agreement with the White House.",
      "But there has been exceptions made in the past for certain nominees. This clearly - because it is bipartisan. Like a - you know, across the aisle, folks want to see the FBI background check. I think we should get an opportunity to take a look at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting that your - that the ranking member had been briefed as of Friday. Are - you're saying no information has been shared?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Do you think it will be before Tuesday when the hearing -",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Not yet. I don't know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think, you know, we will have an opportunity. You know, I'll talk to the ranking member. And I also talked to the chairman about this, about his nomination in general. More so the discussion I had with Roger Wicker was about just meeting with Mr. Hegseth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Y Es.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: We've reached out to him multiple times, have not been able to schedule a meeting in my office, and he's not meeting with any other Democrats on the committee other than the ranking member.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: More information is better. If - if he wants to be confirmed for this job -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think it's in our best interest to have everything put out on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Intelligence Committee. Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, she is controversial as well. Republican Senator Capito was on Fox today and said, when she privately met with Tulsi Gabbard, she pressed her on that 2017 trip to Syria that came in the wake of a chemical weapons attack carried out by dictator Bashar al Assad against civilians. Gabbard told her, she said, that she didn't even know she was going to Syria, that she intended to go to Lebanon on the scheduled visit and ended up in Syria. Is that a credible answer?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I talked to Congresswoman Gabbard this week, met with her in my office. We talked about the trip to Syria. She didn't tell me that part. I mean I think it's kind of unusual that you wind up in one place that wasn't part of the plan.",
      "But what concerns me more, especially about that trip, is, it was common knowledge that Assad was gassing the civilian population, using chemical weapons against the population multiple times. And she didn't argue about those. But she took the time and the effort to make a case that there were two cases. And she used, you know, experts that were not credible to try to - try to prove that he was not using chemical weapons in those two instances.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I have a hard time understanding why you would want to do that, to use your political capital to try to prove something when there are multiple cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And, you know, on top of that, when you look at, you know, what's - what, in Russia, with misinformation -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: She does seem to have a predilection for misinformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And for not having -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Presenting a case that isn't strong and not listening to the intelligence community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: My producer is yelling in my ear. I've got to go. Senator, I'm so sorry to cut you off.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we will see when the hearing gets scheduled.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: All right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Naples, Florida, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has a new documentary airing on PBS \"Coming to America.\" It examines how nine remarkable American immigrants have shaped our country's history.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH (Former U.S. House Speaker): Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this documentary, you tell the stories of these individuals who immigrated to the U.S. And they were very successful people, like Albert Einstein.",
      "You know, when you look at Einstein and you look at Henry Kissinger, they were refugees to this country. Donald Trump set refugee admissions at very low levels first term. He's talking about block refugee admissions this term. Is that a mistake?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think - I think we're going through a period of, frankly, reacting to an extraordinarily disastrous immigration policy, so you're going to have some twists and turns. In the long run, we do want to have an ability to allow legitimate refugees to come here. We also, and part of the reason Callista and I made this documentary for PBS is, we really believe strongly that legal immigrants are a major contribution to America's success and to its exceptional nature. And we want to make sure that, you know, as many Americans favor legal immigration as oppose to illegal immigration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: It's very important to distinguish the two. And we want to strongly communicate that legal immigration in a variety of forms, refugees is one, another is various work permits, but we want people to be able to come to America if they do so legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said immigrants inhabit the very soul of what it is to be an American. When you say legitimate refugees, what do you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think people can stand up and say, I have now decided I'm a refugee, I feel threatened. The question is, is it true or not? Are they really threatened? Or, in fact, is that just their way of getting into the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Claim asylum, you mean?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: To claim asylum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're -",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: I think there's a big - there's a big difference between somebody who genuinely faces a potential loss of life or freedom and somebody who simply wants to come to America and decides to claim that status.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic migrants there.",
      "Let me ask you, someone else you feature in here, Zalmay Khalilzad, a very prominent Afghan American who brokered Trump's deal with the Taliban to exit Afghanistan. As you know with that chaotic exit, there were tens of thousands of Afghans scattered, some of them still separated from their families. Many of them worked for the U.S. government.",
      "Should Mr. Trump extend the legal process of this program and bring those Afghans here? And would you ask Congress to raise the current cap they have on the number of them coming?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: You know, I think the Afghan refugees who actively fought on the side of Americans, saved American lives, tried to help win against the Taliban, I think they deserve an unusual level of support and treatment. And I worked all during the period of President Biden's insanely disastrous withdrawal. I tried to work with various people and did podcasts with people who were trying to get folks out of Afghanistan who should legitimately have been helped by the U.S. government.",
      "So, you know, when somebody's totally your ally, and this happened with the Vietnamese in the Vietnamese war. When somebody's totally your ally and they risk their lives side-by-side with you, you shouldn't abandon them. All right, that's a pretty straightforward rule.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things the Biden administration blamed the Trump administration for was the difficulty in making those fast arrangements to bring those Afghans here. And that's a story for another day. But the person they put their finger on as making it more difficult is Steven Miller, who is now the top policy adviser to Mr. Trump. He did add new requirements to visas, other things that made it harder to legally come here. Have you spoken to him about some of your concerns?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: No. I know Steven very well.",
      "Look, so Steven was responding to a disastrous level of immigration that's not sustainable. And I think that's - I think virtually every American agrees, you can't have an open border, you can't have Venezuelan gangs, for example, or El Salvadorans gangs. I mean there are a lot of good reasons. And you're going to get some overreaction, but it's an overreaction, frankly, caused by people like President Biden who were totally irresponsible in allowing people into this country by the millions in a way that was totally illegal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: I mean it was outside the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Pardon me, I don't know if our viewers heard that there was an alarm that went off here so it interrupted some of what you said there.",
      "Donald Trump has chosen your wife, Callista, who helped make this documentary with you, to be the next ambassador to Switzerland. Are you advising the president-elect in any capacity right now?",

      "A Los Angeles-based company that owns more than a dozen hospitals in four states filed for bankruptcy late Saturday night, the second major system acquired by private equity to collapse in less than a year.",
      "In an initial filing seeking Chapter 11 protections, Prospect Medical Holdings, which owns facilities in California, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, listed debts of more than $400 million. In a press release announcing its restructuring, the company said it would continue to operate as normal.",
      "\"Throughout the Chapter 11 process, Prospect Holdings' hospitals, medical centers, and physicians' offices will remain open, and patient care and services will continue uninterrupted,\" the company wrote.",
      "Prospect Medical's bankruptcy comes less than a year after the bankruptcy of Steward Health Care, another major hospital system once-backed by private equity.\u00a0 CBS News documented how Steward, along with private equity investors, extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from that company, potentially leading to\u00a0shortages of life-saving medical equipment.",
      "Along with Steward, Prospect Medical has been one focus of an ongoing CBS News investigation revealing how private equity investors have siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars from community hospitals with devastating public health consequences.",
      "From 2010 to 2021, private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners controlled a majority stake in Prospect Medical. CBS News has reported on a series of financial moves the company took to issue leadership a $457 million dividend in 2018. Prospect Medical's CEO Sam Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid $257 million.",
      "Among the similarities between Prospect Medical and Steward, both of them relied on the value of their hospital real estate to help finance large payouts for their owners. The transactions resulted in onerous lease agreements that diverted funds away from direct patient care.",
      "Last week, a powerful, bipartisan Senate committee found what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" as Leonard Green and Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, causing hospitals serving vulnerable communities to cut services or close altogether. The Senate committee's findings were part of a 162-page report report that concluded private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "Both Prospect Medical and Leonard Green disputed the findings by Senate investigators.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",

Before a confirmation vote in the Senate, Gabbard must appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which must receive paperwork for nominees at least a week before the scheduled hearing.",
      "Gabbard served in the Army National Guard and represented Hawaii in the House as a Democrat from 2013 to 2021.

    "story": [
      "Rep. Judy Chu, who represents areas that were devastated by the Los Angeles wildfires, said fire agencies have assured her there is \"enough water\" to continue fighting fires amid concerns over water pressure in the area.",
      "Chu, a California Democrat whose district includes the area of Altadena that was decimated by the Eaton Fire, explained on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that when the fires first started amid \"drastic winds,\" fire departments were overwhelmed.",
      "\"This is not an ordinary incident, and many fire hydrants were going on at the same time, and also the electricity used to pump the water had been turned off so that there would not spark anymore fire,\" Chu said. \"So that happened at that point, but I believe that we're in a good place right now.\"",
      "Officials said the wildfires ripping through communities in Los Angeles in recent days have killed at least 16 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures, and displaced thousands. And the high winds are expected to pick up again this week. Meanwhile, questions are swirling around how Californians can rebuild when the wildfires cease.",
      "\"These communities have to be rebuilt,\" Chu said. \"I have the beautiful areas of Altadena and Pasadena and these were vibrant communities, diverse communities with so much historic value behind them. People love these areas, and we need to make sure that there are the resources possible for them to rebuild their homes, as well as the incredible small businesses that are here.\"",
      "Chu, who toured the devastation with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell in recent days and said she arranged for other members of California's congressional delegation to see the damage as well, urged that \"we need to make sure that Congress is ready to provide the help that's needed to rebuild these areas like Altadena and Pasadena.\"",
      "The California Democrats said there are plans to invite House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as President-elect Donald Trump, to visit the area to see the damage firsthand, adding that Republicans in Congress have expressed that \"they are very open to coming and seeing what is going on.\"",
      "\"These wildfires don't have any political affiliation,\" Chu said. \"They don't belong to any political party. This devastation has affected thousands upon thousands of people who just ran out of their homes with nothing in their hands and are trying to rebuild, and they need help.\"",
      "Chu urged people who have been affected by the fires to sign up on disasterassistance.gov\u00a0to kickstart the relief process, noting that they must have their insurance information available. She also said FEMA has temporary locations open in the area and will be opening a local assistance center on Tuesday.",
      "Still, Chu stressed that her community \"is not out of the danger zone,\" with winds expected to pick up early this week.",
      "\"They will be around 50 miles per hour. That is less than what caused this whole terrible catastrophe,\" Chu said. \"Nonetheless, they could spread the fire. And I urge all residents to pay attention to the evacuation warnings and orders, and most of all to make sure that they are safe.\"",
      "This is\u00a0how to help victims\u00a0of the Los Angeles wildfire victims.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Sunday that L.A. officials were \"very prepared\" for devastating wildfires, noting that the area is prone to fires. But \"they have never seen 100-mile-an-hour winds that are fueling the fire,\" she said.",
      "\"Those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days,\" Criswell said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Communities in Los Angeles have been engulfed in wildfires in recent days, which have killed at least 16 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures, and displaced thousands, officials said. The high winds that fanned flames in recent days are expected to pick up again this week.",
      "The FEMA administrator said she doesn't have any information on the cause of the wildfires at this time, though she noted that will be investigated. She urged as the winds are expected to return, she wants people to \"make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying\" to stay out of harm's way.",
      "When it comes to rebuilding, Criswell said insurance is a \"real concern,\" citing reports of Californians losing their coverage before the fires. She said insurance is the \"number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process.\"",
      "Criswell noted that FEMA programs are in place to \"help jump start the recovery process,\" not replace insurance. But she said without insurance, \"families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild.\"",
      "The maximum FEMA grant level is under $44,000. Criswell acknowledged that in many places, including California, the amount isn't enough to rebuild a home. She pledged that FEMA will work with its partners, including the Small Business Administration, which can provide low-interest loans to families, along with nonprofit and philanthropic partners to help affected families rebuild.",
      "The FEMA administrator also noted that \"it's not necessarily just where you rebuild, it's going to be how.\" Criswell said that the agency wants to encourage families to rebuild their homes to make them more fire resistant, noting that \"that's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.\"",
      "\"We want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there,\" Criswell said. \"We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.\"",
      "As part of building more resilient communities, Criswell also encouraged moving power lines underground, which in addition to reducing the possibility of causing wildfires also allows officials to keep power on during severe weather events.",
      "Criswell didn't provide an overarching figure for the total cost of the damage in Los Angeles, noting that the fires are still burning and damage is still occurring. But she urged that there are other programs Congress can work through to cover some of the damage, saying there's \"a wide variety of different tools and resources\" lawmakers can authorize \"to really help this community on this road to recovery.\"",

    "summary": "An investigation is underway into an unauthorized drone that hit a firefighting aircraft while it battled raging wildfires in Los Angeles last week.",
    "story": [
      "An investigation is underway to find the operator of a private drone that collided with a firefighting aircraft battling the blazes in Los Angeles on Thursday, the FBI said.",
      "The unauthorized drone damaged the aircraft, known as a \"super scooper,\" as it was working to suppress the massive Palisades Fire that has so far engulfed more than 23,000 acres of land in western L.A. County.",
      "Laura Eimiller, a spokesperson for the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said in a statement to CBS News on Sunday that the drone violated temporary flight restrictions enacted by the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of the blazes.",
      "The restrictions are set to remain in place through Jan. 25 and currently apply to areas around the Palisades Fire and Eaton Fire, which has scorched at least 14,000 acres as of Sunday. Providing \"a safe environment for firefighting aviation operations\" is the purpose of those temporary orders, the FAA said.",
      "The super scooper was able to land safely after being hit on Thursday, said Eimiller, although the drone left a 3-by-6-inch hole in the aircraft's left wing. Authorities were able to recover parts of the drone, which was \"heavily damaged,\" after it crashed.",
      "\"While we have conducted a significant investigation working with our partners, we are seeking the public's help in order to identify the operator of the drone,\" Eimiller said.",

      "California state officials said there have been at least 40 incidents where unauthorized drones have forced firefighters to pause air operations since the wildfires broke out last week. Crews battling the blazes have used air tankers to dump thousands of gallons of flame retardant, and super scoopers, as well as helicopters, to drop water over the blazes.",
      "\"When people fly drones near wildfires, fire response agencies often ground their aircraft to avoid the potential for a midair collision,\" the FAA writes on its website. \"Delaying airborne response poses a threat to firefighters on the ground, residents, and property in nearby communities, and it can allow wildfires to grow larger.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:51:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The first congestion pricing plan in the U.S. has begun, charging most drivers $9 a day to enter the lower half of Manhattan. The long-debated plan is projected to raise up to $800 million a year for the city's aging public transit system. Will it work?",
    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",
      "Fourteen hundred cameras keep tabs on the roughly 150,000 commuters entering the zone by car.",
      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",
      "New Jersey drivers were none too happy; they already pay more than $15 in bridge and tunnel tolls to get into the city.",
      "Singapore began congestion pricing in 1975, and Stockholm in 2006. But New York based its plan on London's, which rolled out in 2003.",
      "Opponents in New York say this is just a cash grab \u2013 another tax that will hurt mainly working people.",
      "Congestion pricing in New York City starts after years of turmoil and legal challengesWhat to know about New York City's new congestion pricing program\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",

      "What to know about New York City's new congestion pricing program",
      "\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",
      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here. And I think having New York be a more productive city, I think he'll appreciate it.\"",

    "summary": "As President Biden gets ready to leave office, he will give a speech Monday defining his foreign policy legacy.",
    "story": [
      "With a world at war in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, President Biden is set to talk about his foreign policy legacy on Monday at the State Department in a speech expected to focus on his administration's investment in strong global alliances and his attempt to reclaim  America's leadership role in the world.",
      "When Mr. Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for a change with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue U.S. outreach to the world is what will safeguard American interests \u2014 not isolationism.",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",

Reuters also reported that officials from the Biden administration were believed to have participated.",
      "\"The next 24 hours will be pivotal to reaching the deal,\" the official told Reuters.",
      "\"We are not there yet but there is a potential for real progress,\" an official close to the talks told CBS News.",
      "What has been happening with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks?",
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of militant-held hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "On Sunday, President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone about the ongoing negotiations. The White House said the two leaders discussed the deal based on the arrangement outlined by Mr. Biden last year. The Biden administration has been pushing for a deal before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "But despite intense mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues including the details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "As each side has accused the other of backtracking, the war has ground on.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed each day in Israeli strikes, and most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are huddled in squalid tent camps, their neighborhoods in ruins. Humanitarian groups struggle to deliver desperately needed aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "In Israel, families of the hostages have held weekly rallies demanding a deal for their release, fearing their loved ones will die in the harsh conditions of their captivity the longer the fighting drags on.",
      "What have the main points of contention been in coming up with a ceasefire deal?",
      "Hamas and other groups are still holding around 100 hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The Israeli military has declared a third of the hostages dead but suspects that the true number could be around half.",
      "Hamas is demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed civilians. Israel is reluctant to free such prisoners, especially since one of the masterminds of the 2023 attack, the slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, was a former prisoner released in such a deal.",
      "The two sides have exchanged lists of names, with Israel demanding more information about which hostages are alive to ensure they come out first. Hamas says it needs at least a brief truce to determine the status of the hostages because they are being held by various groups in scattered, secret locations.",
      "The emerging deal calls for a multiphase plan. In the first stage, Hamas would release the most vulnerable hostages and Israeli forces would pull back from some areas, allowing some Palestinians to return to their homes and a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "In the second step - which would be negotiated during the first - the rest of the living hostages would be released in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages without assurances that the war will end. Israel's offensive has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Hamas likely fears that Israel will resume its offensive - and step up its intensity - once the hostages are out and the militants no longer have their most valuable bargaining chip.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do just that. He says Israel won't end the war until it has destroyed Hamas' military and governing abilities and ensured that the Palestinian militant group no longer poses a threat.",
      "The lack of trust goes both ways: Israelis fear that Hamas will drag out negotiations over the second phase, extending the ceasefire indefinitely while the hostages languish.",
      "Talks have almost collapsed over disagreements",
      "The talks nearly collapsed last summer when Netanyahu said Israel would maintain a lasting presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.",
      "Israel says Hamas has long smuggled weapons into Gaza through tunnels beneath the corridor and that it must control the area to prevent Hamas from rebuilding. Egypt, a key mediator, says it blocked the tunnels years ago and is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border.",
      "Israel has also demanded a mechanism for inspecting people returning to their homes in northern Gaza, from which around a million people fled following Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war. Their return is a key Hamas demand, the details of which are still being worked out.",
      "Israel says people returning to the north should be searched for weapons. That would probably require an Israeli presence in what's known as the Netzarim corridor, a strip of closed roads and military installations stretching from the border to the sea just south of Gaza City.",
      "The Palestinians are opposed to any permanent Israeli occupation, though Hamas has reportedly shown flexibility on the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Israel says Hamas can never again rule Gaza but has yet to endorse a realistic plan for an \u00a0 alternative government. With no internal rivals, Hamas has been able to quickly regroup after Israeli operations, even in the hardest-hit areas, and still controls much of the territory.",
      "The Biden administration has long pushed for a grand bargain in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern postwar Gaza with the support of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which would also take the historic step of forging ties with Israel.",
      "But Arab and Muslim leaders say they will only sign onto such plans if they include a pathway to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Netanyahu says Israel will maintain open-ended security control while delegating governance to politically independent Palestinians. But none appear to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel in running the territory.",
      "Hamas has said, however, that it's willing to relinquish control of Gaza to other Palestinians. Late last year, it agreed to an Egyptian-brokered plan for a group of independents to govern the territory under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has yet to accept the proposal.",
      "Hamas has also demanded the lifting of a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after it seized power in 2007, which experts say is needed for Gaza to be rebuilt.",
      "The lifting of the blockade, however, would allow Hamas to claim a major victory and to eventually rebuild its military capabilities. That's another nonstarter for Israel."

    "summary": "After traveling more than a million miles on the job, the secretary of state discusses the Biden administration's foreign policy report card, from a reinvigorated NATO alliance and Russian aggression in Ukraine, to the ongoing turmoil in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "No easy stroll to the exit for Antony Blinken. With exactly eight days left as secretary of state, he's only just concluded what is likely his last trip back-and-forth across the globe, with meetings in Seoul, Tokyo, Paris and, finally, Rome.",
      "Blinken has traveled more than a million miles on the job. \"Every minute, every hour, every day of the time that we have left, we're focused on getting results,\" he said.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" flew with him in early December \u2013 three trips ago \u2013 from Washington to Brussels for the most recent NATO foreign ministers meeting. The main topic of discussion was Russian aggression in Ukraine.",
      "\"We have a new NATO strategic concept,\" said Blinken. \"It recognizes Russia as the most direct threat to the alliance.\"",
      "But there was a lot of well-wishing going on as well. Blinken stood right in the middle of the so-called \"family photo,\" and also photo-bombed a portrait of all the women foreign ministers.",
      "Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the secretary-general of NATO, told Blinken, \"You have been a staunch ally, and people like you very much.\"",
      "All this ceremonial show & tell might be seen as subtle messaging to the incoming Trump administration about the value of nurturing alliance \u2013 the \"stronger together\" argument. Blinken said, \"The instruction I got from President Biden on Day One was, get in there, rejuvenate, re-energize, and even re-imagine our alliances and partnerships.\"",
      "Here was one more chance for Blinken to hold up the Biden administration foreign policy report card \u2026 and his own. He explained, \"If the United States is not engaged, if we're not leading, then probably either someone else is (and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and our values), or maybe just as bad, no one is. What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"",
      "As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"",
      "President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"",
      "Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state.\u00a0 His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\"",
      "Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden.",
      "Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"",
      "It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\"",
      "Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.",
      "On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"",
      "Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\"",
      "And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\"",
      "He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie:",
      "What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\"",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved sending the director of the Mossad foreign intelligence agency to ceasefire negotiations in Qatar in a sign of progress in talks on the\u00a0war in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu's office announced the decision Saturday evening, local time. It was not immediately clear when David Barnea would travel to Qatar's capital, Doha, for the latest round of indirect talks between Israel and the Hamas militant group. His presence means high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are now involved.",
      "Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved in 15 months of war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. The talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly stalled since then.",
      "Netanyahu has insisted on destroying Hamas' ability to fight in Gaza. Hamas has insisted on a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the largely devastated territory. On Thursday, Gaza's Health Ministry said over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war.",
      "Also being sent to Qatar are the head of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency and military and political advisers. Netanyahu's office said the decision followed a meeting with his defense minister, security chiefs and negotiators \"on behalf of the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations.\"",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week a deal is \"very close\" and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration. But U.S. officials have expressed similar optimism on several occasions over the past year.",

      "Hamas and other groups killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages into Gaza in the attack that started the war. A truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year.",
      "On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians including two children and two women in a school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza, according to the Civil Defense, first responders affiliated with the Hamas-run government.

Trump said that it was a matter of national security for the U.S. Melting sea ice has\u00a0opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic, and Western powers have\u00a0already voiced concern about\u00a0Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",

      "U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk had been working to hammer out the technical details of a proposal, but Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea did not fly to Doha this week as Israeli media had said he might, and there was no indication that CIA chief William Burns was in Qatar, either. Both men have joined the talks repeatedly when there's been hope of a potential agreement.",
      "One apparent sticking point in the talks has been the unconfirmed condition of 34 Israeli hostages in Gaza who were listed on a document that Hamas resurfaced this week after it first emerged last summer. Israel has demanded to know who on the list is still alive and who is dead. Hamas demanded a four-day ceasefire to contact its network of militants across Gaza to confirm the hostages' condition, saying Israel's ongoing operations made it impossible for the group to assess otherwise.",
      "Family members and friends of the hostages have protested regularly in Israel to demand that Netanyahu's government strike a deal to bring them all home at the same time. Israeli officials believe about 100 hostages are still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza, though at least 30 are believed to be dead.",
      "If a ceasefire does take shape, the first phase would involve a swap of hostages for Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, along with a surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza.",
      "But another major hurdle is Hamas' consistent demand that Israeli forces completely withdraw from the Gaza Strip \u2014 something Israel has thus far refused to accept.",
      "Some Israelis and Palestinians hope for \"help from Donald Trump\"",
      "If a deal is not achieved by President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, some Israelis \u2014 and Palestinians \u2014 hope he will bring a needed change to the negotiations, potentially for the better.",
      "\"He is unpredictable and he is brave,\" Ilay David, brother of 24-year-old hostage Eyvatar David, told CBS News at a rally in Jerusalem on Friday afternoon. \"We have to think out of the box, and Trump can bring that change.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump is known for being mostly a businessman,\" said 19-year-old Palestinian cybersecurity student Ameen Abu Fkheida at Birzeit University in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \"I don't think he will be a friend [of Palestinians], but I do think there will be some sort of help from Donald Trump regarding the case of Gaza, which could probably be a ceasefire or an exchange of prisoners or something to deescalate the current situation in Gaza.\"",

The Hisbah, a regional police force tasked with enforcing Islamic Sharia law, have carried out midnight raids on motor parks, markets and street corners in the regional capital, Kano, since the beginning of the year, evacuating children as they sleep.",
      "\"We have so far mopped up 300 of these boys from the streets and taken them into a camp provided for their rehabilitation,\" Hisbah's director-general Abba Sufi told AFP. \"Their continued living on the streets is a huge social and security threat because they are potential criminal recruits.\"",
      "\"They are a ticking time bomb that needs to be urgently defused with tact and care,\" said Sufi.",

      "Officials told AFP that many of the children in Kano city came from neighboring states.",
      "\"Some of them are from Kano, while others are from other states,\" said Hisbah commander Aminu Daurawa. \"The first step is profiling them and identifying where they came from.\"",
      "Some were sent from villages to learn how to read the Koran at informal Islamic religious schools called almajiri. Residents said many students of the Koranic schools beg for food and alms between classes.",
      "Attempts by authorities and local groups to intervene and support the age-old almajiri system have faced opposition from traditional clerics.",
      "The Hisbah police plan to provide \"psychosocial\" support and counselling to the children before enrolling those who show interest in school, Sufi said, adding that others will be given seed money to start a trade of their choice.",
      "Daurawa told AFP that out-of-state children will be repatriated after their rehabilitation.",
      "Previous attempts to clear the city of street children have failed.",
      "Between 2017 and 2018, the Hisbah evacuated some 26,000 children and reunited them with their parents in and outside Kano, but they returned to the streets after a lull, according to Daurawa.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities in Kano shut almajiri schools and transported the pupils to their states, but they returned when the schools reopened.",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:52:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Two new studies suggest once again the importance of getting a good night&apos;s sleep for good health over a lifetime, as scientists pursue new understandings of restorative deep sleep.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Wendy Troxel, a sleep therapist in Utah, discusses a study that found small bouts of light exercise in the evening can help promote more restful sleep.",
      "It might be worth working a little bit harder to get that much-desired, but often elusive, good night's sleep.",
      "Deep sleep clears the mind of waste just as a \"dishwasher\" cleans dirty plates and glasses, just-published research suggests \u2014 and there's more.",
      "The findings also offer insights into how sleeping pills may disrupt the \"brainwashing\" system \u2014 potentially affecting cognitive function for people over the long run.",
      "ANOTHER REASON TO GET MORE SLEEP AND THIS ONE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU",
      "Study senior author professor Maiken Nedergaard of the University of Rochester and the University of Copenhagen said norepinephrine (a neurotransmitter and hormone) triggers blood vessels to contract \u2014 generating slow pulsations that create a rhythmic flow in the surrounding fluid to carry away waste, news agency SWNS noted.",
      "Said Nedergaard, \"It's like turning on the dishwasher before you go to bed and waking up with a clean brain. . . . We're essentially asking what drives this process and trying to define restorative sleep based on\" this \"glymphatic clearance.\"",
      "\"It's like turning on the dishwasher before you go to bed and waking up with a clean brain.\" (iStock)",
      "The brain has a built-in waste removal process - the glymphatic system - that circulates fluid in the brain and spinal cord to clear out waste, according to the scientists.",
      "The process helps remove toxic proteins that form sticky plaques linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.",
      "But the scientists indicated that what drives the system was unclear until now, according to the study.",
      "Is all sleep created equal? The researchers wanted to find out.",
      "To find clues, Nedergaard and her team looked into what happens in mice when their brains sleep, as SWNS reported of the study. The team focused on the relationship between norepinephrine and blood flow during deep sleep.",
      "TRUMP'S DAYLIGHT SAVING PLAN AND SLEEP: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW",
      "They found that norepinephrine waves correlate to variations in brain blood volume \u2014 suggesting that norepinephrine triggers a rhythmic pulsation in the blood vessels. The researchers then compared the changes in blood volume to brain fluid flow.",
      "The brain fluid flow fluctuates in correspondence to blood volume changes, suggesting the vessels act as pumps to propel the surrounding brain fluid to flush out waste.",
      "During deep sleep, toxic proteins that form sticky plaques linked to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are removed, scientists say in a new study.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Natalie Hauglund of the University of Copenhagen and the University of Oxford, the study's lead author, said, \"You can view norepinephrine as [the] conductor of an orchestra.\"",
      "She added, \"There's a harmony in the constriction and dilation of the arteries, which then drives the cerebrospinal fluid through the brain to remove the waste products.\"",

      "Hauglund said she wanted to understand whether all sleep is created equal.",
      "To find out, the research team administered zolpidem, a common drug to aid sleep, to mice.",
      "\"If people aren't getting the full benefits of sleep, they should be aware of that, so they can make informed decisions.\"",
      "They found that the norepinephrine waves during deep sleep were 50% lower in zolpidem-treated mice than in naturally sleeping mice.",
      "Although the zolpidem-treated mice fell asleep more quickly \u2014 fluid transport into the brain dropped more than 30%, as SWNS reported.",
      "Two new studies indicate the importance of getting a good night's sleep \u2014 with one study saying a lack of sleep may be sabotaging the brain\u2019s ability to keep intrusive thoughts at bay. (iStock)",
      "The researchers say their findings, published in the journal Cell, suggest that the sleeping aid may disrupt the norepinephrine-driven waste clearance during sleep.",
      "Hauglund said, \"More and more people are using sleep medication, and it's really important to know if that's healthy sleep. If people aren't getting the full benefits of sleep, they should be aware of that, so they can make informed decisions.\"",

      "The research team said the findings likely apply to humans, who also have a glymphatic system, although it requires further testing.",

      "HEART ATTACK RISK COULD RISE WITH ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER CONSUMPTION, STUDY FINDS",

      "Sugary drinks are rapidly digested, causing a spike in blood sugar levels with little nutritional value.",
      "Sugary drinks cause blood sugar to spike because they are \"rapidly digested,\" the research team said.",
      "When consumed on a long-term basis, these types of beverages, in addition to increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, may also lead to weight gain and insulin resistance, the researchers added.",
      "Men are more likely than women to suffer the consequences of sugary drink consumption, as are younger adults compared to their older counterparts, a new study asserts. (iStock)",
      "Professor Dariush Mozaffarian, the study's senior author, said in a university press release, \"Sugar-sweetened beverages are heavily marketed and sold in low- and middle-income nations.\"",

      "New Jersey-based registered dietitian Erin Palinski-Wade, who was not involved in the research, said the findings were to be expected, as diets rich in added sugars are more likely to increase the risk of chronic health conditions, including type 2 diabetes.",
      "When consumed on a long-term basis, these types of beverages can also lead to weight gain and insulin resistance, experts say. (iStock)",

      "\"This definition excluded 100% fruit and vegetable juices, noncaloric artificially sweetened drinks, and sweetened milk,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"This was an observational study, not a causation study, and shows only an association between diets containing sugar-sweetened beverages and diabetes,\" she noted.",

      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned in a recent advisory about alcohol use increasing cancer risk.",

      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",
      "He also suggested joining a support group, \"like Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery or Women for Sobriety.\"",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

      "7. Relationship challenges",
      "\"Many adults with ADHD have difficulty maintaining relationships with others due to inappropriate social behaviors, such as frequently interrupting, losing interest in conversations, difficulty paying attention and forgetfulness,\" Kahn noted.",
      "\"You might forget to call friends back or forget about commitments to others, which can cause issues in your relationships.\"",

Starting with diesel engines, the first two versions of the Starship made impressive strides in fuel efficiency, but now with the introduction of the Starship 3.0, we're witnessing a remarkable shift towards sustainability. This latest iteration features the innovative Cummins X15N natural gas engine, which not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces emissions.",

The first two versions of the Starship were powered by diesel engines, achieving notable fuel efficiencies compared to industry standards. However, the introduction of the Cummins X15N natural gas engine in the Starship 3.0 represents a pivotal shift away from diesel, addressing both environmental concerns and operational efficiency.",
      "The X15N engine, launched in 2024, is designed specifically for heavy-duty applications and overcomes previous limitations associated with natural gas as a fuel source. It provides similar power outputs to diesel engines but does so with enhanced fuel efficiency and significantly lower emissions.

This adaptability not only enhances its eco-friendliness but also positions it as a practical option for fleets looking to transition away from traditional fuels.",
      "Weight reduction: The new engine is approximately 500 pounds lighter than its diesel counterpart, which increases the potential freight-carrying capacity of the truck. This weight reduction is complemented by other lightweight materials used in the truck's construction, contributing to an impressive ton-miles per gallon efficiency of 183, compared to an industry average of 72.",

The truck uses Shell Rotella NG Plus SAE 5W-30 synthetic oil, formulated specifically for this purpose, alongside advanced transmission lubricants that improve overall performance.",

    "summary": "PowerSchool, which serves over 60 million students and teachers globally, has become the latest target of cybercriminals. Millions of records were stolen.",
    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Cybercriminals spare no industry, targeting sectors like health care, insurance, automotive and education. Health care has been a frequent target, with attacks like the Ascension breach last year and the CVR incident in late 2024.",
      "Now, education technology giant PowerSchool has become the latest target, with records of millions of students and teachers stolen.",
      "While the exact number of affected individuals remains unknown, the scale of the breach is alarming.",
      "PowerSchool serves 18,000 customers worldwide, including schools in the U.S. and Canada, managing grading, attendance and personal information for over 60 million K-12 students and teachers.",

      "Kids working on their laptops\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How did hackers target PowerSchool",
      "PowerSchool revealed a cybersecurity breach to its customers Jan. 7, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. The company said it discovered the breach Dec. 28, after customer data from its PowerSchool SIS platform was stolen through the PowerSource support portal.",
      "PowerSchool SIS is a student information system used for managing grades, attendance, enrollment and other student records. Hackers accessed the PowerSource portal using stolen credentials and used an \"export data manager\" tool to steal information.",
      "The company said this wasn\u2019t a ransomware attack or a result of software flaws, but rather a straightforward network break-in. The company has hired a third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the breach, figure out what happened and determine who was affected.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "UNDERSTANDING BRUSHING SCAMS AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "What data got stolen",
      "The PowerSource portal includes a feature that allows PowerSchool engineers to access customer systems for support and troubleshooting. The attacker exploited this feature to export the PowerSchool SIS \"students\" and \"teachers\" database tables to a CSV file, which was then stolen.",
      "PowerSchool confirmed the stolen data primarily includes contact details like names and addresses. However, for some districts, the data may also include sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, personally identifiable information, medical records and grades.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The company said customer support tickets, credentials and forum data were not accessed or stolen during the breach. PowerSchool also emphasized that not all SIS customers were affected and expects only a subset of customers will need to notify those affected.",
      "\"We do not anticipate the data being shared or made public, and we believe it has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination,\" the developer told customers in a notice.",
      "\"We have also deactivated the compromised credential and restricted all access to the affected portal. Lastly, we have conducted a full password reset and further tightened password and access control for all PowerSource customer support portal accounts.\"",
      "PowerSchool said affected adults will be offered free credit monitoring, while minors will receive subscriptions to an unspecified identity protection service.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from PowerSchool data breach",
      "The PowerSchool data breach has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant about your personal information. Here are five steps you can take to protect yourself:",
      "1. Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and any online services linked to your personal information. Watch for unauthorized transactions or changes to your accounts that could signal misuse of your data.",
      "2. Freeze your credit: If your Social Security number or other sensitive details were compromised, consider placing a credit freeze with major credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This prevents potential identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "3. Use identity theft protection services:\u00a0Take advantage of any identity protection services offered by PowerSchool as part of its breach response. These services can alert you to suspicious activity and provide support if your identity is stolen.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One of the best parts of some identity protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Wherever possible, enable\u00a02FA for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text code or app-generated token, to access your accounts.",
      "5. Be aware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software: Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to exploit data breaches. Avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or text messages, especially those claiming to be from PowerSchool or your school district.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You can blame hackers for this breach, but PowerSchool shares the responsibility for failing to adequately protect sensitive data. The company may also be in violation of data privacy agreements it signed with school districts, as well as federal and state laws designed to safeguard student privacy. What\u2019s more concerning is that PowerSchool took nearly two weeks to notify its customers about the breach. Schools are now left scrambling to assess the full extent of the intrusion. This delay is not just irresponsible; it puts students, parents and teachers at heightened risk of cyberattacks and identity theft.",

Once installed, it downloads the FireScam malware onto your device and starts stealing your personal data.",

      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Such apps can\u2019t be distributed through legitimate app stores like the Play Store or the App Store, so they rely on third-party stores and fake websites to spread.

      "Floating solar still process (Dalhousie University)",
      "The power of plasmonic solar stills",
      "At the heart of this innovation is a floating solar still, a device that harnesses the sun's energy to purify seawater.",
      "Dr. Mita Dasog, an associate professor of chemistry and Killam Memorial chair at Dalhousie, explains the science behind it: \"Refractory plasmonic nanomaterials are very good at capturing light and converting that light into heat.\"",
      "This principle forms the foundation of their ingenious design. The solar still, conceptualized by Dr. Matthew Margeson during his Ph.D. studies, addresses challenges that have long plagued similar devices. It minimizes thermal losses, prevents salt buildup and can withstand harsh maritime conditions.",
      "Researcher pictured next to floating solar still (Matthew J. Margeson)",
      "A BREAKTHROUGH GADGET COULD HELP YOU DETECT MICROPLASTICS IN YOUR DRINKING WATER",
      "How it works",
      "The floating solar still operates through an elegantly simple yet highly effective process. First, ocean water is drawn up to the device's foam surface through a wicking system. Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

      "What sets this device apart is its use of unconventional materials. Instead of relying on expensive precious metals, the team turned to an unlikely source: used tires. Through a process called pyrolysis, carbon waste from tires is transformed into a crucial component of the desalination unit.",
      "Dr. Dasog emphasizes the importance of accessibility: \"We shouldn't be making an expensive or very complicated device. It has to be easy to manufacture, last for a long time and be easy to take apart and move.\" This approach not only makes the technology more affordable but also addresses the environmental issue of tire waste.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat.",
      "With our lives so intertwined with digital communication these days, the threat of email fraud is something we all need to take seriously. Recently, Teresa W. shared a scary experience that underscores the dangers of business email compromise (BEC).",
      "\"I almost lost many thousands of dollars through an internet fraud scam. I got a call from our personal banker who said she saw nearly all the money in our business account being withdrawn. She said she got an email from me along with the money wiring directions. I told her I didn't send that and she said my email came from me directly to her. I said to stop everything and I will get to the bottom of it.",
      "\"Apparently the thieves got hold of a wiring instruction paper from my email, which they hacked into. They created a rule in Outlook to bypass me if anything came from them and go straight to the banker. They changed the wiring instructions to go into their account but thank goodness our banker alerted me so I could get to the bottom of it. Too close for comfort!\"",
      "This incident highlights a sophisticated scam where cybercriminals gain access to legitimate email accounts and use them to deceive others into transferring funds. Teresa\u2019s quick action, combined with her banker's vigilance, prevented a significant financial loss, but it serves as a wake-up call for many businesses.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How the scam works",
      "Email hacking: Scammers often gain access to email accounts through\u00a0phishing attacks, where they trick users into revealing their login credentials or by deploying malware that captures sensitive information.",
      "Email rule creation: Once inside the account, scammers can create rules in email clients like Outlook that redirect or hide specific emails. This means that any communication related to fraudulent activities may go unnoticed by the victim.",
      "Impersonation: The scammer impersonates the victim and sends emails to contacts, such as banks or vendors, requesting urgent wire transfers or sensitive information.",
      "Execution: The scammer provides convincing details and urgency in their requests, making it appear as though the email is genuinely from the victim. They may use specific language or references only known to the victim and their contacts.",

      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Proactive steps to avoid being a victim of BEC scams",
      "To combat BEC and similar scams, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Use strong passwords:\u00a0Ensure passwords are complex (a mix of letters, numbers and symbols) and unique for each account.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

      "Additionally, the report\u2019s authors say the incoming Republican administration could also use targeted strikes against Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders, Quds Force and Intelligence Ministry assets inside Iran if Iran or its proxies harm Americans. Targeted strikes should also hit Iran\u2019s repressive apparatus through cyber and kinetic means if security forces violently suppress innocent protesters, as happened in 2009 after the disputed presidential election and in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by the morality police for not covering her hair with a hijab.",

The incoming Trump administration should reverse that calculus and one way to do so is to start holding Iran's regime responsible on Iranian soil for the terrorism of its proxies,\" Brodsky explained.

      "Blinken made his rulings, he stated, because \"the RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians, have systematically murdered men and boys\u2014even infants\u2014on an ethnic basis, and (have) deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.\"",
      "The Secretary continued,\u00a0\"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "Blinken added that the African nation is suffering through \"a conflict of unmitigated brutality that has resulted in the world\u2019s largest humanitarian catastrophe, leaving 638,000 Sudanese experiencing the worst famine in Sudan\u2019s recent history, over 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and tens of thousands dead.\"",
      "Risch has held out that the situation in Sudan has been catastrophic for well over a year, and called into question the timing of Blinken\u2019s declaration. In a statement earlier this week, he wrote, \"It has been nearly a year since I introduced a resolution calling the atrocities in Sudan what they are: a genocide. Additionally, I first called for Global Magnitsky sanctions to be imposed against the RSF and Hemedti 263 days ago \u2013 and yet these sanctions still have not been leveraged.\"",

      "Risch spoke to Fox News Digital, declaring,\u00a0\"The Biden Administration waited until it has less than two weeks in office to sanction RSF-affiliated companies\u00a0and Hemedti for their crimes and to call atrocities in Sudan a genocide.\"",

If the Biden Administration backed its rhetoric with action, Sudan would be in a better position today, more lives would be saved, and the foreign proxies exacerbating this conflict would be kept at bay.\"",
      "Risch added,\u00a0\"This war must end. Further instability in Sudan will only breed terrorism and regional turmoil, threatening global security. The U.S. and our allies must seek to end the killing and atrocities, end the malign actions by proxies, manage migration pressures from mass displacement and protect strategic interests like the Red Sea corridor.\"",

It requires information not only of certain acts but also that those acts were done with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a racial, ethnic, national, or religious group. Information demonstrating intent is often difficult to find and assess.\"\u00a0\"Since the start of the conflict the United States has taken repeated action to promote accountability of the RSF for its atrocities conduct. The U.S. already had sanctioned five RSF leaders, including two of Hemedti\u2019s brothers. We also determined in December 2023 that members of the RSF committed ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. So the designation of Hemedti and the genocide determination reflect a consistent effort to document and call out atrocities, acknowledge the suffering of victims and survivors, and pursue justice and accountability.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 06:21:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Lebanese parliament finally voted on a new president on Thursday following two years of deadlock. Joseph Aoun the head of the country&apos;s armed forces won a majority of the votes.",
    "story": [
      "Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah was planning to use bunker to stage attack on Israel. (Credit: IDF)",
      "Lebanon\u2019s political landscape has undergone a dramatic shift with the election of Joseph Aoun as president. After more than two years of political deadlock, the Lebanese Parliament elected the army commander on Thursday with 99 out of 128 votes.",
      "Aoun\u2019s election represents a significant achievement for the anti-Hezbollah camp, reflecting the weakening influence of the powerful Shia terrorist organization within Lebanon\u2019s political system. Despite this, experts say Hezbollah remains a formidable force in the country, and the challenges Aoun faces in balancing Lebanon's internal politics and foreign relations remain immense.",
      "For much of the past two years, Hezbollah worked tirelessly to block any movement toward the election of a new president. The group had strongly opposed Aoun\u2019s candidacy. However, as the political situation evolved and the ousting of Assad from Syria unfolded, Hezbollah was ultimately forced to accept Aoun, who secured the presidency.",
      "\"Hezbollah had been opposed to his election for the last two and a half years and had blocked any process toward electing a president for all that time. Now, they\u2019ve voted for him in the second round, which indicates they are in a bind, that they are weaker, and their leverage is not what it was,\" Vice President for International Engagement at the Middle East Institute Paul Salem told Fox News Digital.",

      "Salem points to the broader shift in regional politics, notably the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, which has left Hezbollah increasingly isolated. \"They are now not only cut off from Iran, but they're also isolated in the region. They're the only Shiite community between here and Basra, and it\u2019s a Sunni takeover of Damascus, which used to be dominated by a friendly Alawite, pro-Iranian regime. It\u2019s a huge historic shift that leaves the Shiites and Hezbollah deeply isolated. Hezbollah\u2019s future is worse than its present,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. and Israel, along with other Western and Arab powers, have long sought to distance Lebanon from Hezbollah\u2019s influence, and Aoun\u2019s election could be a step in that direction.",
      "Aoun, a Maronite Christian and the commander of the Lebanese army, took office with a strong message focused on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the necessity for the state to have a monopoly on the use of force.",
      "David Schenker, former head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department under the first Trump administration, remarked that Aoun\u2019s speech was both a positive and pragmatic step for Lebanon. \"He talked about disarming all groups and ensuring that weapons are under the control of the state,\" Schenker said. \"This was a good move, as it shows a commitment to sovereignty and the rule of law.\"",

      "An updated graphic detailing the members of Hezbollah's leadership who have been eliminated by the Israeli Defense Forces. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "However, Schenker, who is currently the Taube Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Linda and Tony Rubin Program on Arab Politics, cautioned that Aoun\u2019s position as president does not grant him absolute power in Lebanon\u2019s political system. \"The president is not the most powerful position in Lebanon. The key position will be the prime minister. It remains to be seen whether Aoun will show the same courage in his new role that he demonstrated as chief of staff,\" Schenker noted.",
      "Though Hezbollah has been militarily weakened by recent Israeli campaigns and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, among other key leaders, it still retains significant influence, particularly in southern Lebanon. However, Schenker says the organization\u2019s ability to intimidate Lebanon\u2019s population is diminishing. \"Hezbollah isn\u2019t the force it was. It can still reactivate its killing machine if needed, but it no longer dominates the way it did before,\" he said.",
      "\"Hezbollah has calculated that they\u2019ve lost this battle against Israel, and then they lost another battle in Syria. So their interest now is to lay low, have a president and government that\u2019s acceptable to the U.S. and the region, which, at the end of the day, they hope will protect them from any further Israeli incursions and help their people,\" Salem explained. \"They need a functioning government to secure international aid for the millions displaced by their actions in southern Lebanon. It\u2019s about survival for them, not just politically, but financially.\"",

      "Aoun\u2019s election is not only significant for Hezbollah\u2019s position in Lebanon, but also for the country\u2019s relations with external powers like the U.S. and Israel. Lebanon has faced economic collapse, with its currency devalued by over 99%, and nearly 80% of the population now living below the poverty line. Hezbollah\u2019s previous resistance to international pressure now seems less tenable.",
      "The U.S. has long supported Lebanon\u2019s military and is expected to strengthen its ties with Aoun, given his role in the army and his pro-sovereignty stance. Schenker said that Lebanon\u2019s future alignment with the U.S. and regional allies such as Saudi Arabia could provide the country with much-needed international support.",

      "\"The U.S. military has been close to the Lebanese military for many years,\" Salem told Fox News Digital. \"That has been the strongest link between the U.S. and Lebanon. So to have the head of the military come to power, he\u2019s a known figure in Washington. He\u2019s known to the military, and now, he\u2019s known to the diplomats and politicians, and will be known to President Trump and others over time. This realignment could put Lebanon on a much more natural path of cooperation with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other regional allies.\"",
      "Israel will also be closely monitoring Aoun\u2019s presidency. Schenker said that Aoun\u2019s commitment to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for disarmament in southern Lebanon, could lead to a more cooperative stance from Lebanon toward Israel. \"Israel will be invested in Lebanon\u2019s implementation of 1701,\" Schenker said. \"Aoun\u2019s stance will influence Israel\u2019s position toward Lebanon, as the Trump administration has clearly signaled a desire to end the wars in the region.\"",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Aides to Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was detained Thursday, followed moments later by official denials, in a confusing episode that capped a day of protests seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from clinging to power.",
      "It's not clear exactly what transpired after Machado bid farewell to hundreds of supporters, hopped on a motorcycle and raced with her security convoy through the empty streets of eastern Caracas to an undisclosed location.",
      "At 3:21 p.m. local time, Machado\u2019s press team said in a social media post that security forces \"violently intercepted\" her convoy. Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",
      "THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS AHEAD OF MADURO'S THIRD INAUGURATION",
      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",

In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",

      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\"Of course, there\u2019s fewer people,\" said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \"There\u2019s fear.\"",
      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \"colectivos\" to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\"It\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\" said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \"How Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\" in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\"Maduro is safe in office,\" said Corrales, \"but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",

      "The key to identifying the cause of the still-raging Palisades Fire lies on a brush-covered\u00a0hilltop where the blaze broke out just after 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday.",
      "Fire investigators are still working to determine what sparked the inferno, but experts say it\u2019s easy to rule out one common cause of wildfires: lightning. The region was free of stormy weather this week. The area near the Temescal Ridge Trail also appears to be free of power lines or transformers, which rules out another potential cause.",
      "Follow along for live updates",
      "That leaves the source of most wildfires: people. But was it a result of arson? Four experts interviewed by NBC News said it was a possibility, but they thought the fires were more likely not set on purpose.",
      "\u201cThis is what we call inaccessible, rugged terrain,\u201d said Rick Crawford, former battalion chief for the Los Angeles Fire Department. \u201cArsonists usually aren\u2019t going to go 500 feet off a trailhead through trees and brush, set a fire and then run away.\u201d",
      "Fires break out in the wooded areas on the edges of Los Angeles all the time \u2014 many of them caused unintentionally by homeless people.  The fires almost never grow into a destructive blaze due to the lack of high winds. The combination of ferocious winds and a parched landscape created ideal conditions for the fast-moving fires that have consumed large swaths of Los Angeles this week.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need a gang of arsonists to go out there and be starting fires because nature is taking care of that for you,\u201d said Scott Fischer, a retired federal law enforcement arson investigator.",
      "\u201cThere are arsonists out there,\u201d he added, \u201cbut are there a band of arsonists running around Los Angeles right now? Not likely.\u201d",
      "Copycat arson is a known phenomenon, however. The experts said they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of the smaller fires that broke out after the Palisades blaze was intentionally set.",
      "\u201cWhen you get a large fire event like this being experienced in Los Angeles, you sometimes trigger people to go out and light a fire,\u201d said Terry Taylor, a retired wildland fire investigator who now works as an instructor. \u201cIt\u2019s a copycat thing. ... It happens from time to time.\u201d",
      "Taylor and the other experts said it\u2019s unlikely those answers will come anytime soon, as determining arson tends to require a lengthy investigation.",
      "Eaton Fire",
      "The Eaton Fire, the second largest to wreak havoc in Los Angeles, is not one of those likely to have been started by an arsonist, the experts say. It erupted Tuesday evening in an area east of Altadena where an array of high-voltage transmission lines hovers overhead.",
      "Given the area and weather conditions, the fire experts said their first thought was power lines. Whipping winds can cause the lines to slap together, shedding small balls of superhot molten metal.",
      "\u201cIf the ground is really dry and the wind is blowing and poof \u2014 you have a fire,\u201d said Ed Nordskog, a retired detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department who spent his career investigating arsonists.",
      "But that\u2019s just one potential scenario. It\u2019s also possible that it was started by a person operating a camping stove or a car or lawn mower that ejected a hot spark onto dry grass, Nordskog said.",
      "As for the possibility it was intentionally set, Nordskog said it was unlikely.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, these fires are not arson,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no data supporting winds bringing out arsonists.\u201d",
      "\u2018Inch by inch\u2019",
      "Identifying the cause of a fire is a highly specialized and painstaking endeavor, experts say.",
      "The first step is pinpointing where it began. Things like burn patterns and charred debris can provide crucial clues.",
      "Then comes the most detailed and labor-intensive part of the process. The investigators will lay out a grid at the scene, typically with string, and literally crawl around on their hands and knees in search of footprints or other clues.",
      "The investigators often use metal detectors and magnifying glasses or even binoculars to help with their search.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll go inch by inch by inch, and it will take hours,\u201d said Nordskog. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun.\u201d",
      "In the case of the Eaton Fire, the investigators are likely to use magnets to help them hunt for the tiny, melted pieces of metal that could have been shed by power lines if they slapped together. But the existence of the metal doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that\u2019s how the fire started, Nordskog said.",
      "\u201cYou still have to figure out if the power lines\u2019 spark was because things were already on fire or what started the fire,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s so much stuff going on with an investigation, so many factors. Anybody tells you right away what caused the fire, they had to have seen it.\u201d",
      "If the investigators find evidence the fire was caused by a person, they must then work to determine whether it was the result of an accident, negligence or an intentional act.",
      "John Abatzoglou, a professor of climatology at the University of California, Merced, examined 30 years\u2019 worth of government fire occurrence data from Los Angeles County. It showed that the most common causes of wildfires from 1992 to 2020 were mishaps related to vehicles and other equipment.",
      "\u201cMore than 95% of these are human-ignited fires,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cArson is among the causes, but most human-caused fires are not intentional.\u201d",
      "\u2018The best players out there\u2019",
      "The prospect of arsonists torching Los Angeles gained traction on social media Thursday when a group of people in Woodland Hills detained a man they suspected of setting a trash fire. The man was arrested, but there was not enough probable cause to charge him with arson, police officials said Friday. He was arrested on a felony probation violation instead.",
      "In addition to the Palisades and Eaton fires, four others have burned across Los Angeles. The causes remain under investigation.",
      "A law enforcement task force has been set up to uncover what caused the fires. The local agencies involved \u2014 the Los Angeles fire and police departments and the county Sheriff\u2019s Department, as well as Cal Fire \u2014 are considered to be among the most skilled in the country. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the probe.",
      "\"Everything is absolutely on the table,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said at a news conference Saturday.",
      "It could take several days for investigators to determine the causes of the fires. Determining whether a fire found to have been started by a person is a criminal act could take several months or even years, the experts said.",
      "With the number of fire deaths reaching 24, the effort to uncover the causes is expected to go on for as long as it takes.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have the best players out there to be able to solve the problem,\u201d said Crawford, the retired Los Angeles battalion chief."

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The Senate is slated to hold more than a dozen hearings this week for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, with the hope of confirming them quickly.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-led Senate is slated to hold more than a dozen hearings this week for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, with the hope of confirming them quickly after he\u2019s inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "The selections coming before the Senate range from those who are expected to have smooth paths to confirmation, like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state, to others who face headwinds and need the hearings to garner support, such as former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, a military veteran, for defense secretary.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a little bit of a train wreck next week of confirmation hearings,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters last week. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad we\u2019re getting those done, and the FBI background check would naturally be a part of that process.\u201d",
      "The hearings kick off Tuesday with Hegseth; former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., Trump\u2019s pick for veterans affairs secretary; and former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for secretary of the interior.",
      "On Wednesday, hearings will feature Rubio; former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick to head the Justice Department; South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to head up the Department of Homeland Security; former National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe, who was picked to lead the CIA; former Trump White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who was tapped to fill the role again; former Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., who was selected for transportation secretary; and oil and gas industry executive\u00a0Chris Wright, Trump\u2019s choice for energy secretary.",
      "And the Thursday hearings will include a second day of Bondi appearing before senators; Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Trump\u2019s choice for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., the pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency; hedge fund executive\u00a0Scott Bessent, who\u2019s in line to lead the Treasury Department; and former NFL player Eric Scott Turner, who was tapped for housing and urban development secretary.",
      "Other hearings will be scheduled in the days and weeks ahead, too.",
      "If the prospective nominees are approved by the respective Senate committees that have oversight over their departments, they will require 50 votes from the full Senate to assure confirmation. Vice President-elect JD Vance will be able to break a tie starting Jan. 20, when he and Trump take office. Sen.-elect Jim Justice, R-W.Va., is expected to be sworn in before the inauguration. Republicans are down a seat due to Vance\u2019s resignation, but his successor can be sworn in quickly after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, selects one. That\u2019ll give the GOP 53 seats, allowing three defections before Democratic votes are needed.",
      "Some nominees will get Democratic votes. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has expressed support for Rubio, Stefanik and Duffy.",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019ve met everybody except Dr. Oz. But I\u2019m familiar with Dr. Oz,\u201d Fetterman said of Mehmet Oz, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, whom he defeated in the 2022 Pennsylvania Senate election. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him before.\u201d",
      "Cornyn said he \u201centhusiastically\u201d supports Rubio, his fellow Republican senator, and predicted that he wouldn\u2019t have a hostile hearing.",
      "\u201cI think that will be the closest hearing that\u2019s a lovefest of any of the confirmation hearings,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI can\u2019t say that about the other ones.\u201d",
      "Others face strong opposition from Democrats, who are warning Republicans not to rush through confirmations of candidates before their FBI background checks clear and the Senate takes the appropriate time to vet them. Democrats will seek to pressure GOP senators to sink some of the nominees.",
      "Hegseth has been battling allegations of sexual assault, excessive drinking and mismanaging the finances of a nonprofit veterans group.",
      "Several Republicans were initially noncommittal about supporting Hegseth, including Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a survivor of sexual assault and a member of the Armed Services Committee, the panel that will examine his nomination. While she hasn\u2019t said whether she plans to vote for him, Ernst has since released a statement saying she will \u201csupport Pete through this process\u201d and looks forward to \u201ca fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\u201d",
      "Ernst, who is up for re-election in 2026, has faced pressure from Trump allies to back him.",
      "The top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., also remained concerned about Hegseth\u2019s ability to lead the Defense Department after the two met last week.\u00a0Reed and the chair of the committee, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., received Hegseth\u2019s FBI background check late Friday.",
      "Along with Hegseth, several other Trump picks have faced bipartisan skepticism from senators, including Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who is now a Republican, to be the director of national intelligence, and former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary. Hearings for Gabbard and Kennedy haven\u2019t been scheduled yet.",
      "Gabbard has faced questions about her past dealings with foreign adversaries like former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. She recently shifted her views on a key intelligence gathering authority that she previously sought to dismantle when she served in the House of Representatives.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Gabbard said that if confirmed, she would work to uphold Section 702 of the Foreign Surveillance Act \u2014 an intelligence gathering tool passed by Congress after Sept. 11, 2001, that allows the government to conduct targeted surveillance of foreign nationals living outside the U.S. without needing to obtain a warrant.",
      "Still, Democrats aren\u2019t convinced. Gabbard was \u201cnoticeably noncommittal\u201d about her stance on the national security tool in her meeting with the Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., a source familiar with the matter said.",
      "The shift comes as Senate Republicans are pushing to hold Gabbard\u2019s confirmation hearing before Trump is sworn in. Senate Intelligence Chair Tom Cotton, R-Ark., committed to holding the hearing before Jan. 20, but her FBI background check and Office of Government Ethics paperwork had still not been received by the committee as of Friday, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "As of Friday, Senate committees set to hold hearings for Burgum and Wright were also missing key documentation that members traditionally receive beforehand. Burgum\u2019s and Wright\u2019s hearings are still slated for Tuesday and Wednesday despite objections from Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee.",
      "Bondi, the pick for attorney general, faces two days of hearings on Wednesday and Thursday. The former Florida attorney general, who served as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer during his first impeachment trial, has proved to be more palatable to Senate Judiciary Republicans following the collapse of former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s bid for the top post.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused his Republican colleagues of \u201crushing\u201d through the president-elect\u2019s picks without proper vetting.",
      "\u201cWhen Republicans, like the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, try to rush nominees before senators have even received basic information, such as background reports, Americans have to ask, what are Republicans trying to hide?\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor last week."

      "The moment should have been stressful \u2014 Washington, on the road in the NFL playoffs, faced third-and-1 with a chance to win the game.",
      "Yet during a brief break in play, with only 55 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels was seen laughing on the field while talking to Tampa Bay defenders across the line of scrimmage.",
      "During a superlative rookie season, Daniels has rarely looked bothered by a big stage. From his Hail Mary touchdown to beat Chicago to his 12 touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and overtime \u2014 the most ever by a rookie quarterback \u2014 Daniels has repeatedly produced in improbable ways that belie his lack of experience.",
      "That continued Sunday in Tampa Bay.",
      "After jawing with the Buccaneers defenders, Daniels converted that crucial third down in the final minute, setting up Washington\u2019s 37-yard game-winning field goal to beat Tampa Bay, 23-20. As time expired, Zane Gonzalez\u2019s kick bounced off the right upright and through to end a back-and-forth game featuring five lead changes and five gutsy fourth-down attempts by the Commanders.",
      "The Commanders now advance to the divisional round of the postseason facing the NFC's top seed, Detroit. The win was Washington\u2019s first in the playoffs since the 2005 season. Daniels was only 5 years old then; on Sunday he became only the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win on the road in a playoff debut by completing 24 of 35 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for team-high 36 yards.",
      "Baker Mayfield threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns for Tampa, but his fourth-quarter fumble led Washington to score a touchdown that put it ahead 20-17. It never gave up the lead again.",
      "It was the final game of a day on which Buffalo and Philadelphia also advanced to next week\u2019s divisional round of the playoffs.",
      "The Bills remained unbeaten at home this season by easily dispatching Denver, 31-7. Josh Allen threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns. Neither team committed a turnover, but while the Broncos missed a field goal, Buffalo was a perfect 3-for-3.",
      "Green Bay struggled from the start in its 22-10 loss at Philadelphia, fumbling its opening kickoff in the first of four Packers turnovers. They included three interceptions thrown by quarterback Jordan Love. Philadelphia\u2019s Jalen Hurts looked unbothered after having missed his previous two games under concussion protocol, and Saquon Barkley added 119 rushing yards.",
      "Two other teams punched their tickets to the divisional round Saturday: Houston \u2014 thanks to an incredible defensive effort with four interceptions of Justin Herbert \u2014 and Baltimore \u2014 thanks to continued dominance on the ground by Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry."

      "Vrabel, 49, went 54-45 in six seasons as the Titans\u2019 coach, plus a 2-3 record in the playoffs. He is also a former player for the Patriots, having played linebacker for the team from 2001-08, winning three Super Bowls.",
      "Vrabel was hired to replace Jerod Mayo, another former New England linebacker, who was fired after only one season with the team. Mayo went 4-13 in his lone year at the helm.",
      "During the 2024 season, Vrabel was a coaching consultant for the Cleveland Browns before his contract expired on Dec. 30 in anticipation of possible head coaching interviews.",
      "Vrabel was a coveted coaching candidate during this year\u2019s hiring cycle. He interviewed with the New York Jets and Chicago Bears before ultimately agreeing to a deal with the Patriots.",
      "Vrabel had a successful start to his tenure in Tennessee. His teams posted winning records in each of his first four seasons and made the playoffs in three straight seasons from 2019 to 2021. Under Vrabel, the Titans made the AFC championship game after the 2019 season. In 2021, Tennessee was the No. 1 seed in the AFC and had a first-round bye.",
      "The Titans missed the playoffs in Vrabel\u2019s last two seasons, however, and their win total decreased from seven to six from 2022 to 2023. In his six years with the team, Tennessee had six different starting quarterbacks.",
      "Vrabel\u2019s coaching career began in college with the Ohio State Buckeyes in 2011. He made the jump to the NFL in 2014, joining the Houston Texans\u2019 defensive staff. He was defensive coordinator for one season in 2017 before taking the Titans job.",
      "As a player, Vrabel started his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1997 after the team selected him in the third round of that year\u2019s draft. He spent four years with the Steelers before joining New England as a free agent.",
      "Vrabel became a franchise legend during his eight seasons with the Patriots as one of the best players on a defense that played a major role in the early years of New England\u2019s dynasty. Vrabel was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2023.",
      "New England should offer a more stable quarterback situation for Vrabel in his second head coaching stop. The team selected Drake Maye in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft, and he played well in his rookie season.",
      "In addition to Maye, the Patriots will have the fourth pick in the upcoming draft as well as over $130 million in cap space, per Spotrac."

      "According to CBS records, Nantz is the first person in CBS\u2019 storied NFL history to work 500 games as a play-by-play announcer. Pat Summerall did more than 500 games at CBS, but started as an analyst in 1962 after retiring from playing. He moved to play-by-play midway through the 1974 season.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of games. It\u2019s just staggering,\u201d Nantz said. \u201cWith the historic relationship between the league and CBS that no one else can boast about and to think I have been given the blessing of calling more NFL games play-by-play than anyone in the network\u2019s history, it\u2019s meaningful and something that resonates for me.\u201d",
      "Nantz will be the eighth NFL TV play-by-play announcer to reach 500 games, but only the second with all of his games at one network.",
      "Kenny Albert, who has done games since Fox got the NFL in 1994, reached the milestone on Oct. 13 when the Cleveland Browns faced the Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "According to research from the\u00a0506 Sports Archive, Al Michaels, Dick Stockton, Don Criqui, Summerall, Kevin Harlan and Charlie Jones, are also part of The 500 Club.",

      "Nantz\u2019s first NFL game for CBS was on Oct. 16, 1988, when he called the\u00a0Indianapolis Colts\u2019 35-31 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with Pat Haden. He called seven games between 1988 and \u201990 before being added to the regular rotation of announcers in 1991. In 1993, he was part of the network\u2019s No. 2 crew calling games with Randy Cross, and worked the NFC divisional round game between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers on Jan. 16, 1994.",
      "That would be the last NFL game Nantz would call for a while, though, as CBS lost the NFL rights to Fox.",
      "CBS regained the rights to the league beginning with the 1998 season, but Nantz would not return to the booth until 2004. He hosted \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d for six seasons (1998 though 2003).",

We\u2019re going to get the NFL back.\u2019\u201d Nantz said. \u201cI spent almost my youth daydreaming about working for CBS Sports one day. I loved the NFL presentation with Pat and Tom Brookshier, later Pat and John (Madden), and going back to Ray Scott. Sean knew me well enough from his days as an agent (at IMG), and he told me this is what I\u2019ve always wanted to do.",

This is his 21st season as CBS\u2019 lead announcer. The first 13 were with Phil Simms before Tony Romo became the lead analyst in 2017. Tracy Wolfson has been the sideline reporter since 2014.",
      "Nantz\u2019s other regular partners were Haden, Cross, Ken Stabler, Tim Brant, Hank Stram and Dan Fouts. Bill Cowher and Boomer Esiason were also in the booth for one-game stints.",

      "In a December interview with NBC News, Trump told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that on his first day in office he would pardon his supporters who rioted on Jan. 6, adding that the rioters have been prosecuted in a \u201cvery nasty system.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be acting very quickly, first day,\u201d Trump said, adding that the rioters who have been convicted have \u201cbeen in there for years, and they\u2019re in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to be open.\u201d",
      "Unlike Vance, Trump did not rule out pardoning those who pleaded guilty to violent crimes such as assaulting police officers.",
      "\u201cBecause they had no choice,\u201d Trump said about the guilty pleas, adding: \u201cI know the system. The system\u2019s a very corrupt system. They say to a guy, \u2018You\u2019re going to go to jail for two years or for 30 years.\u2019 And these guys are looking, their whole lives have been destroyed. For two years, they\u2019ve been destroyed.\u201d",
      "Last week Trump reiterated that he was considering \"major pardons\" for Jan. 6 rioters and would not rule out including them among his list of pardons when asked.",
      "Vance on Sunday did say \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of a gray area there\u201d regarding those who committed violent acts on Jan. 6, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.\u201d",
      "Later, in a post on X, Vance elaborated on his remarks, saying he and the president-elect would evaluate each Jan. 6 case individually and that violent offenders who were \u201cprovoked\u201d would be evaluated for pardons, too.",
      "\u201cThe president saying he\u2019ll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walkback. I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial,\u201d Vance wrote.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment on this story.",
      "Since January 2021, more than 1,270 defendants have been convicted in connection with their actions at the Capitol and more than 1,580 have been arrested. More than 700 have completed their sentences or were never penalized with jail or prison time."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department, officials said in a court\u00a0filing Saturday.",
      "The move was expected ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "Smith\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in 2020 election interference is expected to be released soon. Trump has denied the allegations.",
      "\u201cThe Special Counsel completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on January 7, 2025, and separated from the Department on January 10,\u201d a government court filing said in a footnote.",
      "The footnote was part of a Justice Department filing in which the government asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, not to extend a restriction that is temporarily blocking part of Smith\u2019s report from being released.",
      "Trump had been indicted on charges related to allegations that he attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He had entered a not guilty plea before the case was dropped. The federal charges, brought by Smith, were dismissed after Trump was elected in 2024. The Justice Department has a long-standing policy not to prosecute a sitting president.",
      "Smith was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland said at the time that appointing Smith was in \u201cthe public interest\u201d because Trump had announced his candidacy and Biden was also planning to run for a second term. Garland, who had been appointed by Biden, said in 2022 that his selection of Smith \u201cunderscores the Department\u2019s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters.\u201d",
      "Smith oversaw investigations into Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, as well as allegations that he mishandled classified documents.",
      "The former president was indicted in the classified documents case as well, though Cannon dismissed the case in July 2024, deciding that Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded. Trump had pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "The president-elect frequently criticized Smith, and he said in October that he would \u201cfire him within two seconds\u201d of taking office.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal appeals court ruled that the Justice Department could release Smith\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The court, however, kept in place Cannon\u2019s order that the report\u2019s release must be delayed for three days to allow for Trump to consider whether to appeal the decision further.",
      "Cannon said in a Saturday order that the Justice Department must submit a filing by 10 a.m. on Sunday confirming that the volume of Smith\u2019s report about alleged election interference does not discuss Walt Nauta or Carlos De Oliveira, two co-defendants in the classified documents case. Although the classified documents case against Trump was dropped, Nauta and De Oliveira still face charges.",
      "Smith has said that he would not release the second volume of his report regarding the classified documents case as charges against the co-defendants are pending."

    "summary": "Across the spectrum of American society, leaders who once shunned Trump or battled him are now seeking to bolster their ties or extend olive branches.",
    "story": [
      "In the weeks and months after Donald Trump won his shock election victory in 2016, business and tech leaders began a steady march leftward, adopting policies and postures to counter his influence on America.",
      "Media outlets reckoned with what some saw as their leading role in helping Trump get elected and pledged to be ruthless and unintimidated in their coverage of him and his administration.",
      "And Democrats, boosted by a grassroots \u201cresistance,\u201d readied for their biggest fight yet.",
      "That couldn\u2019t be any more different from the run-up to Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Now, executives are bending policies \u2014 and bending a proverbial knee \u2014\u00a0by abandoning their social and environmental agendas in manners that could appeal to Trump. Leaders of multiple major media platforms appear to be reorienting their coverage to be less antagonistic. And Democrats, without much of an active resistance to underpin them, have taken a wait-and-see approach to a new president with whom they already have eight years of experience.",
      "\u201cWe should treat him like a normal president,\u201d a senior aide to a Democratic senator said. \u201cBecause this is what normal presidents look like in America now.\u201d",
      "The shift is due in no small part to how Trump won last fall. Whereas in 2016 many saw a fluke, Trump this time swept the swing states and won the popular vote. His victory came after episodes like the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his criminal indictments \u2014 headwinds many believed were insurmountable.",
      "What\u2019s more, much of his opposition, at least for now, appears to be drained after having fought him for nearly a decade. Now, Democrats feel they must pick their spots better.",
      "\u201cMy mission: be purposeful,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., whose profile soared as a leading Trump adversary during the president-elect\u2019s first term, wrote to NBC News. \u201cDon\u2019t chase the crazy. Bring it all back to \u2018how does that (ahem, invading Greenland) lower the cost of eggs?\u2019\u201d",
      "In turn, Trump is basking in a relatively warm embrace. His inaugural committee has raised so much money that it has run out of perks to give donors, The New York Times reported. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, which banned Trump from those social media platforms after the 2021 attack on the Capitol, has donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. So has Amazon, which this week announced it will release a Melania Trump documentary through its Amazon Prime platform. The incoming first lady is listed as an executive producer of the project, which Amazon licensed for $40 million, Puck News reported.",
      "On Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg cited the political climate\u2019s shift back toward Trump as his company made a flurry of moves indicating a desire to get right with the right. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, meanwhile, has spoken optimistically about Trump\u2019s potential anti-regulatory agenda in a new term. And five of the country\u2019s biggest banks have in recent weeks announced their withdrawals from a pandemic-era climate coalition, the latest pullback from the environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, initiatives that became a major target for criticism on the right.",
      "\u201cMaybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but it is a little concerning that everybody sort of just said, \u2018We've got to give this guy what he wants,\u2019 right?\u201d a Pennsylvania Democrat said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where the backstop is here.\u201d",
      "Trump views the dynamic more charitably.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to be my friend,\u201d he said in December.",
      "NBC News spoke with more than a dozen Democratic and Republican operatives and lobbyists, granting many of them anonymity to speak openly about the shifting energy that has followed Trump\u2019s win.",
      "A Republican lobbyist said the significant donations to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund and the abandonment of left-leaning corporate policies come as executives are \u201cscared to death\u201d of what the incoming administration could mean for them.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to pretend like they\u2019re in control,\u201d this person said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re just kind of nervous about being shut out entirely.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re pulling out of work from home. ESG. DEI,\u201d this person continued, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. \u201cThey\u2019re bending to his will, not the other way around.\u201d",
      "\u2018Surrender, or acceptance\u2019",
      "Meta\u2019s moves are among the most noteworthy. The company plans to elevate Republican Joel Kaplan to lead its global policy team, and on Monday it added Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a Trump ally, to its board. Meta also announced it was ending a fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to the one Trump ally Elon Musk\u2019s X uses. And Zuckerberg boasted that the company was relocating content moderators from liberal California to ruby red Texas.",
      "\u201cRemember, at the start of Trump\u2019s first term, the mantra on the left is to not normalize,\u201d a veteran tech industry lobbyist said. \u201cDo not normalize. That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s not just a question for the tech companies, but a larger societal, cultural and political issue,\u201d this person added. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of surrender, or acceptance.\u201d",
      "Eight years ago many top tech executives treated Trump as something of a curiosity. Meetings with him were more perfunctory and for show. Relationships soon worsened. Trump stridently criticized Bezos and the newspaper he owns, The Washington Post. Zuckerberg, too, was a frequent target, including last year, when Trump threatened him with \u201clife in prison\u201d if he did anything Trump viewed as illegal during the campaign. Both men have met privately with Trump in recent weeks, as have Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and former Alphabet President Sergey Brin.",
      "A source close to Trump said tech executives like Zuckerberg and Bezos are \u201csmart to play ball\u201d with him in a way they weren\u2019t eight years ago.",
      "\u201cThey know the anti-Trump side lost, and they know if they aren\u2019t playing nice with him, he\u2019ll try to bust them up,\u201d this person said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a mix of fear, a mix of times-are-changing.\u201d",
      "A Republican operative close to Trump\u2019s circle described corporate America\u2019s response to the 2024 election as the exact inverse of its response after 2016.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that culturally, [Meta] and other companies feel like \u2018You know what? We actually don\u2019t need to be bullied by activists anymore,\u2019\u201d the operative said.",
      "Against that backdrop, intense disputes have broken out at a number of leading news organizations, including Bezos\u2019 Post as the newsroom navigates Trump\u2019s return to power.",
      "The Post, even though its editorial page staff drafted an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, declined back a presidential candidate \u2014 a widely criticized decision that sources attributed to Bezos \u2014 just two weeks before the election. Last week, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit the paper after editors refused to publish her drawing depicting Bezos and other corporate leaders bending the knee to Trump. The Post\u2019s editorial page editor said the cartoon was rejected because the content was too similar to a recent column and that the decision was not a \u201creflection of a malign force.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, prompted resignations last year when he killed his editorial board\u2019s planned endorsement of Harris. Soon-Shiong has since proposed instituting a \u201cbias meter\u201d to evaluate the paper\u2019s published opinions while trying to steer a more moderate direction.",
      "At broadcast and cable outlets, there has been turmoil, too. ABC paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit with Trump. And at MSNBC, \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who have been known for their critical stance toward Trump in recent years, traveled to his Mar-a-Lago resort to meet with him after the election. Both episodes drew some criticism. While ABC did not elaborate on its decision to settle the suit, Scarborough and Brzezinski have defended their meeting with Trump as a useful reporting trip that helped inform their viewers.",
      "\u2018No one\u2019s quite sure what to do\u2019",
      "For Democrats, this is a confusing time. Many state-level leaders say they will find areas to work together with the administration while they push back against efforts they believe are harmful. In Congress, Democrats have expressed openness to some of Trump\u2019s more controversial Cabinet selections, like his pick for the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Others signed onto a Republican-backed immigration bill that advanced in the Senate on Thursday, the Laken Riley Act, which would allow the Department of Homeland Security to detain noncitizens who are charged with certain crimes.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s quite sure what to do,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democrat said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything yet that shows me anybody\u2019s quite ready for this.\u201d",
      "Democrats, including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, have even expressed openness to Trump\u2019s calls to annex Greenland or rename the Gulf of Mexico \u2014\u00a0if other conditions are met first. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has expressed more openness to Trump than his Democratic colleagues, announced Thursday that he will soon meet with Trump, becoming the first sitting Democratic senator to do so since Trump won last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary to commit to cooperation with him at this point,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democrat said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to gain from that.\u201d",
      "In a video posted to social media on Thursday, many Senate Democrats laid out their posture entering a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe are not here because of who we are against,\u201d the senators read. \u201cWe are here because of who we are for. \u2026 We are here to fight for Americans. We will work with anyone if they want to make life better for you. But if Donald Trump and Senate Republicans do things to hurt you, we will fight.\u201d",
      "The Republican operative close to Trump\u2019s circle said it\u2019s clear that this time around the Democratic response is \u201c100% different\u201d from what it was after Trump\u2019s 2016 win.",
      "\u201cThe resistance is dead,\u201d this person said. \u201cThere is no resistance anymore.\u201d",
      "But without Trump\u2019s even having taken office yet, some Democrats say it\u2019s far too soon to write off the anti-Trump opposition. Once he begins enacting policies, Democrats and outside allies will have more to push back on.",
      "Amanda Litman, a co-founder and the president of Run for Something, a grassroots progressive candidate recruitment group, said more than 12,000 people have signed up to run for offices since Trump\u2019s victory, a number she said nearly matched the total number of people who signed up in 2017, its launch year.",
      "\u201cA lot of the big \u2018resistance\u2019 stuff didn\u2019t really start happening until after Trump actually took office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels really early to say the resistance is fake or is dead. I think it\u2019ll look different. I think it\u2019ll feel different.\u201d",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans also urged caution on the olive branches and calls for bipartisanship Democrats have offered in recent weeks, noting that after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, Schumer also laid out areas in which the incoming administration and Democratic leaders could work together \u2014\u00a0an effort that in no way stunted the anti-Trump backlash.",
      "But for Democrats who were working in Washington during Trump\u2019s last transition, there was acknowledgment that something very different is happening now \u2014\u00a0and that there is a wider array of policies Democrats will be more likely to work with Trump and his allies on, with the Laken Riley Act serving as an early example.",
      "\u201cThere is an openness here this time that just did not exist last time,\u201d said the senior aide to a Democratic senator. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s especially [true] on immigration.\u201d",
      "This person said the driving force was the election itself. Democrats viewed 2016 as \u201ca freak accident\u201d compared with 2024, amounting to having \u201cflat-out lost.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe got to sit here in the corner for a little bit until they start doing their thing, and we\u2019ll figure out our footing from that point,\u201d this person said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any agreement on what Democrats should be doing right now.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Democrats will stand by idly during, say, Trump\u2019s mass deportation effort, as a former senior staff member for Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden said. This person said China policy, infrastructure, drug pricing and reshoring manufacturing are all policy areas in which Democrats will seek to work with Trump while fighting \u201ctooth and nail against mass deportations\u201d or any efforts to \u201cweaponize\u201d the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cThe party is going through a moment of disbelief that they lost,\u201d this person said.",
      "It\u2019s even trickier at the state level, where many of the Democratic Party\u2019s top presidential prospects reside. Governors including Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, Gavin Newsom in California \u2014 whom Trump has spent days blaming for devastating wildfires around Los Angeles \u2014 Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania and JB Pritzker in Illinois try to toe a fine line.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all working together, obviously, but there\u2019s a little bit of an island\u201d for each governor, said a senior aide to a Democratic governor. \u201cObviously Pritzker\u2019s got the safeguarding democracy thing. Gavin Newsom is calling special sessions. I think everybody\u2019s trying to individually find their path forward, to be unique in a way that doesn\u2019t draw unnecessary attention but highlights that you know they care about their own particular state.\u201d",
      "Democratic pollster John Anzalone said newfound bipartisanship \u201cis a winning equation for everyone\u201d in this moment, particularly at the state level. He praised remarks by Whitmer.",
      "\u201cLook at Whitmer, she basically said Trump loves Michigan, too, and we will work with him to get done what is needed for Michigan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to stand up when he is wrong and just as important to come together and get things done.\u201d",
      "But that approach has roiled some on the left, who struggle to believe Democrats can be taking such a wait-and-see approach to a president whose actions and governance aren\u2019t mysteries.",
      "\u201cTo see some Democrats saying, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just wait and see\u2019 \u2014 no, we actually don\u2019t need to wait and see,\u201d said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a progressive grassroots group. \u201cWe have the better part of a decade of evidence and all his campaign promises to tell us what he intends to do.\u201d"

The most propitious of these days occur in cycles of 12 years during a festival called the Maha Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival."

      "The Denver-based center was established in 2017 to deal with sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports from the elite level down to the grassroots.

    "story": [
      "The morning after Election Day last year, Melanie Claros, a civics teacher and ESL coordinator at a South Florida school where half the students are Latino, found herself having to do a job beyond her usual duties.",
      "By the end of the day, she recently told NBC News, more than two dozen students had separately approached her to ask about changes to immigration enforcement ahead of another Donald Trump presidency.",
      "\u201c\u2018Are they going to deport all of us now?\u2019 \u2018Who is going to get deported first?\u2019\u201d she recalled students asking her during class.",
      "The concerns have not abated since then, Claros said, noting she knows of at least one student who has already stopped showing up to school for immigration-related reasons. \u201cI am very suspicious that we will have [more] kids that will be withdrawn or just stop showing up to school,\u201d she said.",
      "Claros is one of several educators across six states who told NBC News they have found themselves in the uncomfortable position of fielding questions about potential mass deportations under the Trump administration. Many teachers and administrators are aware of a variety of scenarios that could start playing out very soon: immigration officials asking about a student; a kid who leaves school for the day only to discover that their parents have been detained and no one is home to care for them; students worried about deportation who simply stop coming to class. Educators and advocates say they feel they have to be prepared for these situations, but they are also keenly aware of the risk of backlash that can come with talking about a political issue like this\u00a0publicly.",
      "This dilemma has left teachers like Claros in disbelief.",
      "She became a teacher knowing she\u2019d have to talk about civics, she said, but \u201cI never in a million years thought that they [students] would ask me and have fears about immigration.\u201d",
      "Supporters of Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations say an increase in immigration enforcement is necessary to decrease the incidence of crime committed by migrants and deter individuals from illegally crossing the border in record numbers. However, critics say they\u2019re concerned about the possibility of family separations and widespread fear among certain communities.",
      "Several educators told NBC they feel it\u2019s in a community\u2019s best interest that kids, regardless of legal status, have the opportunity to go to school. Jasmin Baxter leads the communications office in the Hattiesburg, Mississippi, school district, which has a significant English-learner population. She said the district is committed to making sure all students feel supported.",
      "\u201cYou come to school, you\u2019re supposed to feel safe at school. Those outside factors you\u2019re not supposed to be thinking about while you\u2019re getting an education,\u201d Baxter said.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been easy for school districts to answer questions from families on immigration or talk about what they\u2019re doing to prepare for possible mass deportations.",
      "\u201cIt definitely is tricky for us to talk about it,\u201d said one assistant principal in California who asked that their name not be used so they could talk freely about the issue. \u201cBecause even if it is like, \u2018Here is how we support our students,\u2019 we\u2019d be getting pushback from families and community members.\u201d",
      "Viridiana Carrizales, co-founder of the nonprofit organization ImmSchools, says she\u2019s also seen reluctance from schools to be seen seeking out information on immigration and what to do in the event of an encounter with federal officials.",
      "\u201cMany of them are saying the moment we put our names out there, we become a target,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite this, in the days following the election, ImmSchools received messages from 37 schools it hadn\u2019t previously worked with asking about training opportunities and information for their staff, she said. Just before Christmas, the organization also held a virtual training session with 29 superintendents about how to prepare for any immigration raids or deportations that affect their student populations.",
      "\u201c[Schools] are really afraid and they are trying to figure out ways to best support families through this,\u201d she said.",
      "Educators are also expecting students to begin disappearing from their classrooms altogether, as Claros has already seen happening in her school. Parents may be nervous about being separated from their children if either are detained, or think that their child\u2019s presence in school could lead to authorities learning they are in the country without authorization.",
      "In Michigan, ESL teacher Karen Iglesias said she\u2019s heard students ask if they are going to get deported and had parents tell her they\u2019re scared to drive to their kids\u2019 school.",
      "Cinthya Longoria, an elementary school teacher in north Texas, says she\u2019s trying her best to support parents who feel anxious about the future as she remains uncertain about her own. Longoria is currently a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provides temporary legal protection against removal for some immigrants brought to the U.S. without documentation as children. She recently had a parent ask her for reassurance that their family would be OK under the new administration, she said.",
      "\u201cI just told her I hope so,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t tell her yes. That\u2019s when I told her I was a DACA recipient. At that moment, that was the only thing that I could tell her without being dishonest.\u201d",
      "Federal laws prohibit schools from denying students free public education based on immigration status and regulate the disclosure of students\u2019 personal information. Those laws, in addition to Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, are meant to serve as safeguards for undocumented families concerned about enrolling their kids into schools, experts say.",
      "\u201cTaken together, these are a fairly robust set of protections against immigration enforcement actions against students in school, especially where the school district is committed to protecting its noncitizen students,\u201d said Nayna Gupta, policy director for the nonprofit American Immigration Council.",
      "Under current policy, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement generally steers clear of areas where people receive public services, including schools, hospitals and churches. But under the Trump administration, this \u201csensitive locations\u201d or \u201cprotected areas\u201d policy is slated to go away, three people familiar with the plan to end it previously told NBC News.",
      "Denver Public Schools in Colorado and the Canutillo Independent School District in Texas both issued statements about the possible policy change, emphasizing the need to have \u201cdisruption-free learning.\u201d",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time schools have found themselves at the center of immigration issues. In 2019, during the first Trump administration, a series of ICE raids resulted in the arrest of about 700 workers from seven Mississippi food processing plants. As a result, district officials told NBC News at the time, local organizations and schools had to find safe spaces for children to go in the absence of their parents. One Mississippi school district said it had instructed bus drivers to ensure that they saw a parent or guardian present at the time a child was being dropped off \u2014 if not, they brought the child back to school to spend the night there.",
      "This history has shaped the way some advocacy groups and educators are now preparing families.",
      "In Tucson, Arizona, a coalition of nonprofits is helping families make \u201cemergency packets\u201d containing key information in case a parent is detained or deported, including a power of attorney for guardianship, emergency contacts and instructions about how to talk to children about who will be responsible for them in their parents\u2019 absence.",
      "The assistant principal in California told NBC News she and some of her colleagues have even offered up their homes.",
      "\u201cWe have spoken to families that have come forward about their status and have made it clear that their child can stay with one of us if their family were to be deported as an option for them,\u201d she said."

I mean, I can think of 100 families, and there are 5,000 homes lost\u2026 I could just write out a list of 100 friends who lost their homes. I feel almost guilty walking through my house. Just, you know, what can I do? How can I help? What do I have to offer with these hands and these walls and the safety that I have?\u201d",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re the staple of the community,\u201d Garner replied. \u201cHonestly, the Palisades feels like a little neighborhood. So it\u2019s almost like Sesame Street, like, you know the people who are serving our food. You care about each other. There\u2019s a reciprocity here. There\u2019s a real love here, and we\u2019ve got to take care of them.\u201d",
      "She said it is also important to support children who have lost schools, homes, churches and playgrounds.",
      "\u201cThe people are strong, and the sense of community is strong. We will look after each other and that is still here. That\u2019s stronger than ever,\" she said. \"And just like chef said, I\u2019ve gotten to visit so many disaster relief areas, and I mean, this is tragic, but you always find love and hope.\u201d",

    "summary": "Mike Leigh's \"Hard Truths,\" starring Marianne Jean-Baptiste, is leaving audiences with a lot of questions about its ending. Here's what the star says it means.",
    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re paying attention to this year\u2019s film awards season, you\u2019ve probably heard of Mike Leigh's new British drama called \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Set in London, the 97-minute film centers on Pansy (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a woman deeply unhappy with the world and takes it out on everyone around her, including her long-suffering husband Curtley (David Webber), her adult son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) who lives at home, and even her seemingly happy sister Chantelle (Michele Austin).",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is somewhat of a reunion for director Mike Leigh and Jean-Baptiste who worked together nearly 30 years ago on his Oscar-nominated film \"Secrets & Lies.\" The two also teamed up the following year when he used some of her music in his film \"Career Girls.\"",
      "Similar to his latest film, \"Secrets & Lies\" also centered on Jean-Baptiste, but as an adopted Black woman who traces her family history and discovers her biological mother is white. It also generated much critical-acclaim, including five Oscar nominations.",
      "\"Hard Truths\" appears to be following suit; it has already received early award season buzz \u2014 and accolades. It won a National Board of Review award, and Jean-Baptiste has won awards from critics organizations in New York, San Diego, Toronto, Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "With the film's release in theaters on Jan. 10, there will be many who see the film who'll likely have a slew of questions as the final credits roll. Namely, happened to Pansy and Curtley and what is the takeaway?",
      "Let\u2019s dive a little deeper, and hear from the film\u2019s star, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and directer to understand the film's cryptic ending.",
      "Note: Spoilers about the end of \u201cHard Truths\u201d ahead.",
      "What is \u2018Hard Truths\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is a small independent film that focuses on Pansy, the matriarch of a small family living in London. Pansy is deeply unhappy with the world, and takes it out on everyone around her, including her husband Curtley, son Moses, and sister Chantelle.",
      "As Jean-Baptiste tells TODAY.com, \u201c(Pansy) is somebody who has a lot of anxiety and fear\u2026 She\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy life and doesn\u2019t quite understand why, and blames other people for it\u2026. I\u2019ve seen people that are quite similar to her, and observed that way they present in the world.\u201d",
      "But, as viewers soon learn, Pansy's temperament isn't solely based on her interactions with others; her frustration also comes from unresolved grief. There's an important scene in the film where Pansy and Chantelle go to their mother's gravesite; Pansy is abrasive and dismissive at first, but the sisters end up talking about their mother, Pearl's, death.",
      "\"Your memory of Pearl is not the same as mine,\" insists Pansy. She is resentful that she had to be the one who found their mother \"lying stiff in the bed\" with her eyes still open, \"Accusing. Disappointed.\"",
      "One of the film's critical moment comes when Pansy reveals that she thinks everyone hates her, to which Chantelle responds that she loves her \"but I don't understand you.\"",
      "Pansy\u2019s revelation helps shed insight on her complicated relationship with the world, and how she\u2019s surrounded herself with people she can barely stand. Chantelle offers Pansy an opportunity for respite amid her suffering: she tells her to simply walk away. But Pansy doesn't seem ready to do that.",
      "Leigh said he used locations, like Pansy's house, as way to highlight and reflect her inner mental health struggles.",
      "\"The choice of locations is critical... In this film, most obviously, you can see that Pansy\u2019s house is a function of her paranoia, her fear of stuff and things and plants and insects and all the rest of it, whereas (her sister) Chantal\u2019s flat is a celebration of color and light and plants and joy,\" he told Film Comment in Oct. 2024. \"For me, that\u2019s what it\u2019s always been about.\u00a0\"",
      "What happens at the end of \u2018Hard Truths\u2019?",
      "Don\u2019t expect some big twist or denouement at the end of the film. It seems to just \u2026 end. But \u201cHard Truths\u201d isn\u2019t a movie that\u2019s going to give easy answers or wrap things in a bow.",
      "The last twenty minutes or so of \u201cHard Truths\u201d stops being about Pansy taking everything out on the world, and becomes a bit more of the world reacting to her. Following a series of increasingly tense moments \u2014 a meltdown at her Mother\u2019s Day gathering, throwing her husband's clothes out of their bedroom, calling him \u201cdisgusting\u201d \u2014 Curtley is injured while at work.",
      "His co-worker brings him home and tells Pansy what\u2019s going on, but she doesn\u2019t appear to want to leave the bedroom after being woken up \u2014 instead she quietly sits in a chair by the bed.",
      "The final scenes are close-ups of Curtley, a single tear running down his face as he waits for his wife to come down and comfort him; and Pansy, also in a close-up, her expression almost unreadable. She\u2019s not happy or sad. She lets out a small breath. And then the film ends.",
      "So what does the ending of \u2018Hard Truths\u2019 mean?",
      "Leigh is not going to do your homework for you. He\u2019s been open about working with a very loose script, and has said his actors do a certain amount of improvisation.",
      "\"For me, every film is a learning curve. And the great thing about being able to work, in this particular case, with actors with this particular background, is they\u2019re able to come up with what this character would say,\" Leigh said during a tastemakers screening attending by TODAY.com. \"I'm there to learn from and to take from (them). And if you like to put it more crudely, to exploit their experience, their knowledge and understanding.\"",
      "Jean-Baptiste also shared her thoughts on the significance of the ending, telling TODAY.com that they \"leave it to the audience\" to figure out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intentional on Mike Leigh\u2019s part (to keep things ambiguous). As far as I was concerned, I didn\u2019t know it was the ending when we were doing that scene, because you don\u2019t know what the film\u2019s about or what\u2019s happening. You don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s going to film stuff after that,\u201d she says.",
      "In fact, the first time she saw the ending was when she saw the completed film. As Jean-Baptiste explains, until the end of the film you\u2019ve been watching a woman who \u201cis unable to help themselves.\u201d So when she has an injured husband downstairs, \u201cHow is she going to help anyone else? And that\u2019s as much as I can give you. The rest is for the audience to take in, to argue about with their friends and come up with whatever ending they want to put on it.\u201d",
      "What did you think of the ending of \u201cHard Truths\u201d?",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d a Bleecker Street film, in now available in theaters."

I am Olivia Benson.\u2019 And (Wolf) was sort of laughing, I could tell, and I was like, \u2018No, no, you don\u2019t understand.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cSo, it was \u2014 just felt meant to be,\u201d she added.",
      "Early on, the two also recognized the unique gift of their connection.",

It\u2019s chemistry, right? And, we were just always very important people in each other\u2019s lives, and we knew it. We knew it from Minute 1. And we\u2019re still very close, very close.\u201d",

      "\u201cWell, I knew quickly that we had this kind of magical chemistry. I knew that, because I felt it, and we were so close so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd again, it\u2019s that thing we talked about, of that thing that happens with somebody where you\u2019re like, \u2018We are so different, and I know you, and I get it, all of it.\u2019\u201d",

      "Hargitay also credits the dynamics of Benson and Stabler\u2019s characters as part of the show\u2019s \u201cgenius.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that the genius of the conception of my show was the architecture of the angry, protective father and the nurturing, loving, empathetic mother, right, between us,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt was a perfect balance,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou want him to fight and protect you, and you want me to hold you, to hold a space for those most tender feelings after we\u2019ve been violated. And you want, as we all want, to be seen. Probably one of the most important things, I think, in the human condition, that we all want to be seen.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In the U.K., Robbie Williams is a major megastar \u2014 and has been for decades. But not so much in the U.S. For whatever reason, Williams\u2019 charming, edgy pop tunes and self-deprecating sense of humor never have quite clicked with Americans.",

      "Let\u2019s find out why.",
      "Who is Robbie Williams?",
      "Williams, now 50, got his start in a big boy band that debuted in the 1990s called Take That. They were huge in the U.K., and still rock out today with three members (but not Williams).",
      "Williams left in 1995 and went solo, releasing his debut album, \u201cLife thru a Lens\u201d in 1997. His single \u201cAngels\u201d was a hit in the U.K., but only charted at No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. \u2014 though it\u2019s since been covered by artists ranging from Jessica Simpson to Josh Groban.",
      "Williams has since gone on release 14 studio albums, with seven No. 1 singles in the U.K., and broke a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in one day to his \u201cClose Encounters Tour.\u201d",
      "His life hasn\u2019t been all broken records and chart-toppers. He\u2019s had to overcome mental health issues and addictions over the years, as the movie depicts.",

      "What is \u2018Better Man\u2019?",
      "\"Better Man\" is a live-action biopic about Williams in which he's portrayed as a chimpanzee, unlike everyone else in the film. No characters comment on his appearance, however.",
      "The movie follows his story of great fame and great talent, battling with emotional pain, illness and estrangement with his father.",
      "Williams is his own narrator and singer in the film, while Jonno Davies plays the chimp form. The movie is directed by Michael Gracey, who also directed Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron in 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Showman.\u201d",
      "Weta FX, the special effects team behind the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d reboots, are behind the movie magic.",
      "Why is Robbie Williams an ape in \u2018Better Man\u2019?",
      "First off, let\u2019s be clear: Chimpanzees are not monkeys \u2014 even if that's the word often used to describe the \"Better Man\" character. Chimps are apes. (The quickest way to tell between an ape and a monkey? Whether the animal has a tail. Apes don't have them; monkeys generally do)",
      "As to why Williams is a chimp? Well, it\u2019s a metaphor.",
      "In a promotional video where Williams and Gracey interview each other, Gracey told his star, \u201cIn your own words you would refer to being dragged up on stage to perform like a monkey. I immediately thought of portraying you not as we see you, but as how you see yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith your voice and that monkey, I\u2019m going to see you and relate to you in a way that is going to be more engaging than yet another musical biopic,\u201d Gracey added.",
      "In an interview with the Associated Press, Williams said that he\u2019s identified with primates for a long time.",
      "\u201cMy MO has been cheeky,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a cheeky monkey all my life. There\u2019s no more cheekier monkey than the coke-snorting, sex-addict monkey that we find in the movie.\u201d",
      "Plus, Williams said, the gimmick was a way for the audience to better identify with him.",
      "\u201cWe care for animals more than we care for humans, most of us,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to USA Today, Williams also called the premise \"genius\" in the way that it hooks audiences.",
      "The decision \u201chas done what it was supposed to do, which is to get people talking and be contentious. I would say it\u2019s about eight to 12 minutes where the audience is going, \u2018What?\u2019 and then you completely forget and you\u2019re taken on a ride that you\u2019ve never seen,\u201d he said."

      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third challenge, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him."

      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",

      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "The United States, European Union and some Arab nations began imposing sanctions after\u00a0Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown\u00a0on the 2011 uprising against his rule and tightened them as the conflict spiraled into war.

      "Trump \u201cspeaks very boldly on a lot of things,\u201d Lankford said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this over how he\u2019s done negotiations, whether it be for real estate or whether \u2014 how he served as a great president just four years ago.\u201d",
      "Lankford\u2019s comments come as Trump has shown a renewed interest in annexing Greenland over the last few weeks.",
      "In a statement announcing his pick to be ambassador to Denmark last month, Trump wrote: \u201cFor purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\u201d",
      "And days later, in a Christmas Day post on Truth Social, the president-elect addressed \u201cthe people of Greenland, which is needed by the United States for National Security purposes and, who want the U.S. to be there, and we will!\u201d",

      "\u201cWe need them for economic security,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cQuite frankly, the president\u2019s been very clear,\u201d Lankford said Sunday. \u201cHe is the president that kept American troops out of war. He is not looking to be able to go start a war, to go expand American troops, but he does want to be able to protect America\u2019s national security, and part of that is our economic security and our future.\u201d",
      "Presidents have conducted broad counterterrorism operations under the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force that were passed more than 20 years ago in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The authorizations have largely been used to justify the use of military force against those who aided the 2001 attack and \u201cthe continuing threat posed by Iraq.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s allies have cited national security risks posed by Russia to justify procuring Greenland.",
      "Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News last week that Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland is about \u201cthe Arctic.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have Russia that is trying to become king of the Arctic with 60-plus icebreakers, some of them nuclear-powered,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "During an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Vice President-elect JD Vance said America does not need to use military force to secure Greenland but that the U.S. needs to make sure that Greenland is \u201cproperly cared for from an American security perspective.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think there actually is a real opportunity here for us to take leadership, to protect America\u2019s security, to ensure that those incredible natural resources are developed,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what Donald Trump is good at. He\u2019s good at making deals, and I think there\u2019s a deal to be made in Greenland.\u201d",
      "On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Lankford also said for the first time that he planned to vote in favor of Trump\u2019s pick for director of national intelligence, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.",
      "When asked if he was a yes on Gabbard, Lankford told moderator Kristen Welker, \u201cI am,\u201d suggesting he was convinced by Gabbard\u2019s newfound support for Section 702, an intelligence gathering tool that she consistently opposed while in Congress.",
      "\u201cThat was a very important piece for me. Obviously, she voted against 702 authority. ... But when she came out and said, \u2018Hey, this is something I\u2019m going to stand for,\u2019 that\u2019s part of the role of the Office of National Intelligence, is to make sure we\u2019re actually watching for people to come attack us and stopping them before they do,\u201d Lankford said."

      "\u201cThe gangs didn\u2019t take over in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was gradual. They worked on your mind first. They started kidnapping people in 2021, and I had to keep leaving my house to stay with my family. Eventually, it wasn\u2019t safe for me or my mom anymore.\u201d",
      "The mother and daughter spent two years shuttling between their home and staying with family members outside of Port-au-Prince. As the violence escalated, they fled Haiti. After a tumultuous escape, Dolcine and her mother came to the United States under the Biden administration\u2019s Humanitarian Parole Program, which currently creates a legal pathway for temporary visas for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Eligible individuals are granted permission to stay in the country for up to two years, allowing them also work. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including passing security screenings, and are required to have a U.S.-based sponsor.

      "On the campaign trail, Trump announced plans to launch an unprecedented deportation initiative targeting undocumented criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers. During a NewsNation interview, Trump also mentioned his intention to end programs like Temporary Protected Status, which is set to expire in 2026 and would need to be renewed.\u00a0The program has been adopted by administrations going back to George H.W. Bush.",
      "However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services emphasizes that potential beneficiaries of the program undergo rigorous background checks to ensure they pose no security threat to the U.S. Trump\u2019s team did not specifically address the impact of these plans on Haitian migrants when reached by NBC News.",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela  \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn in Friday to serve a third six-year term, extending his increasingly repressive rule until 2031 despite protests and credible evidence that his opponent won the election.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s legislative palace, where he was sworn in and delivered a fiery speech, was heavily guarded by police, military and intelligence officers. Crowds of people, many sporting pro-Maduro T-shirts, gathered in adjacent streets and a nearby plaza.",
      "Maduro accused the opposition of trying to turn his inauguration into a \u201cworld war,\u201d and said the faction\u2019s failure to stop the inauguration was \u201ca great Venezuelan victory.\u201d He accused external powers of \u201cattacking\u201d Venezuela, specifically the U.S. government, and promised to guarantee \u201cpeace and national sovereignty.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday more than ever I feel the weight of commitment, the power that I represent, the power that the constitution grants me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America.\u201d",
      "The opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of electronic voting machines following the July 28 election, posted the tallies online and said they show Gonz\u00e1lez won twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election on the government\u2019s invitation, declared the opposition-published tallies legitimate. Other election experts that the government allowed to witness the vote said polling records posted online by the opposition appear to exhibit all of the original security features.",
      "On Friday, the European Union imposed sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials who had a role in the country\u2019s 2024 election, including the president and vice president of Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, the electoral agency and others. The 27-nation bloc said those officials have put the nation\u2019s democracy at risk. The U.S. Treasury Department also slapped a new round of sanctions on Venezuelan officials, including the president of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, Maduro\u2019s transportation minister and state-owned airline, among others.",
      "On Thursday, as hundreds of anti-Maduro protesters took to the streets of the capital, Caracas, aides to opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she was briefly detained by security forces and coerced into recording videos.",
      "The popular former lawmaker, whom the government has barred from running for office, had emerged from months of hiding to join the rally to demand Gonz\u00e1lez be sworn in instead of Maduro.",
      "Machado addressed the rally then left on a motorcycle with her security convoy. Machado\u2019s press team later announced on social media that security forces \u201cviolently intercepted\u201d her convoy. Her aides confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner was detained.",
      "Leaders in the Americas and Europe condemned the government for suppressing opposition voices and demanded her release. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his support for Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "\u201cThese freedom fighters should not be harmed, and MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Maduro\u2019s supporters denied that Machado was arrested, saying government opponents were spreading fake news to generate an international crisis.",
      "The brouhaha ahead of Maduro\u2019s inauguration added to the litany of allegations of electoral fraud and brutal repression to silence dissent.",
      "Electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28, but unlike in previous presidential elections, they did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country\u2019s high court \u2014 also filled with allies of his United Socialist Party of Venezuela \u2014 to audit the election results. The court reaffirmed Maduro\u2019s victory without providing thorough evidence and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But neither the council nor the ruling party produced any evidence that Maduro had won, even though their voting center representatives also were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine.",
      "The dispute over the results prompted international outrage and nationwide protests. The government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 demonstrators and encouraging Venezuelans to report anyone they suspect to be a ruling-party adversary.
