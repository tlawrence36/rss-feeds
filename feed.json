      "K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Two things can be true at once. K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture, and it has long been undercelebrated at institutions like the Grammys \u2014 where K-pop artists have performed but have never taken home a trophy.",
      "That could change at next month's 2026 Grammy Awards ceremony. Songs released by K-pop artists \u2014 or K-pop-adjacent artists, more on that later \u2014 have received nominations in the big four categories for the first time. Ros\u00e9, perhaps best known as one-fourth of the juggernaut girl group Blackpink, is the first K-pop artist to ever receive a nomination in the record of the year field for \u201cAPT.,\u201d her megahit with Grammys' favorite Bruno Mars.",
      "The song of the year category also features K-pop nominees for the first time. \u201cAPT.\u201d will go head-to-head with the fictional girl group HUNTR/X's \u201cGolden,\u201d performed by Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami from the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack.",
      "And the girl group Katseye, the brain child of HYBE \u2014 the entertainment company behind K-pop sensation BTS and countless other international acts \u2014 fashioned in the image of the K-pop idol system, has been nominated for best new artist.",
      "It depends on who you ask.",
      "Areum Jeong, assistant professor of Korean Studies at Arizona State University and author of \u201cK-pop Fandom: Performing Deokhu from the 1990s to Today\u201d says the majority of these nominations strike her more as \u201ca de-territorialized, hybrid idea of K-pop,\u201d instead of a recognition of K-pop.",
      "While Ros\u00e9 \u201cwas recruited and trained under the K-pop system, and while \u2018APT.\u2019 does contain some motifs from the Korean drinking game,\u201d Jeong says, \u201cthe song does not feel like a localized K-pop production. \u2026 Same with Katseye, who was trained and produced under HYBE but marketed more toward Western fans and listeners.\u201d",
      "Jeong says that both \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye's \u201cGabriela\u201d \u2014 both of which will go head-to-head with \u201cGolden\u201d in the pop duo/group performance category \u2014 \u201cseem less K-pop than other K-pop songs that could have been nominated over the years.\u201d",
      "She argues the same is true for the music of \u201cKpop Demon Hunters.\u201d \u201cIt is very similar to \u2018APT.\u2019 in that it takes inspiration and motif from Korean culture,\u201d where \u201cK-pop serves as an idea, a jumping-off point, or a motif, creating alternatives or new possibilities.\u201d",
      "Mathieu Berbiguier, a visiting assistant professor in Korean Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, points out that these nominations differ from past K-pop Grammy nominations because \u201cGolden,\u201d \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye all feature \u201ca mainstream popular music factor.\u201d",
      "That's the connection of a massive popular Netflix film (\u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d), a collaboration with Bruno Mars (\u201cAPT.\u201d), and Katseye's international membership and Netflix series (\u201cPop Star Academy: Katseye\u201d), respectively.",
      "\u201cIt tells you that K-pop is not considered as something niche anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, when we think about pop music in general, we also think of K-pop as part of it.\u201d",
      "Bernie Cho, industry expert and president of the South Korean agency, the DFSB Kollective, agrees that there is an international, mainstream appeal to the nominees.",
      "\u201cAll the nominees represent a sort of post-idol K-pop, in the sense that Ros\u00e9, the three ladies of HUNTR/X and Katseye represent the globalized version of K-pop, where the \u2018K\u2019 is very much there, but some people might argue it\u2019s silent. The songs are not necessarily for Korea, by Korea, from Korea, just kind of beyond Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration and testament to how diverse and dynamic K-pop has become.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the Recording Academy has snubbed K-pop acts that have set record-breaking standards, such as BTS,Seventeen and Stray Kids,\u201d argues Jeong. \u201cI think one of the main reasons is that the Western world is still so resistant to non-English lyrics.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does not surprise me that \u2018APT.\u2019 and Katseye\u2019s music, which mainly contain English lyrics and seem less K-pop, were nominated,\u201d she continues.",

Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says many critics and industry voices found 2025 to be a lackluster year for new pop music in the U.S. \u2014 a fact that was all but confirmed in Luminate's 2025 Mid-Year Report, which found that streams of new music had slowed compared to the year prior, potentially due to a dearth of megahits dominating the charts.",
      "\u201cYes, it's a big moment for K-pop, but it is so overdue, these recognitions are more of a sign of how poorly the music industry in the U.S. did this year that we're looking externally,\u201d she says.",
      "She argues that acknowledgment of Korean entertainment from U.S. entertainment industries is more symbolic of U.S. cultural dominance slipping than \u201cK-pop being really good, because K-pop has been really good for a really long time,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is all recognition of just global storytelling improvement, global taste-making improvement.\u201d",

      "\u201cYes and no,\u201d offers Herman. For her, it depends on an evolving and fluid definition of K-pop. After all, HUNTR/X is a fictional girl group from an animated film that did not debut through the K-pop music industry system. Would a victory for their song \u201cGolden\u201d mean a victory of K-pop? That's a matter of opinion.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is returning to a New York court",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein returns to court Thursday, seeking to get his latest sex crime conviction thrown out because anger and apprehensions flared among jurors during deliberations last spring.",
      "It's the latest convoluted turn in the former Hollywood honcho's path through the criminal justice system. His landmark #MeToo-era case has spanned seven years, trials in two states, a reversal in one and a retrial that came to a messy end in New York last year. Weinstein was convicted of forcing oral sex on one woman, acquitted of forcibly performing oral sex on another, and the jury didn't decide on a rape charge involving a third woman \u2014 a charge prosecutors vowed to retry yet again.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denies all the charges. They were one outgrowth of a stack of sexual harassment and sex assault allegations against him that emerged publicly in 2017 and ensuing years, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Early on, Weinstein apologized for \u201cthe way I've behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d while also denying that he ever had non-consensual sex.",
      "At trial, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the women willingly accepted his advances in hopes of getting work in various capacities in show business, then falsely accused him to net settlement funds and attention.",
      "The split verdict last June came after multiple jurors took the unusual step of asking to brief the judge on behind-the-scenes tensions.",
      "In a series of exchanges partly in open court, one juror complained that others were \u201cshunning\u201d one of the panel members; the foreperson alluded to jurors \u201cpushing people\u201d verbally and talking about Weinstein's \u201cpast\u201d in a way the juror thought improper; yet a third juror opined that discussions were \u201cgoing well.\u201d The foreperson later came forward again to complain to the judge about being pressured to change his mind, then said he feared for his safety because a fellow panelist had said he would \u201csee me outside.\u201d The foreperson eventually refused to continue deliberating.",
      "In court, Judge Curtis Farber cited the secrecy of ongoing deliberations and reminded jurors not to disclose \u201cthe content or tenor\u201d of them. Since the trial, Weinstein's lawyers have talked with the first juror who openly complained and with another who didn't.",
      "In sworn statements, the two said they didn't believe Weinstein was guilty, but had given in because of other jurors' verbal aggression.",

      "Weinstein's lawyers contend the tensions amounted to threats that poisoned the process, and that the judge didn't look into them enough before denying the defense's repeated requests for a mistrial. Weinstein's attorneys are asking him to discard the conviction or, at least, conduct a hearing about the jury strains.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the judge was presented with claims about \u201cscattered instances of contentious interactions\u201d and handled them appropriately. Jurors' later sworn statements are belied, prosecutors say, by other comments from one of the same jury members. He told the media right after the trial that there \u201cwas just high tension\u201d in the group.",
      "Prosecutors also said the foreperson\u2019s concerns about discussions of Weinstein\u2019s past were vague and the topic wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits. Testimony covered, for example, 2017 media reports about decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.",
      "The judge is expected to respond Thursday. He could set the conviction aside, order a hearing or let the verdict stand without any further action. Whatever he decides could be appealed.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they're prepared to retry Weinstein on the rape charge the jury couldn't decide last spring. Currently being held in New York, he also is appealing a rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d a based-on-a-true-tale hostage thriller that\u2019s as deeply 1970s as it is contemporary.",
      "In February 1977, Tony Kiritsis walked into the Meridian Mortgage Company in downtown Indianapolis and took one of its executives, Dick Hall, hostage. Kiritsis held a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall's head and draped a wire around his neck that connected to the gun. If he moved too much, he would die.",
      "The subsequent standoff moved to Kiritsis\u2019 apartment and eventually concluded in a live televised news conference. The whole ordeal received some renewed attention in a 2022 podcast dramatization starring Jon Hamm.",
      "But in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Kiritsis, these events are vividly brought to life by Van Sant. It\u2019s been seven years since Van Sant directed, following 2018\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot,\u201d and one of the prevailing takeaways of his new film is that that\u2019s too long of a break for a filmmaker of Van Sant's caliber.",
      "Working from a script by Austin Kolodney, the filmmaker of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d turns \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d into not a period-piece time capsule but a bracingly relevant drama of outrage and inequality. Tony feels aggrieved by his mortgage company over a land deal the bank, he claims, blocked. We\u2019re never given many specifics, but at the same time, there\u2019s little doubt in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d that Tony\u2019s cause is just. His means might be desperate and abhorrent, but the movie is very definitely on his side.",
      "That\u2019s owed significantly to Skarsg\u00e5rd, who gives one of his finest and least adorned performances. While best known for films like \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cNosferatu,\u201d here Skarsg\u00e5rd has little more than some green polyester and a very \u201970s mustache to alter his looks. The straightforward, jittery intensity of his performance propels \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "Yet Van Sant\u2019s film aspires to be a larger ensemble drama, which it only partially succeeds at. Tony\u2019s plight is far from a solitary one, as numerous threads suggest in Kolodney\u2019s fast-paced script. First and foremost is Colman Domingo as a local DJ named Fred Temple. (If ever there were an actor suited, with a smooth baritone, to play a \u201970s radio DJ, it\u2019s Domingo.) Tony, a fan, calls Fred to air his demands. But it\u2019s not just a media outlet for him. Fred touts himself as \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d",

      "Something similar could be said of Tony, who rapidly emerges as a kind of folk hero. As much as he tortures his hostage (a very good Dacre Montgomery), he\u2019s kind to the police officers surrounding him. And as he and Dick spend more time together, Dick emerges as a kind of victim, himself. It\u2019s his father\u2019s bank, and when Tony gets M.L. Hall (Al Pacino) on the phone, he sounds painfully insensitive, sooner ready to sacrifice his son than acknowledge any wrongdoing.",
      "Pacino\u2019s presence in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d is a nod to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d a movie that may be far better \u2014 but, then again, that\u2019s true of most films in comparison to Sidney Lumet\u2019s unsurpassed 1975 classic. Still, Van Sant\u2019s film bears some of the same rage and disillusionment with the meatgrinder of capitalism as \u201cDog Day.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a telling, if not entirely successful subplot of a local TV news reporter (Myha\u2019la) struggling against stereotypes. Even when she gets the goods on the unspooling news story, the way her producer says to \u201cchop it up\u201d and put it on air makes it clear: Whatever Tony is rebelling against, it\u2019s him, not his plight, that will be served up on a prime-time plate.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take recent similar cases of national fascination, such as Luigi Mangione, charged with killing a healthcare executive, to see contemporary echoes of Kiritsis' tale. The real story is more complicated and less metaphor-ready, of course, than the movie, which detracts some from the film's gritty sense of verisimilitude. Staying closer to the truth might have produced a more dynamic movie.",
      "But \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d still works. In the film, Tony\u2019s demands are $5 million and an apology. It's clear the latter means more to him than the money. The tragedy in \u201cDead Man's Wire\u201d is just how elusive \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can be.",

      "When we first glimpse Noah Wyle\u2019s Michael Robinavitch \u2014 aka Dr. Robby, of course \u2014 in Season 2 of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d he\u2019s looking darned good, truth be told. The beloved ER doc is riding his motorcycle to work, wearing nice shades, hair rustling in the early-morning Pittsburgh breeze.",
      "Wait \u2014 hair rustling? It\u2019s only then we notice what\u2019s missing. Can it be that Robby \u2014 dedicated, wise, overworked, charming and brilliant \u2014 isn\u2019t wearing a helmet?",
      "It\u2019s such a jarring sight that, launching a Zoom interview with Wyle, it\u2019s one of the first things we must inquire about. Did we remember that right? Were we supposed to notice?",
      "Yes and yes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to notice that he doesn\u2019t wear it,\u201d Wyle confirms. \u201cBut then, he tells people that he does. Which means, you know he\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s lying about.\u201d",
      "More broadly, it\u2019s all part of the goal this new season, after an impactful, Emmy-winning debut that culminated with a mass shooting. There were worries that they wouldn\u2019t be able to up the ante. Well, the idea is not to up the ante, Wyle says, but to more deeply explore characters and their issues.",
      "\u201cOur job isn't to come up with another stunt that creates drama to be the catalyst for excitement on the show,\u201d Wyle says. \u201cOur job is to be faithful to the characters that we\u2019ve initiated. To plot them in space and time in a real three-dimensional way, and allow their lives and what they\u2019re going through to generate the drama and the tension.\u201d",
      "Hence the no-helmet scene \u2014 a last-minute decision the night before. They'd planned for Robby to wear a helmet. But Wyle says he suggested to executive producer John Wells that if he didn\u2019t, \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to trust and what not to trust from that moment forward, and the audience will be privy to a secret that the characters around him aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe dug it, so we went with that.\u201d",
      "The timing \u2013 July 4 \u2013 was hardly chosen haphazardly. Think holiday gatherings, fireworks, injuries we can imagine and worse ones we can\u2019t. But also, timing is important for the characters \u2014 it's been 10 months since last season's events.",
      "Dr. Frank Langdon has spent those months in rehab. The hard-driving senior resident with the much-noticed dimpled chin ran into serious trouble in the first season when he was caught stealing prescription meds to feed his addiction.",
      "Well, Frank\u2019s been given a reprieve, and he\u2019s on his first day back. Robby, for one, is not thrilled.",
      "But Patrick Ball, who plays Frank, is very relieved at his own reprieve. He'd been biting his nails as he awaited his character\u2019s fate.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden Globes are fast approaching, and Nikki Glaser is struggling to find a Julia Roberts joke.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been the toughest nut to crack,\u201d Glaser, who's hosting Sunday's Globes, said Tuesday with a determined laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to crack it.\u201d",
      "The comedian got the hosting gig last year after showing her skill at ruthlessly roasting celebrities. She got raves for her monologue. She brought out the knives, but they weren\u2019t overly sharp. She was promptly asked back.",
      "Sunday's monologue will be a shape-shifting monster until the moment the CBS telecast starts and she takes the stage at the Beverly Hilton, ideally with a bit ready for Roberts, who's nominated for best actress in a drama for \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d She'll be sitting in front of Glaser with her star-powered charm.",
      "\u201cI just want to do the perfect joke but it\u2019s like people do not have a sense of humor about Julia Roberts,\u201d Glaser said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine \u2014 other people are not fine on her behalf. Like the most innocent joke about her that I made a couple times trying it out, they booed, they were like jeering.\u201d",
      "For others, Glaser is confident in her material, and their ability to take it, including the men in the absurdly star-studded best actor categories:",
      "\u2014 She\u2019ll get another shot at Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, nominated last year for playing Bob Dylan and this year for \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d: \u201cTimoth\u00e9e, he\u2019s great.

      "The tally of 221-205 was a key test before passage of the bill, which is expected Thursday. And it came about because four GOP centrist lawmakers joined with Democrats in signing a so-called discharge petition to force the vote. After last year's government shutdown failed to resolve the issue, they said doing nothing was not an option as many of their constituents faced soaring health insurance premiums beginning this month.",

The action of forcing a vote has been an affront to Johnson and GOP leaders, who essentially lost control of their House majority as the renegade lawmakers joined Democrats for the workaround.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Former President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday temporarily left a prison in Brazil's capital, where he's serving a 27-year sentence for a coup attempt, for medical examinations in a local hospital after he fell from his bed.",
      "Police escorted the 70-year-old Bolsonaro from the federal police's headquarters in Brasilia to the nearby DF Star hospital where he arrived at around midday for three brain tests.",
      "At around 4:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT), Bolsonaro's wife Michelle said on Instagram that the exams had been carried out and that they were awaiting results. Her husband went back to prison, she said.",
      "Bolsonaro fell in his cell overnight from Monday to Tuesday while sleeping. His wife, and Bolsonaro's son Carlos, said on social media Tuesday that the far-right politician needed medical attention and expressed frustration that Bolsonaro wasn\u2019t sent to the hospital the day after his fall.",
      "In his decision authorizing the trip to the hospital Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes cited a health report conducted by the federal police on Tuesday. Bolsonaro reported mild head trauma, according to the report. Upon examination, the former Brazilian leader was found to be conscious and lucid, with a superficial cut to his face.",
      "De Moraes authorized a tomography, brain scan and a brain wave test requested by Bolsonaro\u2019s lawyers. The Supreme Court justice said that his transfer to the hospital should be conducted in a \u201cdiscreet manner,\u201d and that federal police were responsible for Bolsonaro\u2019s security and his return to prison.",

      "The changes comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising.",

They said there was no new science that warranted the changes, including no signs that the former U.S. vaccine schedule harmed children.",
      "Dr. Sean O'Leary of the AAP said the changes could increase child illness and death from preventable disease. He voiced special concern that the U.S. would no longer recommend flu vaccine for children, just as the flu season is becoming severe and after last winter's particularly harsh season.",

While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "It's not yet clear. Because of the countering recommendations from pediatricians, doctor visits may not change. However, medical specialists say when the U.S. government doesn't explicitly recommend a shot, it will raise questions among parents, leading to more difficult conversations at the doctor's office.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",

In another sign of the revived optimism around Milei's reforms, his government issued a dollar bond for the first time in eight years last month, presaging a return to international bond markets.",

In a speech that touched on threats to religious freedom and the Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to abortion and surrogacy, Leo lamented how the United Nations and multilateralism as a whole were increasingly under threat.",
      "\u201cA diplomacy that promotes dialogue and seeks consensus among all parties is being replaced by a diplomacy based on force, by either individuals or groups of allies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe principle established after the Second World War, which prohibited nations from using force to violate the borders of others, has been completely undermined.\u201d",

      "BEIJING -- A week in which longtime tensions between neighbors China and Japan ratcheted up economically and politically drew to a close with no sign of improvements Friday as the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo rebuffed his host nation and the Japanese reported delayed shipments to suppliers in China because of the spat.",

      "\u201cNew militarism will lead Japan back into the abyss,\u201d it said in an editorial. \u201cHistory serves as a stark warning, yet the Japanese right wing is repeating its old tricks.\u201d",

China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed. It staged large-scale military exercises nearby late last month.",
      "On Thursday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan said it had rejected a petition from Japan's Foreign Ministry to retract the new export controls on \u201cdual-use items\u201d that the Japanese military might be able to use in weaponry. The ambassador, Wu Jianghao, insisted that China's move was \u201centirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful\u201d \u2014 and vital to national security.",
      "Also Friday, Japanese officials said they are closely watching if Japanese exports of agricultural, fisheries and other goods are appropriately handled by China without delays. The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that outgoing shipments of sake and processed food from Japan to China were being held up because of the diplomatic tensions, widening the ripples of the dispute.",
      "Officials at the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization told The Associated Press that the shipments had been delayed in customs on the China side starting in late November.

      "The protests also represented the first test of whether the Iranian public could be swayed by Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A massive crowd of mostly barefoot Filipino Catholics joined an annual procession of a centuries-old statue of Jesus Christ in the Philippine capital Friday, with some using the gathering to express outrage over a corruption scandal involving influential legislators.",
      "After a midnight mass joined by tens of thousands of worshippers at a seaside park in Manila, the wooden Jesus the Nazarene statue was placed on a four-wheel open carriage before dawn at the start of the procession that Manila Mayor Isko Moreno claimed could draw millions of devotees throughout the day and into the late night.",
      "One of Asia\u2019s major religious spectacles, the often-raucous procession of the life-size statue meanders through nearly six kilometers (3.7 miles) of Manila\u2019s congested narrow roads near the heavily guarded presidential palace. The procession is also a security nightmare for the authorities.",
      "About 15,000 police officers, backed by intelligence agents, were deployed to keep order. Authorities imposed a gun and liquor ban, prohibited drones and backpacks, and jammed cellphone signals along the route of the procession.",
      "First-aid tents manned by government and Red Cross medics were set up throughout the route, where more than 250 worshippers were treated for bruises and sprains by midday. An hour before the procession started, a Filipino photographer collapsed on a nearby sidewalk and appeared to be having difficulty breathing. He died while being brought to a hospital by medics, according to officials and two Associated Press journalists, who tried to assist the photographer.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of devotees, many wearing maroon shirts imprinted with images of the Nazarene, jostled and scrambled to get near the carriage carrying the statue by mid-morning. Many tried to climb up the carriage or threw small towels at volunteers on the carriage to wipe parts of the cross and the statue, in the belief that the Nazarene\u2019 figure would cure ailments and help provide good health, jobs and a better life.",
      "This year\u2019s Nazarene procession coincided with growing public outrage over a major corruption scandal, which erupted last year and implicated dozens of members of the House of Representative and the Senate who allegedly received huge kickbacks from construction companies. The scandal involved thousands of substandard or non-existent flood control projects across an archipelago that is prone to some of the deadliest flash floods in Asia.",
      "Several government engineers and construction company executives have been detained while facing corruption trials. Many Filipinos have expressed frustration over the delay implementing President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s vow to have legislators accused of wrongdoing locked up in jail by last Christmas.",
      "As they marched, large numbers of worshippers repeatedly chanted: \u201cjail them now, jail them now.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn our country today, there are those who refuse to step down even though they made mistakes and got caught, even though they are causing hardship to the people, even though the poor are suffering, even though the country is being flooded and destroyed,\u201d Sescon said. \u201cEnough is enough. Have mercy on the people. Have some shame. Step down voluntarily in the name of mercy and love;\u201d",
      "Venus Lopez, a 62-year-old devotee, who carried a replica of the Nazarene statue, made a similar call.",
      "\u201cI hope those corrupt government officials will go away. They don\u2019t deserve to be seated in power,\u201d Lopez told The Associated Press and added that she would pray to the Nazarene to help banish corrupt officials from government.",
      "The life-size statue, crowned with thorns and bearing a cross, is believed to have been brought from Mexico to Manila on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship that carried it caught fire, but the charred statue survived. Some believe the statue\u2019s endurance, from fires and earthquakes through the centuries, and intense bombings during World War II, is a testament to what they say are mystical powers.",
      "The spectacle reflects the unique brand of Catholicism, which includes folk superstitions, in Asia\u2019s largest Catholic nation. Dozens of Filipinos have themselves nailed to crosses on Good Friday in another tradition to emulate Christ\u2019s suffering that draws huge crowds each year.",

      "Jaylord Antigua, a 31-year-old office worker in the landfill, said the collapse of the mountain of garbage unfolded rapidly without warning and in good weather.

      "The Mexican government reports a sharp decline in homicide rates, claiming its security strategy is working",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican government boasted Thursday a sharp decline in homicide rates, presenting the figures as evidence that its security strategy is working, while analysts cautioned that the numbers may not fully reflect the country\u2019s violence.",
      "During President Claudia Sheinbaum's daily news conference, officials said Mexico recorded 17.5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2025, the lowest rate since 2016.",
      "That compares with 29 killings per 100,000 people in 2018, when homicides reached their highest level in two decades.",
      "Sheinbaum, of the leftist Morena party, said homicides dropped 40% between September 2024 \u2014 the month before she took office \u2014 and December 2025.",
      "\u201cThis means 34 fewer homicides every day, and it is the lowest figure since 2016,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "She attributed the decline to a strategy based on coordination among security forces, justice institutions, prosecutors\u2019 offices and state governors.",
      "However, Mexico's public security secretariat has not yet published data of the whole 2025 homicide figures and neither has the Statistics Institute, which releases data annually that is considered more reliable because it is based on death certificates but is published after a monthslong delay.",
      "Mexico\u2019s homicide rate began rising sharply in 2006, following the launch of a military-led campaign against drug cartels under then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of the conservative PAN party.",
      "Killings kept rising from then and peaked during the administration of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who governed from 2018 to 2024 and backed Sheinbaum's candidacy.",
      "After taking office on Oct. 1, 2024, Sheinbaum hardened the government\u2019s security approach amid pressure from the United States, moving away from L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy and prioritizing intelligence work and interagency coordination.",
      "Lisa S\u00e1nchez, director of the nongovernmental organization Mexico United Against Crime, said homicides are down, but she cautioned that not all of the necessary data is available to make meaningful comparisons. \u201cWe don't know how they're compiled and handled,\u201d she said.",

It came on the third anniversary of the riots led by Bolsonaro's supporters that destroyed government buildings and helped build the case against the former president.",
      "The Senate passed the bill in December. Brazil\u2019 s Congress could override Lula\u2019s veto, but analysts say that could be a risky move for lawmakers ahead of next October\u2019s general elections.

It is victory against those who tried to seize power through force, ignoring popular will expressed in the polls.\u201d",
      "Lula narrowly won his third term against Bolsonaro, who was later ruled ineligible to run until 2030 for abuse of power during the campaign trail. In November the former president started serving for his attempted coup conviction, extending that deadline for the 70-year-old leader until 2033. There are other cases pending against him.",

      "His rise in Cambodia was meteoric. Chen had said that he started with a loan from an uncle in the real estate business. He founded Prince Group in 2015, and the group built up Sihanoukville from a sleepy Cambodian beach town into a larger community that came to be known as a gambling and scam hub, according to Radio Free Asia.",
      "But Chen's Prince Group has long been on the radar of authorities both in the U.S. and in China for their alleged illegal activities.",
      "Court documents in China show Prince Group is mentioned in at least a dozen judgments, mostly concerned with money laundering and online gambling. Gambling is outlawed in mainland China and allowed only in Macau, a special administrative region.",
      "Prosecutors in the western Chinese province of Sichuan sentenced 45 people to jail in a case for setting up illegal online gambling, where they said Chen had worked with Prince Group to set up an online gambling business targeting Chinese nationals as early as 2016. The group set up subsidiary companies in Cambodia's Sihanoukville, Phnom Penh and Chrey Thum, according to the statement from Wangcang County court.",

      "In the United States, federal prosecutors in October unsealed an indictment against Chen for defrauding Americans and victims across the world of billions. By this time, he held passports from China, Cambodia, Vanuatu, Cyprus and St. Lucia, according to the indictment.",
      "Chen also personally managed the scam compounds and maintained records that tracked the profits from \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams, the Chinese term for the illegal practice, the prosecutors said.",

      "\u201cThis agreement is destined to boost our exports, with the goal of reaching 700 billion euros in exports,\" Tajani wrote in a post on X. He acknowledged the deal required a long negotiation, but added that Italy had secured protections for its farmers, \"especially regarding production standards.\u201d",
      "Meloni said at a press conference on Friday she never had \u201cany ideological objections\u201d to the Mercosur agreement.",
      "\"We have always said we will be in favor of it when there are sufficient guarantees for our farmers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe agreement\u2019s potential is good, but not at the expense of the excellence of our products.\u201d",

Dozens of people have been killed and thousands arrested as the daily protests have grown and the government seeks to contain them.

The protests have intensified steadily since beginning Dec. 28.",
      "The protests also represented the first test of whether the Iranian public could be swayed by Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Pahlavi, who called for the protests Thursday night, similarly has called for demonstrations at 8 p.m. Friday.",

      "Toilet paper, a product that is used for a few seconds before being disposed of forever, is typically made with trees, energy-intensive manufacturing processes and chemicals that can pollute the environment.",
      "Experts say more consumers are seeking toilet paper made from recycled content or sustainable materials, but it can be hard to know what to look for.",
      "Sustainable toilet paper often costs more, but can have significant environmental benefits. According to the Environmental Paper Network, a coalition of nonprofits, more than 1 billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of water and 1.6 million trees could be saved if every American used one roll of toilet paper made from recycled content instead of a roll made from forest fibers.",
      "Here are some recommendations for buying sustainable toilet paper or reducing overall toilet paper use.",
      "North American toilet paper has traditionally been made from fibers from trees in Canada and eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Pulp made from the trees is bleached to create a bright white color, but the chlorine that's often used can hurt the environment. Large amounts of electricity and heat are used to remove moisture and form square sheets.",
      "Increasingly, manufacturers are making toilet paper from recycled paper products, which avoids material from freshly cut trees, and are using chlorine-free bleaching techniques. Once used, toilet paper itself is flushed and not recycled.",
      "Looking for recycled content is a good place for environmentally conscious consumers to start, said Gary Bull, professor emeritus of forest economics at the University of British Columbia. Preconsumer materials include scrap materials from manufacturing or unsold paper. Postconsumer materials come from paper products that have already been used.",
      "Making toilet paper from postconsumer recycled fibers improves its sustainability because paper is \u201cone of the easiest materials on the planet to recycle,\u201d Bull said.",
      "The best way for a scientist to evaluate the carbon footprint of an item is doing a life cycle assessment, which calculates the environmental impacts from when a tree is a seedling to when its fibers are converted into toilet paper and flushed down the drain, Bull said. But that method isn't within reach of consumers, so advocates have undertaken third-party assessments.",
      "Some companies add those labels to packaging to show that their processes have been vetted. Bull said labels on bath tissue from the Forest Stewardship Council or the Sustainable Forestry Initiative indicate the company is making scientifically-proven efforts to be sustainable. Both groups' standards include conserving water, wildlife, and biodiversity as well as compliance with applicable forestry laws to keep ecosystems healthy.",
      "The nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council also publishes an annual report that grades toilet papers from A+ to F, with the highest-ranked products being unbleached or bleached without chlorine, containing recycled content and avoiding harmful forestry practices. Aria, Green Forest, Natural Value, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods 365 100% Recycled received the highest letter grade in 2025, with all made entirely from recycled materials.",
      "The \u201cThe Issue with Tissue\u201d report was launched in 2019, and NRDC corporate campaign advocate Ashley Jordan said she has noticed dozens of sustainable toilet paper brands have emerged over the last six years.",

      "\u201cIf more people are buying sustainable toilet paper and demanding it, there should be economies of scale and prices should fall to match that of conventional toilet paper,\u201d he said.",
      "Mark Pitts, executive director of tissue at the American Forest & Paper Association, whose members include large toilet paper manufacturers such as Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Georgia-Pacific, told The Associated Press that sustainability is a core industry focus and members have reported reductions of greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain. He said that members follow responsible forestry practices and have increased their use of recycled material.",
      "Alternative materials such as fast-growing bamboo are often billed as more sustainable than toilet paper made from trees, but consumers should focus on toilet paper made with recycled materials instead, said Ronalds Gonzalez, an associate professor at North Carolina State University and expert on fibers used in the hygiene industry.",
      "Gonzalez said pollution from manufacturing processes can reduce the benefits of using bamboo. Gonzalez recently co-authored a study that found bamboo toilet paper made in China that is available in the U.S. had a higher environmental impact than toilet paper made in the U.S. with imported forest fibers, largely because Chinese manufacturers use electricity generated by coal. The study found the bamboo toilet paper\u2019s environmental impacts could be reduced when it was produced in regions that use renewable energy.",

      "Spanish league president Javier Tebas told The Associated Press in an email that Cloudflare is an organization \u201cfully aware that a significant share of sports audiovisual piracy relies on its infrastructure and, despite this knowledge, it continues to protect and monetize that activity, as recognized by courts in multiple jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Tebas said that in Spain alone, more than 35% of La Liga's content piracy continues to be distributed through Cloudflare\u2019s infrastructure, despite thousands of formal notices and judicially backed enforcement measures implemented by Internet service providers.",
      "\"This is not a legal, technical or ideological debate, but a case of a company prioritizing its commercial interests and financial gain over the law, the sustainability of the global sports industry, and the protection of its own customers, whom it uses as a digital shield for organized piracy networks,\u201d Tebas said.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Protests in Iran sparked by economic woes have now gone nationwide in the Islamic Republic, activists said Thursday, signaling both their staying power and intensity as they challenge the country's theocracy.",
      "Wednesday saw the most-intense day of demonstrations, reaching rural towns and major cities in every province though still localized enough for daily life to continue in Tehran, Iran's capital, and elsewhere. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations. But any intensification may seem them act.",
      "Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,\u201d wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran.",
      "\u201cThere may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country\u2019s potential transformational leaders.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah.",
      "Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.",
      "Demonstrations continued Thursday, with merchants closing their shops in Iran\u2019s Kurdistan province.",
      "It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s warned last week that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d America \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments drew a new rebuke from Iran's Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cRecalling the long history of criminal interventions by successive U.S. administrations in Iran\u2019s internal affairs, the Foreign Ministry considers claims of concern for the great Iranian nation to be hypocritical, aimed at deceiving public opinion and covering up the numerous crimes committed against Iranians,\u201d it said.",

      "The demonstrations so far broadly appear to be leaderless, like other rounds of protests in Iran in recent years. However, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah, has urged the public in Iran to shout from their windows and roofs on Thursday and Friday nights at 8 p.m. (1630 GMT).",
      "\u201cWherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time,\u201d Pahlavi said in an online video that's also been promoted by Iranian satellite news channels abroad. \u201cBased on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.\u201d",
      "Whether people take part will be a sign of possible support for Pahlavi, whose support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December.",

      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests.",
      "This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab.",

      "China and Japan \u2014 frenemies, trading partners and uneasy neighbors with a tortured, bloody history they still struggle to navigate \u2014 are freshly at each other\u2019s rhetorical throats as 2026 begins. And it\u2019s over the same sticking points that have kept them resentful and suspicious for many decades: Japan\u2019s occupation of parts of China in the 20th century, the use of military power in East Asia, economics and politics \u2014 and, of course, pride.",
      "From insinuations that Chinese citizens face dangers in Japan to outright accusations of resurgent Japanese imperialism, this first week of the year in China has been marked by the communist government scorning Tokyo on multiple fronts and noticeably embracing the visiting leader of another crucial strategic neighbor: South Korea.",
      "The latest chapter in Japan-China enmity surged In November when Japan's new leader waded into choppy bilateral waters. She said, in effect, that if China moved militarily against Taiwan, she wouldn't rule out involving Japan's constitutionally defense-only military. That didn't go over well in Beijing, which has teed off on Tokyo over the years for far less.",
      "\u201cPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s erroneous remarks concerning Taiwan infringe upon China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, blatantly interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, and send a military threat against China,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday, a week after military exercises around the island ended. \u201cWe urge Japan to face up to the root causes of the issue, reflect and correct its mistakes.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s hardly uncommon language. China frequently demands Japan ponder the path it has taken and correct its \u201cerroneous\u201d course. It's rhetoric, sure, but it goes far deeper. And sometimes it's hard to tell what's real umbrage and what's ginned up for domestic political consumption.",
      "Because when it comes to the China-Japan relationship, anger remains a powerful and enduring tool on both sides. And there's no indication that's going away anytime soon.",
      "From the time Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895 after a war with Qing Dynasty China, a deep suspicion and at times outright enmity has existed between the two countries.",
      "It worsened in the 1920s and 1930s after Japan\u2019s brutal occupation of parts of China resulted in torture and deaths that Chinese resent to this day. At the same time, Japanese leaders have sometimes thrown incendiary political footballs like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese who gave their lives in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 including some war criminals from the Sino-Japanese wars. China, like clockwork, responds with indignation.",
      "Japan lost World War II to the Allied powers and relinquished offensive military powers under a U.S.-drafted constitution, even as the current communist Chinese government was establishing the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. Since then, any hint of Japanese military assertiveness has drawn great umbrage here. Disputes over territory, such as an island chain called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spike occasionally.",
      "The enmity, pulled out when something is perceived as aggressive or anger is required for a domestic audience, lurks barely beneath the surface, ready to pop. Even today, cartoons circulate online in China depicting Japanese as demonic, aggressive and anti-China.",
      "This week has been an illuminating case study.",
      "On Tuesday, China slapped restrictions on \u201cdual-use exports\u201d to Japan \u2014 anything, it said, that Japan could adapt for military use. Though it didn't specify what the ban includes, anything from drones to rare earths could be considered dual-use. The lack of specificity allows China to adjust its approach as it goes \u2014 making it more or less strict depending on where the political winds are blowing.",
      "Japan demanded the move be rescinded. \u201cThese measures, which only target Japan, deviate significantly from international practice,\u201d its Foreign Ministry said, calling China's actions \u201cabsolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d This came days after it protested Chinese mobile drilling rigs in the East China Sea.",

      "\u201cJapan has never been able to fully eliminate the scourge of militarism in the country,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Japan's right-wing forces are left free to develop powerful offensive weapons, or even possess nuclear weapons, it will again bring disaster to the world.\u201d",
      "Also part of the equation this week: China's visible pivot to another regional neighbor, South Korea, whose president spent four days in Beijing. Seoul has a bumpy history of its own with Japanese aggression and also sporadic \u2014 though generally less intense \u2014 friction with Beijing, a longtime supporter and ally of its rival North Korea.",
      "Chinese media gave splashy coverage to Lee Jae Myung's visit, touting new Beijing-Seoul agreements on trade, environmental protection and transportation \u2014 and notably technology, given the dual-export ban. Also visible: Lee at two business events watching major companies pledge increased collaboration. The sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.",
      "The burst of official affection toward South Korea didn't stop with Lee. While he was here, Chinese media reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from the mainland over New Year\u2019s. That's on top of Beijing's recent efforts to discourage Chinese from traveling to Japan, citing \u201csignificant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens\u201d there.",
      "For now, Japan-China tension remains a matter of rhetoric and policy. But no one is predicting a quick resolution. With Japan's staunch ally, the United States, planning to furnish more arms to Taiwan in a single sale than ever before, there's too much at stake for both East Asian nations at this moment \u2014 and too much contentious history \u2014 for an easy and quick solution.",
      "\"This time ... de-escalation and a return to the status quo may not be as easily achieved,\" Sebastian Maslow, an East Asia specialist and associate professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo, wrote in The Conversation last month. \u201cWith diplomatic channels in short supply and domestic political agendas paramount, an off-ramp for the current dispute is not in sight.\u201d",

      "State lawmakers and governors will have decisions to make in 2026 about the budgets for their biggest social safety net programs",
      "States have major decisions to make in 2026 about the social safety net and taxes in the aftermath of a sweeping law President Donald Trump signed last year.",
      "The federal government is shifting more responsibilities to states over the next few years, and states must prepare for greater costs in the Medicaid health care and SNAP food aid programs. They also must decide whether to offset upcoming federal funding cuts with state tax dollars. And they must weigh whether to cut state taxes on tips, overtime wages and other items to remain in line with Trump's big bill.",
      "Though most states still have ample rainy day funds, the extra burdens are coming as many states face their tightest budgets since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big storm coming for state budgets \u2014 the radar is clear \u2014 and it\u2019s going to hit almost every state,\u201d said Tim Storey, CEO of the National Conference of State Legislatures. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean some hard choices.\u201d",
      "In most states, those determinations will begin in January, when legislatures convene and governors lay out their agendas.",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is used by 42 million Americans to help buy groceries, is going to become more expensive for states to run and harder for some people to qualify for assistance.",
      "Currently, the federal government picks up the full cost of benefits \u2014 around $94 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September 2024 \u2014 and splits the administrative costs with the states, which run the program. The federal share of administrative costs for 2024 was about $6 billion.",
      "Starting Oct. 1, states will have to pay three-fourths of the cost to run the program. And starting in late 2027, some states that make errors in more than 6% of payments \u2014 often for paying a household more than it's supposed to get after its income rises \u2014 will have to start paying some of the costs of benefits.",
      "California already has allocated $84 million to try to reduce SNAP errors, plus additional money to help counties implement other new requirements.",
      "The shift in administrative costs could come to around $50 million a year in Florida, said Sky Beard, the Florida director for No Kid Hungry. Paying for some SNAP benefits, if the state is forced to, could be in the neighborhood of $1 billion a year. She said that\u2019s a reason lawmakers have a lot of questions about the details of error rates.",
      "Other states are weighing whether to put more money into SNAP.",
      "New Jersey Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat, said the state has an obligation to help people access health care and food. But he said the magnitude of federal cuts \u2014 as much as a $36 billion reduction for New Jersey over the next decade for Medicaid alone, according to KFF, an organization that researches health policy \u2014 could make it hard to keep all the state\u2019s social programs unchanged.",
      "\u201cWhat there will be is a commitment to doing our level best to make sure that all of the people\u2019s needs get covered,\u201d Coughlin said.",
      "The federal law signed by Trump imposes work requirements for some adults on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. Most states must start those work mandates by January 2027, which means they must be accounted for in their next state budgets.",
      "But states can start sooner if they desire.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced that his state will launch Medicaid work requirements in May. The Republican said the state could handle the change without hiring more government employees and that the work mandate \u201ccan have a gigantic impact in helping lift people up.\u201d",

      "But many states face tens of millions of dollars of costs merely to prepare for the new Medicaid requirements.",
      "The Missouri Department of Social Services has requested about $33 million in the next budget for technology improvements needed to comply with Medicaid work checks and more frequent eligibility reviews. It's seeking more than $12 million to hire the equivalent of about 120 people to carry out the tasks.",
      "The work requirement applies to people with slightly higher incomes who are eligible for Medicaid under a voluntary expansion included in President Barack Obama's 2010 health insurance overhaul. Forty states and the District of Columbia took up the offer. The states that didn't agree to the expansion all have legislatures controlled by Republicans.",
      "The work requirement is the biggest piece in a series of Medicaid changes that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts will reduce Medicaid spending by $911 billion through 2034 and leave 10 million more Americans uninsured over that time frame.",
      "States could respond by narrowing who is eligible for Medicaid, as the District of Columbia did in a policy that kicked in Jan 1. Or they could follow Colorado and Idaho and cut Medicaid reimbursements to medical providers.",
      "Liz Williams, who analyzes Medicaid at KFF, said home care, dental benefits and coverage of GLP-1 drugs often used for weight loss, also could face restrictions in some states.",
      "Some changes are expected to hit rural hospitals especially hard. The federal law seeks to partly offset that by spending $50 billion over the next five years. States will have to decide how to use their share of that money.",
      "The federal law temporarily halts federal income taxes on tips and overtime pay, provides new tax deductions for seniors and some people with auto loans, and enacts numerous new corporate tax breaks.",
      "States can decide whether to incorporate those tax cuts into their own income tax codes.",
      "Some states have income tax laws that automatically conform with changes to federal tax laws. But officials in other states have to decide whether to link up \u2014 and whether to do so partially or fully.",
      "Michigan is the only state so far to vote to opt in to the tax breaks on tips and overtime. Those provisions automatically carry over to state income taxes in about a half-dozen other states.",
      "Officials in Arizona are among those planning to conform to the federal tax cuts when their legislative session begins in January. Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs said embracing the tax breaks can help \u201cease the cost of living crisis\u201d and provide certainty to taxpayers. Republican legislative leaders say they stand ready to give their approval.",

      "Reserve guard Jordan Miller made his first six shots and added 21 points. John Collins had 16 for the Clippers, who bounced back from their loss to the New York Knicks on Wednesday to win for the eighth time in 10 games. Leonard, questionable earlier in the day with a sprained right ankle, started slowly but had 19 points in the second half.",
      "Rookie guard Egor Demin scored 19 points for the Nets, who lost on a buzzer-beater in overtime against Orlando on Wednesday. But it was quickly clear this one would never be close.",
      "Michael Porter Jr. struggled to 18 points, missing all nine 3-point attempts.",
      "The Clippers scored the first eight points, and after Nic Claxton made two free throws, Harden scored the next six in an 8-0 run that made it 16-2. Demin made a 3-pointer to snap Brooklyn's 0-for-8 start, but then Leonard and Harden scored to make the Clippers 8 for 9 and give them a 21-5 lead.",

      "The Nets, playing four of their five first-round draft picks, often had at least one rookie on the floor and it appeared Harden was looking to punish any of them who had to guard him. The three-time NBA scoring champion shot 10 for 13, and when the Nets started sending a second defender at him, he found the open man and finished with six assists.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Trae Young's tan outfit nearly matched the color of Washington's uniforms. And although he couldn't take the court and help his new team, Wizards fans showed their appreciation.",
      "Young was introduced to the home crowd with a video during the first quarter of Friday night's 128-107 loss to New Orleans. Earlier in the day, the trade that sent the high-scoring guard from Atlanta to Washington became official, and now Young can look forward to a fresh start after leaving the Hawks.",
      "\"For me, DC is overlooked as far as a big market,\" Young said. \u201cIn the NBA, I feel like this is a big market, and I just feel like I'm going to be able to come into an opportunity to be myself.\u201d",
      "The first big question is when Young will play again. He missed Friday night\u2019s game with knee and quadriceps issues and hasn\u2019t appeared in a game since Dec. 27.",
      "Big market or not, the Wizards lost 64 games last season and 67 in 2023-24. They were 3-20 around mid-December but had won seven of their last 13 entering Friday night\u2019s game. Washington has plenty of young players, and the development of second-year big man Alex Sarr has been encouraging, but the Wizards could use a true point guard to play alongside the likes of Bub Carrington, Bilal Coulibaly, Tre Johnson and Kyshawn George, all of whom are between 6-foot-4 and 6-foot-8 and under 23 years old.",
      "Enter the 27-year-old Young, who for his career has averaged 25.2 points per game and 9.8 assists. After the Wizards spent two seasons bottoming out, his arrival gives Washington fans a star they can pin their hopes on. General manager Will Dawkins suggested the move won't alter the patience the team has shown with its less experienced players.",
      "\u201cAs an organization, we have a long-term plan, and we're not going to do anything to deviate from that,\u201d Dawkins said. \u201cI think Trae fits into what we're trying to do based on the development of a lot of the younger players.\u201d",
      "Washington could lose its first-round pick this year if it falls outside the top eight, but aside from that, there was little obvious downside to bringing in a four-time All-Star like Young, especially since the Wizards gave up no draft choices in the trade. Washington sent guard CJ McCollum, who coincidentally has the same birthday as Young but is seven years older, to Atlanta along with reserve forward Corey Kispert.",
      "Young has a player option for about $49 million for next season.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a four-time All-Star, All-NBA player available, who wants to come to DC and help make it what we want it to be, it was an easy partnership and an easy decision,\u201d Dawkins said.",
      "Although he led the Hawks to the conference finals back in 2021, Atlanta hasn't even made the playoffs the past two seasons, and the light return for Young indicates where his stock was when the deal was made.",

      "The \u201creminder\u201d from the College Sports Commission came out about an hour before kickoff of the semifinal between Indiana and Oregon in a College Football Playoff that has shared headlines with news of players signing seven-figure deals to move or, in some cases, stay where they are.",

      "The CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.",
      "The CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.",
      "One high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington.",

      "Sean Payton acknowledges the Denver Broncos need to improve their offense despite recent wins",
      "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Yes, Sean Payton would prefer to blame the Denver Broncos' stagnant offense on facing two backup quarterbacks whose teams were intent on keeping Bo Nix from running up the score.",
      "\u201cYeah, I'd like to say that, but honestly, you guys know me well enough, we're going to have to play better,\u201d the Broncos head coach said Friday after a spirited practice he compared to OTA days with the starters squaring off.",
      "After losing 34-20 to Jacksonville at home on Dec. 21, snapping their 11-game winning streak, the Broncos won at Arrowhead Stadium for the first time since 2015 when they beat the Chiefs and their third-string quarterback 20-13 on Christmas night.",
      "With Justin Herbert and several of his teammates sitting out Week 18, the Broncos beat the Los Angeles Chargers 19-3 but didn't score an offensive touchdown, going 0 for 3 in the red zone.",
      "Still, those two victories helped secure the top overall seed in the AFC playoffs and the lone first-round bye that comes with it. They'll face the lowest remaining seed after wild-card weekend in the divisional round next week.",
      "The popular narrative around Broncos Country is that Payton held back over the last two weeks with conservative calls and vanilla gameplans so as not to show anything to opponents heading into the postseason.",
      "\u201cI'd love to say that we pulled a bunch back, but the tape from last week wasn't really good offensively,\u201d Payton said. \u201cWasn't great in Kansas City, either. It was good enough to win that game. But no, we've got to be sharper. As we get to these next games here we're going to see good teams that can score and we're going to see (stingy) defenses.\u201d",
      "That's why the Broncos didn't just go through the motions Friday when they reconvened after a 72-hour break to rest their minds and bodies following a 14-3 season.",
      "\u201cI said to them, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t want to go out and just fill in today, or just fill in time. I'm going to be honest with you, our third-down numbers bother me on each side of the ball,'\" Payton recounted. \"We can improve in that area.",
      "\u201cThese games are going to come down to the 2-minute. I want those to be competitive, all right? And then I really want to work our red zone offense and defense.\u201d",
      "So, the Broncos didn't practice with the Chargers, Steelers, Texans or Bills in mind \u2014 those are the four teams they could face first in the divisional round \u2014 but were focused on execution and effort.",

      "Payton is of the mindset that the biggest benefit to having the top seed is having to win just two games to reach the Super Bowl instead of three. Still, the rest and four days off were much needed and appreciated.",
      "\u201cIt was good,\u201d right tackle Mike McGlinchey said. \u201cIt was great to get rest and be able to chill out and enjoy some family time this week. My wife and I are about 2 1/2 weeks away from our second (child), so it's nice. We're nesting a little bit. But, no, it was good. Got the body right, get some treatment, get some workouts in during the week and then today was good, clean, get to kind of knock the rust off, get some long individual work in and then compete a little bit.\u201d",
      "McGlinchey concurred with his coach that the film review was uncomfortable and chock full of caveats.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, the obvious thing is executing in the red zone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou've got to turn field goals into touchdowns and that's how you win games, especially this late in the year and especially as you go through the playoffs. Got to be better on third down \u2014 by being better on first and second down. ... We've just go to clean up details and we'll be fine.\"",
      "After another similar practice Saturday, the Broncos will return to work either Monday or Tuesday, depending on when their first game is.",

      "NOTES: Payton said he expected ILB Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) to return during the playoffs, but added he wasn't ready to make a prediction about the return of RB J.K. Dobbins from Lisfranc foot surgery.",

      "In the Thursday report, researchers from Microsoft said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world\u2019s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the previous three months.",
      "Yet the divide of AI adoption in developed and developing countries is widening, the report noted, with AI adoption across advanced economies growing nearly twice as fast as developing nations.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,\u201d said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist for Microsoft's AI for Good Lab, which used anonymized \u201ctelemetry\u201d to help track global device usage.",
      "Countries that invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure and AI led in terms of shares of users, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain, according to the report. Some of Microsoft's figures overlapped with the findings of a Pew Research Center survey published in October that mapped which countries are more excited than concerned about AI. In both reports, for instance, South Korea stood out in its embrace of AI.",
      "Microsoft has a vested interest in AI adoption \u2014 its business and much of the tech industry and stock market is staking its future on AI tools becoming more widely used and profitable \u2014 but Lavista Ferres said his lab is looking more broadly at the topic.",
      "His researchers found that the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which was founded in 2023, has fueled wider AI adoption across the developing world given its free and \u201copen source\u201d models \u2013 with key components available for anyone to access and modify.",
      "When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning AI model called R1 in January 2025, which it said was more cost-effective than OpenAI\u2019s similar model, it raised eyebrows in the global technology industry and many were surprised by how China is catching up with the U.S. in technological advancements. Leading science journal Nature published peer-reviewed research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng in September, describing it as a \u201clandmark paper\u201d from the Chinese startup.",
      "Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek is a \u201cgood model\u201d for tasks like math or coding, but it operates differently from U.S.-based models on topics like politics.",
      "\u201cWe have observed that for certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means that there will be questions that will be answered very differently, particularly political questions. In many ways that can have an influence on the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek offers a free\u2011to\u2011use chatbot on web and mobile, and has also given developers global access to modify and build on its core engine. Its lack of subscription fees has \"lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price\u2011sensitive regions,\u201d Microsoft's report said.",

      "Developed countries including Australia, Germany and the U.S. have sought to limit the use of DeepSeek over alleged security risks. Microsoft last year banned its own employees from using DeepSeek. Adoption of DeepSeek remained low in North America and Europe, the report found, but it surged in its home country China, as well as Russia, Iran, Cuba, Belarus \u2013 places where U.S. services face restrictions or where foreign tech access is limited.",
      "In many places, DeepSeek\u2019s prevalence correlated with it being a default chatbot on widely available phones made by Chinese tech companies like Huawei.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s market share in China was 89%, the report estimated. That\u2019s followed by Belarus\u2019s 56% and Cuba\u2019s 49%, both of which also had low AI adoption more broadly. In Russia, its market share was around 43%.",
      "In Syria and Iran, DeepSeek\u2019s market share reached around 23% and 25%, respectively, the report added. In many African countries including Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Niger, DeepSeek\u2019s market share was between 11% to 14%.",
      "\u201cOpen\u2011source AI can function as a geopolitical instrument, extending Chinese influence in areas where Western platforms cannot easily operate,\u201d the report said.",

      "The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.",
      "Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.",

      "At that point, Musk began to suspect that Altman and another OpenAI executive, Greg Brockman, might be plotting to transform the research lab into a profit-seeking company, according to evidence submitted to the the judge.",
      "Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.",
      "A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.",
      "In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.",
      "One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",

      "He said it is too early to tell if Mayon\u2019s restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.",
      "Troops, police and disaster-mitigation personnel helped evacuate more than 2,800 villagers from 729 households inside a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius from the volcano\u2019s crater that officials have long designated a permanent danger zone, demarcated by concrete warning signs, Albay provincial officials said.",

      "As CES opened Tuesday to the public, auto and tech companies like Nvidia and Gentex showed how AI technology can transform cars into proactive companions that adapt and react to drivers and passengers in real time",
      "LAS VEGAS -- In a vision of the near future shared at CES, a girl slides into the back seat of her parents' car and the cabin instantly comes alive. The vehicle recognizes her, knows it\u2019s her birthday and cues up her favorite song without a word spoken.",
      "\u201cThink of the car as having a soul and being an extension of your family,\u201d Sri Subramanian, Nvidia's global head of generative AI for automotive, said Tuesday.",
      "Subramanian's example, shared with a CES audience on the show's opening day in Las Vegas, illustrates the growing sophistication of AI-powered in-cabin systems and the expanding scope of personal data that smart vehicles may collect, retain and use to shape the driving experience.",
      "Across the show floor, the car emerged less as a machine and more as a companion as automakers and tech companies showcased vehicles that can adapt to drivers and passengers in real time \u2014 from tracking heart rates and emotions to alerting if a baby or young child is accidentally left in the car.",

      "Unlike smartphones or online platforms, cars have only recently become major repositories of personal data, Brookman said. As a result, the industry is still trying to establish the \u201crules of the road\u201d for what automakers and tech companies are allowed to do with driver data.",
      "That uncertainty is compounded by the uniquely personal nature of cars, Brookman said.

      "LONDON -- Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is facing a backlash from governments around the world after a recent surge in sexualized images of women and children generated without consent by the artificial intelligence-powered tool.",
      "On Tuesday, Britain's top technology official demanded that Musk's social media platform X take urgent action while a Polish lawmaker cited it as a reason to enact digital safety laws.",

      "Rising alarm from disparate nations points to the nightmarish potential of nudification apps that use artificial intelligence to generate sexually explicit deepfake images.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look:",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. As of Tuesday, Grok users could still generate images of women using requests such as, \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "Nonprofit group AI Forensics said in a report that it analyzed 20,000 images generated by Grok between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1 and found that 2% depicted a person who appeared to be 18 or younger, including 30 of young or very young women or girls, in bikinis or transparent clothes.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, responded to a request for comment with the automated response, \u201cLegacy Media Lies\u201d.",
      "However, X did not deny that the troublesome content generated through Grok exists. Yet it still claimed in a post on its Safety account, that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, \u201cby removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "The platform also repeated a comment from Musk, who said, \u201cAnyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d",
      "A growing list of countries are demanding that Musk does more to rein in explicit or abusive content.",
      "X must \u201curgently\u201d deal with the problem, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Tuesday, adding that she supported additional scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom.",

      "Under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, social media platforms must prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it.",

      "The Paris prosecutor's office said it's widening an ongoing investigation of X to include sexually explicit deepfakes after officials received complaints from lawmakers.",
      "Three government ministers alerted prosecutors to \u201cmanifestly illegal content\" generated by Grok and posted on X, according to a government statement last week.",
      "The government also flagged problems with country's communications regulator over possible breaches of the EU's Digital Services Act.",
      "\u201cThe internet is neither a lawless zone nor a zone of impunity: sexual offenses committed online constitute criminal offenses in their own right and fall fully under the law, just as those committed offline,\u201d the government said.",
      "The Indian government on Friday issued an ultimatum to X, demanding that it take down all \u201cunlawful content\" and take action against offending users. The country's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also ordered the company to review Grok's \"technical and governance framework\" and file a report on actions taken.",
      "The ministry accused Grok of \u201cgross misuse\u201d of AI and serious failures of its safeguards and enforcement by allowing the generation and sharing of \u201dobscene images or videos of women in derogatory or vulgar manner in order to indecently denigrate them.\"",
      "The ministry warned failure to comply by the 72-hour deadline would expose the company to bigger legal problems, but the deadline passed with no public update from India.",
      "The Malaysian communications watchdog said Saturday it was investigating X users who violated laws prohibiting spreading \u201cgrossly offensive, obscene or indecent content.\u201d",
      "The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said it's also investigating online harms on X, and would summon a company representative.",
      "The watchdog said it took note of public complaints about X's AI tools being used to digitally manipulate \u201cimages of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, or otherwise harmful content.\u201d",
      "Lawmaker Erika Hilton said she reported Grok and X to the Brazilian federal public prosecutor\u2019s office and the country's data protection watchdog.",
      "In a social media post, she accused both of of generating, then publishing sexualized images of women and children without consent.",
      "She said X's AI functions should be disabled until an investigation has been carried out.",
      "Hilton, one of Brazil's first transgender lawmakers, decried how users could get Grok to digitally alter any published photo, including \u201cswapping the clothes of women and girls for bikinis or making them suggestive and erotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe right to one\u2019s image is individual; it cannot be transferred through the \u2018terms of use\u2019 of a social network, and the mass distribution of child porn(asterisk)gr(asterisk)phy by an artificial intelligence integrated into a social network crosses all boundaries,\" she said.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",
      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

      "The Trump Organization didn't respond to inquiries from The Associated Press about the delays or when the device is now expected to be shipped. The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer service representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.",
      "Whatever the reason, the T1's ongoing absence from the smartphone market didn't come as a surprise to International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo.",
      "\u201cWe have always been quite skeptical about this phone,\u201d Jeronimo said. \u201cThey are probably finding that it is harder to build a phone than they thought it would be. Let's see if this thing comes to life or not.\u201d",
      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "Before the May conclave that elected Leo, cardinals had complained about Francis\u2019 go-it-alone governing style and called for the new pope to convene regular consistories so the cardinals could gather as a group and advise the pope on pressing issues facing the church.",

      "Anger and outrage are spilling out onto Minneapolis\u2019 streets over the fatal shooting of a woman the day before by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- As anger and outrage spilled out onto Minneapolis\u2019 streets Thursday over the fatal shooting of a woman the day before by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, a new shooting by federal officers in Oregon left two people wounded and elicited more scrutiny of enforcement operations across the U.S.",
      "Hundreds of people protesting the shooting of Renee Good marched in freezing rain at night down one of Minneapolis\u2019 major thoroughfares, chanting \u201cICE out now\u201d and holding signs saying, \u201ckiller ice off our streets.\" Protesters earlier vented their outrage outside a federal facility that is serving as a hub for the administration\u2019s latest immigration crackdown on a major city.",
      "The shooting in Portland, Oregon, took place outside a hospital in the afternoon. A man and woman were shot inside a vehicle, and their conditions were not immediately known. The FBI and the Oregon Department of Justice were investigating. Mayor Keith Wilson and the city council called on ICE to end all operations in the city until a full investigation is completed.",
      "Just as it did following the Minneapolis shooting, the Department of Homeland Security defended the actions of the officers in Portland, saying the incident occurred after a Venezuelan man with alleged gang ties and who was involved in a recent shooting tried to \u201cweaponize\u201d his vehicle to hit the officers. It was not yet clear if witness video corroborates that account.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump and others in his administration have repeatedly characterized the Minneapolis shooting as an act of self-defense and cast Good as a villain, suggesting she used her vehicle as a weapon to attack the officer who shot her.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said the shooting was justified and Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was a \u201cvictim of left-wing ideology.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can believe that her death is a tragedy while also recognizing that it is a tragedy of her own making,\u201d Vance said, noting that the officer who killed her was injured while making an arrest last June.",
      "But state and local officials and protesters rejected that characterization, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying video recordings show the self-defense argument is \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "The shooting happened on the second day of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which Homeland Security said is the biggest immigration enforcement operation ever. More than 2,000 officers are taking part, and Noem said they have made more than 1,500 arrests.",
      "It provoked an immediate response in the city where police killed George Floyd in 2020, with hundreds of people turning up to the scene to vent their outrage at the ICE officers and the school district canceling classes for the rest of the week as a precaution.",
      "Good\u2019s death \u2014 at least the fifth tied to immigration sweeps since Trump took office \u2014 has resonated far beyond Minneapolis, as protests took place or were expected this week in many large U.S. cities.",
      "\u201cWe should be horrified,\u201d protester Shanta Hejmadi said. \u201cWe should be saddened that our government is waging war on our citizens.\u201d",
      "Protesters blocked the street where Good was shot with makeshift barricades constructed out of garbage cans, Christmas trees and canopies. People gave out coffee and water, while fires burned in metal drums to keep visitors warm.",
      "The Minnesota agency that investigates officer-involved shootings said Thursday that it was informed that the FBI and U.S. Justice Department would not work with the it, effectively ending any role for the state to determine if crimes were committed. Noem said the state has no jurisdiction.",
      "\u201cWithout complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,\u201d said Drew Evans, head of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.",
      "Gov. Tim Walz demanded that the state be allowed to take part, repeatedly emphasizing that it would be \u201cvery difficult for Minnesotans\u201d to accept that an investigation excluding the state could be fair.",

      "The push is driven by politics. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, the Republican who leads the state Senate, has made eliminating income taxes a centerpiece of his 2026 campaign for governor. State Sen. Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican who led a committee to abolish the tax, is among candidates to succeed Jones as lieutenant governor.",
      "\u201cThis is the first vote that we are going to get to take to address affordability,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal will pass. Georgia House Republicans may want to continue nibbling away at the tax in smaller bites, preferring a \u201cmeasured\u201d approach. Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington said Wednesday that his big 2026 goal is to eliminate property taxes for homeowners, but said he's willing to consider the Senate plan.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, serving his last year, has been cool to total elimination of the income tax. He declined to comment Wednesday on the Senate plan, but spokesperson Carter Chapman said Kemp wants \"to continue lowering taxes and putting more money in Georgians\u2019 pockets as he has throughout his term.\u201d",
      "The state's Democratic minority opposes the move, saying it would mostly benefit high earners and the state needs money to provide services.",
      "Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri have all set goals to abolish the personal income tax, joining eight other states that don't tax personal income. Eight other states besides Georgia are cutting personal income tax rates this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., group generally skeptical of higher taxes.",
      "\u201cWe've seen a lot of states cut their income tax rates in the last four or five years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and coming out of it,\u201d said Aravind Boddupalli, senior researcher at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C.",
      "Supporters say cuts help a state compete for new residents and businesses, pointing to growth in Texas and Florida, two states without personal income taxes.",
      "\u201cYour income tax is a tax on productivity,\u201d said Manish Bhatt, who studies state taxes for the Tax Foundation. \u201cIf you are taxing productivity, you are potentially losing out on economic gains.\u201d",
      "Georgia has already been cutting income taxes, taking what was once a top income tax rate of 6% and lowering it to a 5.19% flat rate. Republicans broadly support a further cut for individual and corporate taxpayers to 4.99% this year, worth an estimated $800 million in foregone tax revenue.",
      "The Senate plan would then freeze the corporate rate and focus on individual tax cuts. It proposes in 2027 to exempt the first $50,000 of income for a single person or $100,000 for a married couple, up from $12,000 and $24,000 now.",
      "Faced with Democratic criticism about affordability, the big increase in exempt income is central to Republicans' own arguments about how they can make money stretch farther. About 70% of Georgians reported less than $100,000 of taxable income in 2024, according to state figures.",

      "\u201cIt is a plan that gives benefits first to hardworking families,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "The initial rate cut, plus the exemption proposal, would lower Georgia revenue by $3.8 billion in its 2027 budget year. Tillery says the state could pay by using surplus tax revenue and shifting back to paying for capital expenditures through borrowing instead of cash. But those moves probably wouldn't cover the foregone revenue even in the first year, much less $13 billion more in cuts to get to zero.",
      "Tillery said revenue should be bolstered by trimming business income and sales tax breaks, saying legislators should reduce \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d But lawmakers and Kemp have balked at curtailing those measures in recent years.",
      "Tax cuts haven't always been a political bonanza. In Kansas, after Republicans under Gov. Sam Brownback cut income taxes steeply more than a decade ago, voters revolted at budget cuts and lawmakers imposed multiple tax increases to cover persistent budget shortfalls, including restoring some income tax cuts. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won her first term in 2018 by framing the race as a referendum on Brownback\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cState income taxes are only bad if you fundamentally don't believe that the services, the public investments that state governments provide, are worth anything,\u201d said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy .",
      "In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and GOP legislative leaders have made phasing out the state\u2019s income tax a top priority for the session starting Wednesday. They're looking to expand sales taxes to services which currently are untaxed to help offset lost revenue.",
      "\u201cWe want to do this in a smart, efficient way that\u2019s not going to have the state go off some sort of fiscal cliff,\u201d Missouri House Majority Leader Alex Riley told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "But expanding sales taxes could fall more heavily on poorer taxpayers. The liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute estimated that if Georgia doesn't expand its sales tax, the combined state and local sales tax rate would have to rise sharply from the current 7.42% to recover revenue losses.",
      "All that leads to questions about income-tax elimination plans, even from Republicans. Burns, the Georgia House speaker, said he's \u201copen\u201d to any plan that benefits Georgians.",
      "\u201cBut we've got to have the details, and it has to work,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe need to make sure we can continue to do vital services \u2014 health care, public safety, education, all the things we talked about.\u201d",

      "The private deal for \"Action Comics No. 1\" was announced Friday. It eclipses the previous record price for a comic book, set last November when a copy of \"Superman No. 1\u2033 was sold at auction for $9.12 million.",
      "The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.",
      "The comic \u2014 which sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938 \u2014 was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. But over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to \"turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.\"",
      "Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, according to Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect President Vincent Zurzolo.",

It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",

      "\"It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,\" Fishler noted. \"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon \u2014 and that's what Action No. 1 is \u2014 an icon of American pop culture.\"",

      "The announcers named the nominees across all 28 categories, including a brand new slot for Best Podcast. The Golden Globes\u00a0says\u00a0it's the first major award show to honor podcasting. Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, Call Her Daddy, Good Hang with Amy Poehler, The Mel Robbins Podcast, SmartLess and Up First from NPR were nominated for the new category.",

It will honor Mirren, the recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and Parker for the Carol Burnett Award.",
      "\"This is a chance to properly honor those who have so profoundly shaped our culture, with more than a two-minute awards moment.

      "Who's hosting the 2026 Golden Globes?",

      "\"People at home want you to make fun of the A-listers. They want you to make them feel a little uncomfortable. It's covert in the sense that I want to get away with those jokes without just ruining the vibe in the room. It's really strategic, and it's one of the most difficult jobs I've ever had...is picking the perfect jokes,\" she said in a Jan. 6 interview.",
      "For the award show, being \"mean\" is not Glaser's intention. She said she saves that for roasts. When asked if she's run any of her jokes by celebrities in advance, Glaser said not yet, but joked that she'd like Sean Penn's number.",

    "summary": "The innovative pioneer of modern dance is a Kennedy Center Honoree who has been shattering barriers all her life",
    "story": [
      "Countless young dancers have followed in the footsteps of Carmen de Lavallade, the Grande Dame of American dance who's among those receiving Kennedy Center honors in Washington tonight. She's been shattering barriers almost all her life, as Rita Braver now shows us:",
      "The elegant 86-year-old in pink putting young members of the Dance Theatre of Harlem through their paces (\"Lighten up!\") just happens to be one of the pioneers of American Modern Dance: Carmen de Lavallade.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it always that you have hoped that audiences would get from seeing you dance over the years?\"",
      "\"The connection,\" she replied. \"Because I don't feel that I'm there just dancing for myself, you know? I'm dancing for the audience.\"",
      "The remarkable journey of this California bricklayer's daughter is being saluted this weekend with a Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "It's a story that begins when even getting dance lessons was a challenge, as she described in her 2014 one-woman show: \"In those days, there were very few people who would take you if you were colored,\" she recalled. \"And if you did get into a dance studio, the white students would walk out.\"",
      "But her talent triumphed. While still in high school, de Lavallade won a place in a prestigious L.A. dance company. And she didn't go alone. She was joined by a high school friend who turned out to be a pretty good dancer himself: Alvin Ailey.",
      "De Lavallade introduced Ailey to the world of dance, and they were partners for years.",
      "In 1954 they were invited to perform in \"House of Flowers,\" an all-black Broadway show. But it was a cast member from Trinidad who won her heart: Geoffrey Holder. They were married within three months.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it about him that attracted you?\"",
      "\"I must say that he allowed me to be who I am. We didn't get in each other's way.\"",
      "Holder became a Tony Award-winning director (for \"The Wiz\") who often created both dances and costumes for his wife. The mementos of their life together are stored in a cavernous Harlem warehouse. \"I lived with this all my life,\" de Lavallade mused.",
      "Since Holder's death in 2014, de Lavallade  and her son, Leo, have been cataloging every piece -- letters, photos, costumes and clothes -- and recalling the stories that go with them, some of them bittersweet.",
      "In 1961 de Lavallade, by then an international sensation, was to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "But she was not allowed to perform with the white dancer she was working with at the time.",
      "Braver asked, \"How did you feel when you were told that?\"",
      "\"You know, I wasn't surprised,\" she replied. \"It's not like today where, you know, you can get up and do all your protesting. It wasn't like that. You said, 'OK, move on.'\"",
      "And move on she did. She was one of the first black dancers at the Metropolitan Opera, where she also became a choreographer.\u00a0 And she joined the faculty of the Yale School of Drama, where she taught actors how to move.",
      "She is still performing. But she has never forgotten the lessons of history and the injustice she and other Black artists have faced",
      "And so, de Lavallade became one of the Kennedy Center Honorees who announced she would boycott the now-canceled White House reception after President Trump seemed to equate White nationalists who marched in Charlottesville with protesters who opposed them.",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "\"I'm not political,\" she said. \"I have my own way of being political. That's the first time I've ever felt that I ... I just can't.\"",
      "Braver said, \"Some people would say, 'Well, even so, he's our president, and it's just fitting to go.'\"",
      "To which de Lavallade responded, \"I am 86 now. I have all these years, I have done what anybody asked me to, and this is the first time in my life I've ever said no. And I think at this time, it's my privilege.\"",
      "But Carmen de Lavallade will be there at tonight's Kennedy Center gala savoring her award for a life well-danced:",
      "\"I'm glad to think that whatever I did meant something, that really meant something,\" she said. \"That's what I'm pleased about.\"",

    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:41:52 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The number of uninsured will rise by an average of 3.8 million each year from 2026 to 2034 without an extension of the credits, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2024.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an\u00a0extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wegovy-weight-loss-pill-us-novo-nordisk/",
    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:10:25 -0500",
    "summary": "FDA-approved semaglutide drug is the first GLP-1 pill for weight loss available in the U.S., according to drugmaker Novo Nordisk.",
    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:11:22 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

    "title": "Trump says Venezuela stole American oil. Here's what really happened.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-venezuela-oil-assets-theft-explainer/",
    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:13:13 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:46:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issues in the U.S. for comment.",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563.",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "But opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement late Friday: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said it supports Mr. Trump's push to address affordability, but \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "In an open letter to lawmakers last year, the American Bankers Association said it found in a 2020 analysis that 95% of subprime borrowers \u2014 or 65 million accounts \u2014 could lose access to credit cards if interest rates were capped at 15%. The group argued that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" like pawn shops and payday lenders.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

The number of uninsured will rise by an average of 3.8 million each year from 2026 to 2034 without an extension of the credits, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2024.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an\u00a0extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
      "The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region.",
      "The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to secure power from its nuclear plant in Clinton, Illinois.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 50,000 jobs in December, capping a year of muted job growth that saw employers pull back on hiring amid economic uncertainty.",
      "The numbers",
      "The monthly job gains were below the 55,000 forecast by economists, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.",
      "Payroll gains were revised downward for both October and November, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously reported in those months. The U.S. labor market lost 173,000 jobs in October, a larger decline than the earlier reported decline of 105,000 jobs, while November hiring was revised down to 56,000 from 64,000.",
      "\"The labor market has shown continued resiliency, but it's still softening, and the pace of year-to-date overall employment gains has slowed to the dragging pace of growth we saw in 2020,\" said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management, in a Friday email.",
      "In December, hiring was robust in food services and drinking, health care and social assistance, while the retail sector shed jobs, the BLS said.",
      "Most layoffs since 2020",
      "Employers announced 1.2 million job cuts in 2025, a 58% increase from the prior year and the highest level since 2020, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said Thursday.",
      "Job growth slowed throughout 2025 as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring. Employers added a total of roughly 584,000 jobs in 2025, down sharply from more than 2 million the previous year and the weakest annual gain outside a recession since 2003, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Some big corporations, such as Amazon, cut jobs as they sought to rely more on artificial intelligence, while the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency oversaw the reduction of roughly 300,000 government jobs last year, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The headwinds facing the labor market prompted the Federal Reserve to thrice cut its benchmark interest rate late last year, as lowering borrowing costs can help spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to expand.",
      "Prior to the release of Friday's report, EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said he is forecasting hiring will average 25,000 new jobs per month for the first half of 2026, while the unemployment rate could drift up to 4.8%.",
      "What it means",
      "While hiring was weak in 2025, experts don't think the labor market is collapsing.",
      "\"There aren't any red flashing lights indicating an imminent recession, but there are plenty of yellow warning lights flashing, and there is the risk that we could approach stall speed,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a Friday research note.",
      "Payroll gains averaged about 50,000 per month last year, according to BLS\u00a0data, which is the amount the economy requires to maintain a stable labor market, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, which aligns with the December job gains and the average payroll gains throughout 2025.",
      "Interest rate outlook",
      "Signs of stabilization in the labor market \u2014 particularly a lower jobless rate \u2014 could lead the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes on interest rate cuts for now, according to some experts.",
      "\"For this report, all roads lead to the unemployment rate,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, in an email. \"At 4.4%, it simply reads as relief versus 4.6% and it should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining strong hiring while also taming inflation. A weaker labor market picture in 2025 compelled the central bank to cut interest rates three times.",
      "The upshot for 2026, experts say, is that rate cuts are coming, but they may arrive later in the year.",
      "Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an email note that she expects a pause for now, but two cuts at some point this year.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",

      "Avelo Airlines said that it will no longer carry out migrant deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security, ending a contract that supported the U.S. government's immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" an Avelo spokesperson said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"",
      "Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.",
      "DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handled more than half of DHS' charter flights in 2025, according to ICE Flight Monitor at Human Rights First, a group that tracks ICE deportation flights.",
      "\"ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. \"ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "In April, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy expressed confidence that the airline's deportation business would help drive the carrier's growth, while conceding that handling deportation flights was a \"sensitive and complicated topic.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors on Wednesday rejected Paramount Skydance's revised hostile bid, saying that its terms are inferior to Warner's $82.7 billion merger agreement with Netflix.",
      "\"Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders,\" Warner Bros. Discovery's board said in a statement.",
      "The rebuff is the second from Warner Bros. Discovery of Paramount Skydance's efforts to acquire the storied studio, which has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and owns cable networks including CNN and TNT.",
      "Paramount Skydance, the parent company of CBS News, owns the Paramount studios and cable networks including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery in December rebuffed Paramount Skydance's most recent hostile bid, citing a lack of personal backing from the Ellison family.",
      "Paramount Skydance later returned with an improved offer that included a personal guarantee from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison \u2014 the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison \u2014 for $40.4 billion in equity financing.",
      "But on Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery turned down the latest offer as well, stating that Paramount Skydance's bid posed \"significant costs, risks and uncertainties\" compared with the Netflix merger. Warner Bros. Discovery also said Paramount Skydance's offer would burden the combined company with significant debt.",
      "On Thursday, January 8, Paramount Skydance said it is sticking with its current offer, reiterating the company's belief that the bid is \"superior to WBD's existing agreement with Netflix.\"",
      "\"Our offer clearly provides WBD investors greater value and a more certain, expedited path to completion,\" David Ellison said in a statement. \"Throughout this process, we have worked hard for WBD shareholders and remain committed to engaging with them on the merits of our superior bid and advancing our ongoing regulatory review process.\"",
      "Netflix on Wednesday said it \"welcomed\" Warner Bros. Discovery's ongoing commitment to the companies' merger. The streaming service added that it has submitted its Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with U.S. agencies, which is required for a review of potential antitrust issues.",
      "Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO network, as well as its streaming and studios business, for $27.75 a share. Under the deal, Warner's cable division would be spun off into a separately run unit before the merger is completed.",
      "Netflix's bid includes $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50. Paramount Skydance is offering $30 a share to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, valuing the offer at roughly $108 billion.",

      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",

To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section.

This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check set to increase by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis.",
      "2025 tax returns will be impacted by a number of major changes signed into law through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act, which enacted a host of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025.

      "Federal income tax returns are due April 15, although people who need more time can file for an\u00a0automatic tax extension before that. An extension gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file, although any taxes owed must still be paid by April 15 to avoid penalties.",
      "When will you get your refund?",
      "The question on most taxpayers' minds is how long it will take for their refund to be deposited.",
      "That depends on whether a taxpayer files electronically or submits a paper return, as well as whether the IRS identifies any problems with a filing.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:37:13 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in October amid declines in imports of pharmaceuticals and gold.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. trade deficit dropped sharply in October, reaching its lowest level since 2009 as imports dropped under President Trump's sweeping tariffs, according to new government data.",
      "The overall trade gap plunged 39% to $29.4 billion in October, as imports fell by 3.2%, Department of Commerce figures show. The deficit was significantly lower than the $58.4 billion median forecast from surveys of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.",
      "While U.S. exports rose by $7.8 billion in October to $302 billion, imports dropped by $11 billion to $331.4 billion. The U.S. trade deficit in September was $48.1 billion.",
      "\"Swings in trade of gold and pharmaceuticals were behind the plunge in the trade deficit to a two-decade low in October, though higher computer imports suggest there are genuine signs of strength elsewhere in the economy amid the AI buildout,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "The release of the trade data was delayed by more than a month due to a 43-day\u00a0government shutdown last year, depriving officials and companies of updated figures as they assess the health of the world's biggest economy.",
      "The figures underscore how Mr. Trump's volatile and sweeping tariff policies have influenced trade flows. When the president unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on imports from dozens of trading partners, U.S. businesses rushed to stock up on inventory, front-loading imports ahead of planned tariff hikes.",
      "This has allowed many firms to avoid passing on the full cost of tariffs to consumers, keeping price hikes on goods relatively tame.",
      "As U.S. households grapple with an affordability crisis, Mr. Trump has more recently expanded the range of\u00a0goods exempt from tariffs, including key agricultural imports.",
      "As of mid-November, the Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate topping 16%, the highest since the 1930s.",
      "Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, could still be struck down if the Supreme Court rules that Mr. Trump illegally invoked the law to enact tariffs. A ruling is expected as early as Friday.",
      "Depending on how the Supreme Court rules, businesses could be owed billions in refunds for duties they paid on imports last year.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"people live in homes, not corporations,\" in announcing plans to bar big investors from home purchases.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, claiming the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and that action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House declined to provide more information on Mr. Trump's plans for restricting large investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "\"It is an idea that appeals to MAGA populists and is a policy that Vice President J.D. Vance has consistently supported,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, said in a research note. \"That it comes now is an indicator of how worried Team Trump is worried about the impact of housing affordability on the midterm election.\"",
      "Seiberg expects both the House and Senate to pass bipartisan bills to implement Mr. Trump's order. \"We appreciate that many important congressional Republicans have opposed this in the past. Our view is that they will concede on this issue rather than fight the president,\" he added.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",
      "Customers eligible for automatic payments are those who signed up for Prime through what the FTC calls a \"challenged enrollment flow,\" including pages such as Amazon's shipping selection page and its single-page checkout. Consumers who used three or fewer Prime benefits within a 12-month period are also due for refunds without submitting a claim.",
      "Prime benefits include services such as free two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming and Amazon Music.",
      "If you signed up for Prime through a \"challenged enrollment flow\" between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, and you used Prime benefits between three and 10 times in a 12-month period, you may need to file a claim to get money under the settlement.",
      "Eligible customers who need to file a claim will receive an email or a mailed notice, according to the settlement website.",
      "What information do you need to file a claim?",
      "The settlement site says you'll need to provide the requested information, which includes a claim ID and PIN provided in the email or mailing sent to customers. You'll also have to sign and submit the claim before July 21.",
      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",
      "However, some customers may see smaller amounts if, for instance, they signed up for a trial membership that charged less than the regular Prime fee, the site notes.",
      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",
      "Consumers will then have 180 days to submit a claim, and Amazon will review each claim within 30 days of receiving it. Payments should \"follow shortly after approval of your claims form,\" the site adds.",
      "How will the Amazon Prime refunds be issued?",
      "The refunds will be sent through PayPal, Venmo or mailed checks, according to the settlement site. People who file claims can specify their preferred payment method.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-airlines-pilot-jet-panel-blew-out-sues-boeing/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",

    "summary": "A prediction market user won big after wagering $32,000 that the U.S. would capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Was it insider trading?",
    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:36:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Travel insurance won't help most people whose flights were disrupted by the turmoil in Venezuela. Here's what such policies do cover.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of people were stranded abroad because their flights home were scrapped after the U.S. temporarily shut down airspace around Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some travellers remain stuck because airlines rebooked them on flights that don't leave for days, while others face thousands of dollars in extra travel-related expenses, such as lodging costs. Now, industry experts are advising them to ask airlines for refunds and, for those with travel insurance, to file a claim.",
      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

    "summary": "U.S. drivers are likely to see lower prices at the pump this year amid lower global oil prices and strong crude production.",
    "story": [
      "The average price of gas around the U.S. this year is expected to dip to $2.97 per gallon, down 13 cents from 2025 \u2014 that would be the lowest level since 2020, according to a new analysis by GasBuddy.",
      "At the end of 2025, average U.S. prices at the pump\u00a0dipped below $3, with GasBuddy citing strong refinery output, lower oil prices, robust crude production and softer seasonal demand as the main reasons behind the decline.",
      "\"It's not a return to ultra-cheap fuel, but for the first time in a long time, the wind is clearly behind drivers' backs,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a statement.",
      "Expect a rise, then a dip",
      "While prices are expected to average below $3 in 2026, GasBuddy says drivers should expect some volatility throughout the year due to seasonal demand, weather and geopolitical risks.",
      "The company, whose app helps drivers save money on fuel, predicts gas prices will edge up to around $3.20 between spring and early summer before falling to an average of $2.83 after June.",
      "That would mirror normal seasonal fluctuations. Gas prices tend to rise in the spring and fall in the winter, when fuel demand typically weakens.",
      "What will prices be in my state?",
      "To be sure, the price you see at the pump depends on where you live. For example, prices on the Gulf Coast and South are expected to stay well under $3 for the year, while prices in California, the Northeast and cities like Chicago could be higher, according to GasBuddy.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is counting on U.S. oil companies to revive Venezuela's creaky energy production and tap its massive reserves.",
    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",

      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:46:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issues in the U.S. for comment.",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563.",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "But opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement late Friday: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said it supports Mr. Trump's push to address affordability, but \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "In an open letter to lawmakers last year, the American Bankers Association said it found in a 2020 analysis that 95% of subprime borrowers \u2014 or 65 million accounts \u2014 could lose access to credit cards if interest rates were capped at 15%. The group argued that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" like pawn shops and payday lenders.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

      "However, shortly after that report, Mr. Trump announced that he had called off the plan to \"surge\" federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Lurie.",
      "\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 23. The president also noted that \"friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge.\"",
      "\"I told him what I would tell you,\" Lurie said Friday of his October call with Mr. Trump. \"San Francisco is a city on the rise, crime is at historic lows, all economic indicators are on the right direction, and our local law enforcement is doing an incredible job.\"",
      "Going back to the pandemic, San Francisco has often been the strong focus of criticism from Republican lawmakers over its struggles in combatting crime and homelessness. It was voter frustration over those issues that helped Lurie defeat incumbent London Breed in November 2024.",

      "The Justice Department has stopped short of claiming Ross was acting in self-defense.",
      "But in a statement to CBS News this week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that the use of deadly force by law enforcement officials can sometimes be justified.",

      "HHS announced plans to freeze the funding earlier this week. The move would cut off some $7 billion from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, $2.4 billion from the Child Care Development Fund and $870 million in social services grants.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Submaranian on Friday granted a request by the states for a temporary restraining order halting the funding freeze. The order will last for 14 days, while the court considers a request for a longer-term order.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and HHS For comment.",
      "The funding freeze came as the Trump administration alleged pervasive fraud in social programs run by Democratic states \u2014 an issue that was vaulted into national prominence by revelations that hundreds of millions of dollars were bilked from child nutrition, housing and autism programs in Minnesota.",

      "\"The best way to help poor families is to end the fraud so that the money that is available for them. And that's what we're doing,\" Kennedy said.",
      "In a lawsuit against HHS filed in Manhattan federal court, the five states argued the Trump administration's focus on fraud was merely a \"pretext\" to punish Democratic states that are \"disfavored by the Administration.\" They also called the funding freezes an \"extraordinary and cruel\" move that would hamper programs used by needy children and families.",
      "The states alleged that the funding freeze is illegal and unconstitutional. They argued that the federal government can't cut off funding based on \"mere allegations or suspicion of fraud\" without following a legal process that gives states an opportunity to respond to HHS's concerns and appeal the agency's decisions.",
      "Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement Friday he was \"pleased with the court's decision.\"",

      "President Trump urged major energy companies to commit to building out Venezuela's oil infrastructure on Friday, convening a meeting at the White House to call on executives to pour billions of dollars into tapping the country's vast oil reserves.Representatives from Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and more than a dozen other oil and gas firms were on hand for the meeting in the White House East Room, less than a week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a daring raid in Caracas.\u00a0The president has laid out a strategy to sell millions of barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan oil and control the proceeds while building out additional production capacity. The strategy will rely on major investment from American energy companies to revitalize Venezuela's dilapidated oil infrastructure. The president has said he wants U.S. companies to invest $100 billion toward the effort.At the public portion of Friday's meeting, Mr. Trump pressed the assembled executives to act quickly to tap into the \"tremendous wealth\" in the country. He also said the oil companies would have security guarantees to operate in Venezuela.Most of the executives acknowledged the opportunity in the South American country but stopped short of making firm investment commitments, at least in front of cameras.",

The department is also requiring all financial institutions in Hennepin and Ramsey counties to report any overseas transfer of $3,000 or more.",

      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2024, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",

      "A handful of states \u2014 including Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set rules for AI companies, and several other states are considering regulations.

    "summary": "Veteran diplomat tells CBS News Denmark \"ready to cooperate\" on Greenland, and he expects U.S. to abandon \"anachronistic approach of colonialism\" post-Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Denmark's former ambassador to NATO, veteran diplomat Michael Zilmer-Johns, had tough words for the Trump administration as Danish and American officials prepare to discuss the future of the small European nation's semi-autonomous territory of Greenland.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he'll meet Danish officials next week, but he has not specified where or when. While Zlimer-Johns was critical of the Trump administration's stated intention to make the world's largest, strategically located island part of the U.S., he spoke pragmatically and hopefully about the future of the U.S.-Denmark relationship, and the future of the transatlantic NATO alliance that the U.S. has led for decades.",
      "Below are the highlights of CBS News' interview with the Danish diplomat.",
      "CBS News: About all this talk from the White House about taking Greenland, how do you feel?",
      "Michael Zilmer-Johns: Well, I was shocked, like I think almost every Dane and every Greenlander,, because the U.S. has, in our view, everything it needs for its security in Greenland. There's a huge base there. It has the potential to build up. We have a defense agreement specifically about Greenland, with the US dating back to the year 1951.",
      "I'm angry because I think that this is an affront to an ally that has stood up with the U.S. in Afghanistan, in Iraq, all over the world. Wherever they asked us to participate, we did. So I think it's totally ungrateful.",
      "CBS News: The Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, warned if Trump attacked Denmark to take Greenland, it would be the end of NATO. In her words, \"everything stops, including NATO, and thus the security that has been established since the end of the Second World War.\" As Denmark's former top representative to NATO, to what extent do you fear the end of NATO?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I'm worried, but I am still confident that at the end of the day, better counsels will prevail, that we will find some kind of agreement with the Trump administration on Greenland so that NATO can continue as it should. It will be a very different NATO, anyhow, because it's clear that the Americans are withdrawing from Europe and Europe is going to step up. So it will be more European NATO in the future. But hopefully we can keep it together.\"",
      "CBS News: There has been criticism that a potential U.S. use of military force would basically be a NATO member against another NATO member in the nearly 80 years of the existence of this alliance. In your opinion, would the use of U.S. military force trigger Article 5, (my addition: the mutual defense clause that states an attack on one member is an attack on all 32 NATO nations)?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I mean it's of course absurd to have such a situation where two NATO countries would be in a military conflict. If it was an outside power that did this to Denmark, then of course that would trigger Article 5. In a situation where it's the strongest member of NATO that would attack small Denmark, I think that this would be something where NATO could not engage because it's a conflict inside NATO and not between NATO and the foreign power.",
      "I still find it very difficult to imagine that we would see actual fighting between Danish soldiers and Americans. But of course, the Danish soldiers in Greenland have a standing order to defend the territory against any aggression.",
      "But should it happen, then at the end of the day, I think that the Danish government would tell the Danish troops to stand down because, of course, a military conflict between the world's greatest military power and small Denmark, that is an inevitable result.",
      "CBS News: Would an independent Greenland be able to defend itself against security issues, strategic adversaries? Here, China, Russia, as the White House, as President Trump has said?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: Greenland has a population of 60,000 people. It's a huge land mass, the size of most of Western Europe, so of course it could not do that alone. It would need a stronger partner. It could be Denmark, it could be the US, but the Greenlanders themselves have said that if they - and when they should - become independent, they will continue to be a member of NATO.",
      "CBS News: Right after World War II, the United States offered roughly $100 million in gold to buy Greenland from Denmark at that time. Right now, with inflation, that goes up to about $12-13 billion. What do you feel about that number as applied to Greenland in terms of its value?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think the whole principle of selling Greenland is out of the question. That's the thing that could happen in a different age where there were a lot of colonial powers and Greenland was a colony at that time and there were British colonies all over Africa. And we had sold the West Indies Islands to the Americans in 1916. So at that stage, it was not something that would be inconceivable. But today, with the status that Greenland has, it is simply not on the table. So whatever the amount would be, it would never be realistic, or something that anybody in Greenland could imagine.",
      "CBS News: Is the White House being imperial in its ambitions?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think that you could put it that way. When you look at the new security strategy, when you look what President Trump is saying about the Western Hemisphere and the need for control and the needs to expand the U.S., that sounds very much like imperialism in my eye.",
      "Traditionally, America was at the forefront of decolonization and making the Europeans give up their colonies, forcing them to do so or putting pressure to do. I do not think that this approach will continue after President Trump. Even if his MAGA movement or the Republicans should continue to control the White House. I think it's very much Trump's personal approach, this anachronistic approach of colonialism, more imperialism.",
      "CBS News: Is there anything else you would like to add in any talking points? A message for President Trump, a message for Americans?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I would like to say that we are ready to cooperate with America in all aspects of ensuring the legitimate security interests in and around Greenland. And we would invite you to do so. Thank you very much.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is expected to testify publicly in front of the House Judiciary Committee as soon as this month.",
      "GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee's chairman, told Politico on Friday that he would invite Smith to testify in the coming weeks. A source familiar with the planning confirmed that timeline to CBS News.",
      "Last month, Smith testified in a closed-door deposition for roughly nine hours on Capitol Hill before the committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel in the Biden administration.",
      "The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of President Trump that Smith oversaw. Republicans on the committee have ramped up their criticism of investigative steps Smith and his office took, including their move to obtain phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers.",
      "Smith's two investigations into Mr. Trump resulted in more than 40 federal charges. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "The committee released a transcript and video of Smith's closed-door testimony last month. The former special counsel defended his prosecutions of Mr. Trump and said he was confident that he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also rejected suggestions that he brought the cases against Mr. Trump to harm his 2024 presidential campaign, and said the Biden White House was not involved in his investigations.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said, referring to the 2020 election case. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also revealed that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election interference case, but said he had not yet made a final decision to do so.",
      "Lanny Breuer, one of Smith's attorneys, said in a statement that his client \"has been clear for months he is ready and willing to answer questions in a public hearing about his investigations into President Trump's alleged unlawful efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents.\"",
      "Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, welcomed news of Smith's public testimony.",
      "\"After Republicans forced Jack Smith into a backroom interrogation and rejected our calls for an open public hearing, now they decide they want a public hearing with Jack Smith after all,\" Raskin said in a statement. \"Their backroom strategy backfired in historic fashion.\"",
      "He added: \"This upcoming hearing is a win for truth-seeking Americans and yet another looming humiliation for Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans, who depend on a daily diet of lies to keep their Administration afloat.\"",
      "Smith had offered to testify publicly before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, as prior special counsels have done, but Jordan, the House panel's chairman, issued a subpoena for Smith's initial testimony to be private.",
      "Lawyers for the former special counsel reiterated their request for Smith to answer questions from lawmakers in a public forum following his deposition.",

    "summary": "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro speaks with CBS News in a network exclusive interview about what a U.S. attack on his country could mean.",
    "story": [
      "Speaking for the first time with a U.S. news network following his first-ever conversation with President Trump, Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro said Thursday that he was glad to have been invited for a meeting at the White House, and he hoped an ongoing dialogue with Mr. Trump would \"stop a world war.\"",
      "In the wake of the U.S. attack on Venezuela and capture of the country's former president, Petro said any attack on his country by the U.S. would start a civil war in Colombia, and \"would be dumb policy.\"",
      "Below is a transcript of some of the highlights of CBS News correspondent Lilia Luciano's interview with Petro.",
      "Lilia Luciano: What did you tell President Trump? What did he tell you? Were there any promises made?",
      "President Gustavo Petro: \u200aHe allowed me to explain two points I wanted to make .\u2026",
      "Luciano: What were those points? What did you tell him?",
      "Petro: \u200aOur successes in combating drug trafficking in Colombia go against the narrative that they have created in the United States. I call this political jealousy [over our successes against] Colombian drug trafficking, and they don't\u2026",
      "Luciano: You told them about the success\u2026",
      "Petro: And the United States doesn't know anything about that.",
      "Luciano: You told them about the success of your trafficking seizures of cocaine and drugs in Colombia. What else did you tell him?",
      "Petro: \u200aWell, apart from those results, which have been very good \u2014 historic, I would say in terms of figures \u2014 we talked about Venezuela, at my initiative. He did not mention Venezuela. He did not mention any specifics, but rather we talked about a procedure to restore communication.",
      "Luciano: He did not talk about Venezuela, but there was a discussion about Venezuela. He didn't give you any specifics, but you did talk about Venezuela. What did you talk about? He did not give any specifics about Venezuela. What does that mean, and what was said about Venezuela?",
      "Petro: \u200aThat means that perhaps these points will be dealt with exclusively in person, which seems fine to me.",
      "Luciano: He's waiting to have that conversation?",
      "Petro: \u200aIf there has been no communication throughout his entire term, rebuilding it is undoubtedly not easy and is the first thing that needs to be done. The figures may be disputed, but they should be official, and any falsehoods should be exposed.",
      "Luciano: Tell me more about what President Trump told you.",
      "Petro: He let me talk for 40 of the 55 minutes \u2026 He told me: 'They've told as many lies about you as they have about me.'",
      "Luciano: Were you ever afraid of President Trump coming after you?",
      "Petro: Look, what I'm most afraid of, and I'm not gonna say that I'm not afraid to be threatened when I see the images of helicopters flying in and missiles [in Venezuela], when we don't even have an air defense system \u2026 But that if something happens here against the President of Colombia \u2026 That would without a doubt cause a civil war, and also a hostility toward the United States that the United States does not deserve. It would be dumb policy.\"",
      "Luciano: What is your goal? Why are you going to the White House? Is this about stopping a war in Latin America?",
      "Petro: To stop a world war.",
      "Petro has invited Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez, a member of her ousted predecessor's inner circle, whom the Colombian leader calls a friend, to visit him at his own presidential palace, but says he's not planning to mediate between Rodriguez and Mr. Trump.Luciano: Do you trust President Trump's intentions in Venezuela?",
      "Petro: I think he believes in shared governance, but not separate from the idea of retaining control of the oil.",
      "While Petro says he does not condone the Trump administration's plans to control Venezuelan oil output, he said he does believe he and the U.S. leader share a vision on who should govern Venezuela going forward.Luciano: You're suggesting a shared government between the Delcy regime, alongside the opposition?",
      "Petro: Yes.",
      "Luciano: What do you think about [Venezuelan opposition leader] Mar\u00eda Corina Machado?",
      "Petro: Look, she has said - I have never talked to her.",
      "Luciano: So, you wouldn't trust her or support her as a leader?",
      "Petro: I invited her once, and she didn't want to come. I was obviously surprised that Trump thought the same thing as me.",
      "Mr. Trump said after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that he didn't believe Machado had enough support inside her country to be a viable leader, and despite both he and Petro voicing distrust in her, the Venezuelan people appear to disagree.",
      "Among the opposition, she was polling at 93% ahead of an election last year in which Maduro claimed a decisive victory, but which the U.S. and Machado say he stole. While the Maduro regime blocked Machado from running, the candidate she backed is believed by the U.S. and many outside observers to have won 70% of the vote, despite Maduro declaring himself the winner.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-ballroom-project-east-wing-demolition/",
    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:22:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House ballroom architect said a new second story on the West Wing colonnade would help make the building more uniform with the ballroom.",
    "story": [
      "The White House disclosed Thursday that the White House ballroom project is expected to include plans to add a second story to the West Wing colonnade, a covered walkway that connects the West Wing to the White House residence.",
      "White House officials and the ballroom architect, Shalom Baranes, told members of the National Capital Planning Commission Thursday that adding a second story to the colonnade would help make the building more uniform with the new ballroom being built on the other side of the White House. It would also dramatically alter the iconic space outside the Oval Office.",
      "Baranes told the commission that the heights of the White House and ballroom \"will match exactly.\"",
      "Officials shared details of President Trump's planned ballroom at a public meeting of the planning commission charged with approving it. The White House also said it was not feasible to save the building's East Wing because of structural issues, past decay and other major concerns.",
      "White House officials offered the commission the most comprehensive explanation to date for the dramatic demolition of the East Wing in October to make way for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. The demolition caused a public stir when it began in October with little advance notice, drawing criticism from Democrats and historic preservation groups.",
      "White House says it was more economical to tear down East Wing than to renovate it",
      "Josh Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, ticked off a list of problems in explaining why it was more economical to tear down the East Wing than to renovate it, saying that there were \"significant deficiencies and overall poor structural design and construction.\"",
      "\"The colonnade was structurally unstable. The roof systems had exceeded their service life, and the underpinnings were not sufficient to support the necessary upgrades,\" Fisher told members of the National Capital Planning Commission. \"In the East Wing, there was chronic water intrusion, accelerated deterioration and mold contamination. The electrical infrastructure was obsolete, deemed undersized and non-compliant with current code. Facilities were also non-compliant with both ADA and Secret Service requirements.\"",
      "\"Because of this and other factors, the cost analysis proved that demolition and reconstruction provided the lowest total cost ownership and most effective long-term strategy,\" Fisher continued.",
      "The project will include a new visitors' entry complex, which is intended to speed access to those coming to the White House to use the new ballroom and ensures they won't have to mill around under the tents or other temporary structures that are sometimes erected for large gatherings.",
      "Some of the 12 commission members raised concerns, particularly Commissioner Phil Mendelson, who asked if the planned size and location of the ballroom might change going forward. He was told that \"anything's possible\" but that the existing plans had been studied very thoroughly.",
      "Mendelson, who also serves as chairman of the D.C. Council, then asked if the planned ceiling height of 38 to 40 feet (11.5 to 12 meters) could still be lowered before the final structure is finished and received assurances that the number wasn't fully set.",
      "\"It still seems to me it's overwhelming the existing building,\" Mendelson said.",
      "Upon its completion, the ballroom is expected to be larger than the rest of the existing White House. Will Scharf, a top White House aide who has been tapped by Mr. Trump to head the commission, seemed to listen to the questions and concerns Mendelson raised.",
      "Mendelson also asked why the project hadn't been presented in its entirety to the commission before demolition of the East Wing began. Fisher said some things about the ballroom's construction were of a \"top secret nature.\" Scharf repeated his past assertions that the planning commission doesn't usually have jurisdiction over site work and demolition on any project, including those at the White House.",
      "He pointed to recent work at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which he said was an example of demolition beginning before the commission fully approved plans.",
      "Ballroom has prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, White House acknowleges",
      "Scharf acknowledged that the ballroom project had prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, saying it had sparked \"passionate comments on both sides\" while also noting that public comment wouldn't be part of Thursday's session.",
      "But commissioners were allowed to ask questions and give feedback, with a more formal review expected in the spring that would include public testimony and votes. The commission's next meeting is Feb. 5.",
      "After commissioner questions, Scharf defended the project, arguing that the White House needed a larger and more elegant space to hold visitors. He recalled visiting Windsor Castle last year with Mr. Trump, and noted that the president would eventually be hosting King Charles III of Great Britain.",
      "\"More likely than not, he will be hosted in a tent on the south lawn with porta-potties,\" Scharf said.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Scharf said, \"Our concern is not so much about whether a ballroom is a good idea or not. I obviously believe that it is.\"",
      "\"Our concerns are how will that impact the public viewing experience, the visitor experience,\" he said. \"How will this new building interact with the other existing buildings in the area and more broadly in the city.\"",
      "The White House in December submitted its ballroom plans to the commission, which is one of two federal panels that review construction on federal land \u2014 usually before ground is broken.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the $400 million ballroom, accusing the Trump administration of violating federal laws by proceeding before submitting the project for the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment.",
      "A summary on the commission's website said the purpose of the project is to \"establish a permanent, secure event space within the White House grounds\" that provides increased capacity for official state functions, eliminates reliance on temporary tents and support facilities, and \"protects the historic integrity and cultural landscape of the White House and its grounds.\"",
      "A comprehensive design plan for the White House prepared in 2000 identified the \"need for expanded event space to address growing visitor demand and provide a venue suitable for significant events,\" the summary said. And it said successive administrations had \"recognized this need as an ongoing priority.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years. Last July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot (8,400-square-meter) space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.",
      "But he later increased the ballroom's capacity to 999 people and by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he raised the price tag for the project to $400 million \u2014 twice the original estimate.",
      "The White House has announced few other details about the project but has said it would be completed before Mr. Trump's term ends in January 2029. The president has said the ballroom will be big enough for future presidential inaugurations to be held there and has also said it will have security features, such as bulletproof glass.",
      "While he was in Florida last week, the president bought marble and onyx for the ballroom \"at his own expense,\" the White House said. The cost was not disclosed.",

    "summary": "U.S. prosecutors pursue new criminal probe centering on financial transactions between New York AG Letitia James and her hairdresser, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors have launched a new criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a grand jury previously declined to indict her twice on unrelated criminal charges, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The new probe, which is in its early stages, marks the latest effort by the Justice Department to target one of President Trump's perceived political enemies, after she pursued a civil fraud case against him while he was out of power.",
      "The latest investigation, which was first reported by the New York Times, centers on financial transactions between James and her long-time hairdresser Iyesata Marsh, the sources said.",
      "A grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia indicted James last fall over charges that she had defrauded a financial institution in order to secure a better interest rate on a property she purchased in Norfolk.",
      "The case was dismissed in November, however, after a federal judge ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the U.S. attorney who solely secured the indictment, was unlawfully appointed.",
      "The Justice Department later tried again and twice failed to secure new indictments in the case against her, and late last year, the department appealed the ruling that disqualified Halligan.",
      "James' attorney Abbe Lowell has previously accused the Justice Department of vindictive prosecution, saying she was being unlawfully targeted because of Mr. Trump's animus towards her.",
      "\"Clearly frustrated by the string of failures in carrying out President Trump's political vendetta against Attorney General James, his obedient Justice Department appears to be using its vast resources to try to shake down people based on their association with Ms. James,\" Lowell said in a statement to CBS News. \"Like their earlier attempts, this attack on Ms. James is doomed to fail. The desperation of those working for Trump is palpable and makes indelible the stain already put on this Justice Department. This abuse of justice must end.\"",
      "CBS News could not immediately determine what kinds of potential crimes are being investigated in the latest probe.",
      "Prosecutors are asking questions about money that James has loaned Marsh over the years, one of the sources added.",
      "Last month, Marsh was indicted in the Western District of Louisiana on charges of bank fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with a 2019 purchase of a Land Rover.",
      "Marsh's attorney, Keith Whiddon, declined to comment.",
      "The new investigation is being jointly led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Louisiana and the Northern District of New York, one of the sources said.",
      "John Sarcone, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York, has also separately been overseeing two other probes into James and her office's handling of the civil fraud investigation into Mr. Trump and a lawsuit filed by her office against the National Rifle Association and executives there.",
      "His role in all three of those probes, however, is now in question, after a federal judge earlier on Thursday disqualified him from serving as acting U.S. attorney, saying he was not serving lawfully in his position.",
      "In doing so, the judge found he could not be involved in the handling of the separate probes related to the civil fraud investigation and the NRA.",
      "James sought to challenge his authority to preside over the cases after she was subpoenaed in August. As part of his ruling, the judge also quashed the subpoenas.",

The funding went toward three federal programs, two of which focus on lifting families with children out of poverty.",

      "HHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In an interview with CBS News Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. because they wouldn't show the Trump administration plans for eliminating fraud.",
      "\"The best way to help poor families is to end the fraud,\" he told CBS News. Kennedy said the five states were impacted, not because they're run by Democrats, but because they \"refuse to cooperate with developing plans that would end the fraud.\"",
      "\"We gave them a warning,\" Kennedy said of the five states, claiming that the administration told them they wouldn't cut funding if they presented a plan for handling fraud.",
      "\"But if you won't show us a plan, a workable plan, we're gonna cut it off until you do,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:09:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Minneapolis-based officer was part of an enforcement and removal operations special response team and had a decade of experience.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good during an immigration operation in Minneapolis Wednesday was assigned to an enforcement and removal operations special response team, known as ERO SRT, and he was previously dragged by a car when trying to arrest a man in Bloomington, Minnesota, six months ago.",
      "In the court records from that incident, the officer is identified as Jonathan Ross.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters Wednesday the officer had been dragged by a car in an incident in June. In that incident, which took place on June 17, 2025, federal immigration officers attempted to arrest Roberto Carlos Munoz, a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, on an immigration warrant in St. Paul. As agents tried to conduct a traffic stop and take him into custody, Munoz refused orders to roll down his windows or exit the vehicle.",
      "An ICE ERO officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, Munoz put the vehicle in drive, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car as he accelerated and weaved to try to shake him off.",
      "The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. Eventually, the officer was freed when the vehicle knocked him out of the window and Munoz continued fleeing. The officer suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, and Munoz was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon. The ERO agent involved in this incident was the same agent that opened fire Thursday. He is based in Minneapolis and has over 10 years of experience.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "ICE Special Response Teams provide high-risk operational support for immigration enforcement actions, including executing arrest and search warrants, responding to barricaded subjects, transporting dangerous detainees, and assisting with riot control or disturbances at detention facilities. SRT members receive advanced training in tactical operations, firearms, defensive tactics and crowd control, and they are deployed when situations exceed the capabilities of standard ERO officers.",
      "CBS News has also asked DHS about the officer's disciplinary history.",
      "The shooting occurred at a time when agents have been accused of operating with impunity. When CBS News asked Customs and Border Protection Commander Chief Bovino late last year if any CBP or ICE agents had been disciplined as a result of recent immigration raids, he said that none had been. ICE's head of training, Caleb Vitello, also told us last month in an interview he has not seen any uptick in discipline or investigations.",
      "Under DHS policy, which was last updated in 2023, firearms may not be discharged solely to disable a moving vehicle, and shooting at a moving vehicle is tightly restricted to two narrow circumstances: When a person in the vehicle is using or imminently threatening deadly force by means other than the vehicle, or when the vehicle itself is being operated in a manner that poses an imminent threat, and no other objectively reasonable defensive option exists. This explicitly includes \"moving out of the path of the vehicle,\" the policy says.",
      "As one former senior Homeland Security Investigations agent put it: \"I've been conducting stops and approaches for 25 years \u2026 I never ever wanted to be intentionally in front of the vehicle.\"",
      "There's a tactical expectation that officers avoid self-created jeopardy and, when feasible, they're supposed to try to distance and make angles between themselves and a threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the plaintiffs behind a landmark injunction in Chicago limiting immigration agents' use of force are set to dismiss their lawsuit, even as federal officials signal renewed enforcement surges in major cities.",
      "The case curbed chemical weapons, required body cameras and clear IDs, but now ends without a final ruling. The plaintiffs are dropping their suit not because their concerns have been addressed, but because the 7th Circuit signaled it was likely to overturn it, risking a bad precedent.",
      "In practical terms, this means ICE and Border Patrol are no longer legally bound by the injunction's requirements to limit chemical agents, wear body cameras, or clearly identify themselves. The government does not admit wrongdoing and federal agents can resume the same tactics that were challenged.",
      "The Trump administration's deployment of about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area is part of a crackdown on Minnesota's fraud scandal and immigration.",

      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey indicated Thursday that the city is united in the wake of Wednesday's shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in a residential neighborhood.",
      "\"What I appreciate about this situation right now is we in Minneapolis are all singing with one accord,\" Frey told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"Which is, one, we're gonna stand up for our immigrant community. Two, we're gonna keep people safe. And three, we're not gonna take the bait.\"",
      "Frey said his first priority was \"to keep the people of Minneapolis safe.\"",
      "\"We know that the underlying intention of ICE is not safety, it's not reducing crime, what it is, is to cause chaos and disruption in our city,\" Frey said. \"Clearly they want to deploy additional military resources, and we're not gonna take the bait.\"",
      "According to Frey, the protests that have taken place since the killing of Renee Good do not mirror the violence that engulfed Minneapolis and other U.S. cities following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.",
      "\"If you've watched how a lot of these protests have carried out, this is not some repeat of what we saw in 2020,\" Frey said. \"What we see is people saying, 'Hey, hang on one second, ICE wants us to take the bait, they want us to screw up, do something wrong, and ultimately see even greater military presence in our city.'\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, White House border czar Tom Homan said that he wanted ICE agents to be given access to local jails and prisons in order to apprehend undocumented immigrants, arguing that this would make the current situation safer.",
      "When pressed on whether he would consider opening up local jails, Frey said that \"the cities don't run the jail, the jails are under the purview of the sheriff,\" adding that mistrust exists between federal authorities and local residents and municipalities.",
      "This comes after Frey, in a news conference Wednesday, demanded that ICE \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\" The Trump administration\u00a0has surged\u00a0about 2,000 federal immigration agents to the Twin Cities area as part of both an immigration crackdown and in response to the\u00a0state's fraud scandal.",
      "\"There's not a lot of confidence in this federal administration that they are going to do the right thing, either by our immigrant community, or perhaps more importantly, under the Constitution of the United States,\" Frey said.",
      "The mayor said that the Obama administration built trust with \"mayors, chiefs and sheriffs around the country,\" something this White House has failed to do, he argued. Frey also took aim at claims from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who on Wednesday described Good's actions leading up to the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "The White House has alleged that the shooting by the ICE officer was an act of self-defense, while witnesses and local officials, including Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have disputed that claim, citing videos of the encounter that appear to show otherwise.",
      "\"There was that kind of trust built in,\" Frey said of past administrations. \"Why? Because they didn't create these B.S. narratives that we're seeing already, exactly like this one, where something horrific takes place, they, from the get-go, say this is domestic terrorism. Domestic terrorism? Give me a break, this woman was trying to leave.\"",

      "According to McLaughlin, the woman \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\"",
      "An ICE officer, \"fearing for his life,\" then \"fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and \"were attempting to push out their vehicle\" when \"a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman \"viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.",
      "Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims",
      "Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.",
      "In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account \"bull****.\"",
      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.",
      "\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz said. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"",
      "One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.",
      "In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",
      "That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.",
      "The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.",
      "Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.",
      "ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit",
      "A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team \u2014 a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.",
      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.",
      "According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Will the officer face charges or discipline?",
      "It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly\u00a0cutting state investigators out of the process.",
      "\"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,\" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.",
      "\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are \"verifiably false.\"",
      "The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" the agency said.",
      "Noem, however, said Thursday, \"They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she added.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

    "summary": "The House approved a three-year extension of expired health care tax credits, with increased Republican support.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House approved on Thursday a three-year extension of health care tax credits that expired at the end of last year, with a group of Republicans joining Democrats to propel the measure to passage in the lower chamber.",
      "In a 230 to 196 vote, 17 Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. The legislation is unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form, but some lawmakers are hopeful it will serve as the starting point for a broader compromise.",
      "\"Today, let's celebrate a victory of getting something done,\" Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York told reporters Thursday. \"And then, we'll start working on the policy issue next week related to what's the common ground in the Senate that we can get to the next step.\"",
      "The outcome came after four Republicans crossed the aisle last month, revolting against their leadership to join Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. The Affordable Care Act tax credits subsidized premiums for millions of Americans who have coverage in state-run exchanges. One analysis found that premiums were set to double without the enhanced credits.",
      "The tax credits' extension was at the center of the government shutdown, which stretched through October and into November to become the longest in history. After a handful of Senate Democrats broke with their party to end the shutdown without securing an extension for the enhanced tax credits, House Democrats pushed ahead on an effort of their own \u2014 but needed GOP support to make it successful.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, led the effort to force the vote with a discharge petition in the final weeks of the year. Moderate Republicans have generally criticized a straight extension of the tax credits without reforms. But a handful of GOP members signed onto the petition, arguing that an extension of the tax credits without reforms was preferable to letting them expire.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York was one of the four Republicans who signed onto the petition last month, along with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"We endeavored in a bipartisan negotiation after the shutdown to come up with a compromise bill that would extend the subsidies, but put in place necessary reforms,\" Lawler told reporters Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, we couldn't get a vote on that before Christmas, and so the only alternative was to sign the three-year discharge.\"",
      "The moderate Republicans are banking on the measure being a vehicle for a compromise bill in the Senate.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that when we pass the discharge through the House, the Senate will be able to use that vehicle and garner enough support to get a bipartisan compromise across the finish line,\" Lawler said.",
      "The search for a Senate compromise",
      "A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs. And the discharge petition added momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise before lawmakers broke for recess in December. Now, lawmakers are looking to the Senate to move ahead with a long-sought agreement to extend the credits, with some reforms.",
      "The Senate rejected a Democrat-led effort to pass a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits last month. Republicans offered an alternative plan to send funds directly to consumers through health savings accounts that also fell short. But a number of Senate Republicans expressed willingness to reach a compromise.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who's been involved in the discussions, told reporters on Tuesday that \"we're continuing to work hard\" on a compromise measure. She said parts of the measure would be similar to what she and Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, originally proposed last month. That plan would extend the tax credits for two years, with some reforms in the first year and then \"more substantial reforms\" in the second.",
      "Moreno outlined the emerging deal Thursday, telling reporters that it would include a two-year extension of the enhanced tax credits and an extension of the open enrollment period until March 1. It would also impose a new income eligibility cap for the subsidies at 700% of the federal poverty level; a $5 per month or $60 per year minimum premium; and a $100,000 fine of insurance companies \"for deliberately causing fraud\" by signing someone up without their consent. In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account.",
      "Leaving a bicameral meeting of the so-called \"problem solvers\" on Thursday, multiple lawmakers said they expected language from the compromise bill to be released next week.",
      "Asked after Thursday's vote whether he would back such a deal, Jeffries told reporters that House Democrats are \"focused on a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits at the moment.\"",
      "\"But we've always said that we will consider in good faith anything that emerges from the Senate in a bipartisan way, if it decisively deals with the Republican health care crisis, including by providing a meaningful extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, asked about the timeline for addressing the tax credits in the upper chamber, told reporters Wednesday that the conversations among the bipartisan group of lawmakers have been productive and \"we'll see where the discussions are going.\"",
      "\"There's some thorny issues they have to resolve,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"You got to deal with reforms, you got to deal with a bridge to an HSA, and then obviously, Hyde is a big, big challenge.\"",
      "President Trump encouraged Republicans in Congress to be \"flexible\" on the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions, in order to find a solution on health care costs. But conservatives in Congress haven't expressed willingness to move on the issue, seeking additional Hyde amendment language within the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges.",
      "\"There's no flexibility. You're either using public funds to pay for abortion or you're not. We're not sure there's a compromise available on that,\" Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Thune said while Collins and Moreno are trying to address the challenging issues, there isn't \"a landing spot just yet.\"",
      "\"The conversations are constructive,\" he added. \"But at this point, there's nothing that I'm aware of that we'll be voting on soon.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday failed to override two of President Trump's vetoes of bipartisan bills, with Republicans largely sticking by the president to uphold his decision to block the legislation.",
      "Both bills initially passed the House and Senate unanimously. Thursday's votes required a two-thirds majority to override the vetoes, but both fell significantly short.",
      "One of the pieces of legislation would have given the Miccosukee Tribe more control over a portion of the Florida Everglades, and the second would have funded a water pipeline in southeast Colorado. The president vetoed both in December.",
      "The vote to override Mr. Trump's veto of the Florida bill was 236 in favor to 188 opposed. The vote on the veto of the Colorado bill was 248 to 177.",
      "In a message to Congress, Mr. Trump explained the vetoes were aimed at \"ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts.\" But some lawmakers viewed the blocking of the bills as retaliation over political disagreements.",
      "The president tied his decision on the Florida bill in part to the tribe's opposition to his immigration policies.

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

      "The scheduled return could change depending on weather conditions, NASA said.",
      "\"Mission managers continue monitoring conditions in the recovery area, as undocking of the SpaceX Dragon depends on spacecraft readiness, recovery team readiness, weather, sea states, and other factors,\" NASA said in a statement Friday. \"NASA and SpaceX will select a specific splashdown time and location closer to the Crew-11 spacecraft undocking.\"",

      "Four space station fliers have been told to cut their mission short and return to Earth ahead of schedule because of an apparently serious medical issue affecting an unidentified crew member, NASA announced Thursday.",
      "\"Yesterday, January 7, a single crew member on board the station experienced a medical situation and is now stable,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a news conference.",
      "\"After discussions with Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. J.D. Polk and leadership across the agency, I've come to the decision that it's in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew 11 ahead of their planned departure (in mid February). ... We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",
      "Cloud-9 may continue to change and could even grow into a galaxy if it continues to expand, NASA said.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
      "The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region.",
      "The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to secure power from its nuclear plant in Clinton, Illinois.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",

      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:13:13 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",

      "Two people were shot by federal agents in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday, Portland police said. The Department of Homeland Security said the shooting involved Customs and Border Patrol agents.",
      "Two people, a man and a woman, were wounded and hospitalized, Portland Police Chief Bob Day said in a news conference Thursday night.",
      "Homeland Security identified the two people Friday as Luis David Nino-Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras from Venezuela and accused them of being suspected associates with the Tren de Aragua gang. Nino-Moncada sustained an injury to the arm, DHS said, while Zambrano-Contreras was hit in the chest. Both are in stable condition, and Nino-Moncada is now in FBI custody, the agency said.",
      "The department said on social media that Nino-Moncada   entered the country illegally in 2022 and that a removal order had been issued for him. The department said Zambrano-Contreras entered the U.S. illegally in 2023.",
      "The people shot were a husband and wife, according to a statement from the PCUN farmworkers union, which is active in supporting immigrants and Latinos in the community. However, the DHS claimed the two are not married.",
      "DHS said Border Patrol agents stopped a car searching for a Venezuelan they claim is in the country illegally and a member of Tren de Aragua. Day said in a news conference Friday that the two \"do have some nexus to involvement\" with Tren de Aragua, a gang that the Trump administration has designated\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "DHS said after the agents identified themselves, the driver \"weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents.\"",
      "\"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,\" DHS said. The department said the man drove off with his passenger.",
      "The shooting occurred at around 2:18 p.m. local time in the Hazelwood neighborhood in East Portland. Portland police officers responded to a 911 call and \"confirmed federal agents were involved in a shooting,\" Day said.",
      "About six minutes later, Day said, officers responded to a separate location about three miles away for a 911 call, where they found a man and woman with gunshot wounds.",
      "\"Officers determined that the two people who were injured in the shooting involving the federal agents in the earlier call,\" Day said. The two victims were then rushed to separate hospitals.",
      "\"There were federal officers both at the original scene, and federal officers met us out at the scene farther away,\" Day said.",
      "Day added that \"it's early on, we do not know the cause.\"",
      "The police chief told reporters the FBI was investigating the shooting.",
      "\"This is a federal investigation being led by the FBI,\" Day said, noting that Portland police were providing \"investigative support and perimeter support\" that was \"minimal.\"",
      "Later, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced on social media that his office is opening a formal investigation into the shooting. \"Our office will take every step necessary to ensure the rights and security of Oregonians are protected,\" he said, adding that the investigation \"will look into whether any federal officer acted outside the scope of their lawful authority and will include witness interviews, video evidence, and other relevant materials.\"",
      "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said during the news conference, \"We are all shaken and outraged by another terrible, unnecessary violent event instigated by a reckless agenda of the Trump administration.\" She said her message to the federal government was that \"we demand transparency, we demand cooperation with Portland police and the Multnomah County DA.\"",
      "Kotek said she had not spoken to any White House officials about the incident.",
      "Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the ICE facility in downtown Portland as night fell. The city's police used a sound truck to warn protesters to stay off roadways and obey the law or face possible arrest and the possible use of \"impact munitions or other physical force.\" Later, they said six people were arrested for alleged misdemeanors.",
      "As of midnight Thursday, some 60-90 protesters were still there, but most were just standing around and roads were clear, CBS News' Amanda Arden reported.",
      "The shooting came a day after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. DHS officials also alleged in that incident that Good had \"weaponized her vehicle,\" although Minnesota officials and video from the scene have cast doubt on that assertion.",
      "\"Our community deserves answers, our community deserves accountability, and most of all, our community deserves peace,\" Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said during the briefing.",
      "\"We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,\" Wilson said in an earlier statement. \"Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences. As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.\"",
      "A Portland City Council session\u00a0abruptly recessed\u00a0on Thursday after members were informed of the shooting.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said on social media, \"Trump's deployment of federal agents in my hometown is clearly inflaming violence \u2014 and must end.\" Fellow Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote on Facebook, \"Please keep protests of Trump's ICE/CBP peaceful, as Trump wants to generate riots. Don't take the bait.\"",
      "Portland has been the site of continued protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown for months. This fall, hundreds of National Guard troops were sent to Portland to \"protect federal assets and personnel\" carrying out immigration operations, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week\u00a0that he was pulling National Guard troops out of Portland as well as Chicago and Los Angeles, after a federal court ruled against the administration's action. But he said, \"we will come back\" if crime \"begins to soar again.\"",

    "story": [
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie told CBS News Friday that he was able to convince President Trump in a phone call several months ago not to deploy federal agents to San Francisco.",
      "In a live interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil, Lurie, a moderate Democrat, said that the president called him while he was sitting in a car.",
      "\"I took the call, and his first question to me was, 'How's it going there?'\" Lurie recounted.",
      "In October, sources told CBS News that the president was planning to surge Border Patrol agents to San Francisco as part of the White House's ongoing immigration crackdown that has seen it deploy federal immigration officers to cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and most recently, Minneapolis.",
      "At the time, the reports prompted pushback from California officials, including Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "However, shortly after that report, Mr. Trump announced that he had called off the plan to \"surge\" federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Lurie.",
      "\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 23. The president also noted that \"friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge.\"",
      "\"I told him what I would tell you,\" Lurie said Friday of his October call with Mr. Trump. \"San Francisco is a city on the rise, crime is at historic lows, all economic indicators are on the right direction, and our local law enforcement is doing an incredible job.\"",
      "Going back to the pandemic, San Francisco has often been the strong focus of criticism from Republican lawmakers over its struggles in combatting crime and homelessness. It was voter frustration over those issues that helped Lurie defeat incumbent London Breed in November 2024.",
      "Lurie, however, acknowledged that the city still has \"a lot of work to do.\"",
      "\"I'm clear-eyed about our challenges still,\" Lurie said. \"In the daytime, we have really ended our drug markets. At night, we still struggle on some of the those blocks that you see.\"",
      "An heir to the Levi Strauss & Co. fortune, Lurie also declined Friday to say whether he supports a proposed California ballot initiative that would institute a one-time 5% tax on the state's billionaires.",
      "\"I stay laser-focused on what I can control, and that's what's happening here in San Francisco,\" Lurie said. \"I don't get involved on what may or may not happen up in Sacramento, or frankly, for that matter, D.C.\"",

Minnesota is going to be the genesis for a national rollout,\" Bessent said. \"Treasury will deploy all tools to bring an end to this egregious, unchecked fraud and hold perpetrators to account.\"",
      "According to Bessent, the IRS task force will specifically probe financial institutions that facilitate wire transfers, as evidence from the Feeding Our Future trial showed some suspects sent money to banks in Kenya and China. Bessent added that four Twin Cities-based businesses are under investigation, but did not share their names. The department is also requiring all financial institutions in Hennepin and Ramsey counties to report any overseas transfer of $3,000 or more.",
      "\"Think of the absurdity of money being wired from Minnesota by these individuals that could have come from government programs or from excess benefits,\" Bessent added. \"This should not be wired out of the country and we are going to be cracking down on that.\"",
      "Bessent's visit also comes on the heels of Attorney General Pam Bondi's announcement that a team of prosecutors is headed to Minnesota \"to reinforce our U.S. Attorney's Office and put perpetrators of this widespread fraud behind bars.\"",
      "\"We will deliver severe consequences in Minnesota and stand ready to deploy to any other state where similar fraud schemes are robbing American taxpayers,\" Bondi said.",

      "A rare copy of the comic book that introduced the world to Superman \u2014 and was also once stolen from the home of actor Nicolas Cage \u2014 has been sold for a record $15 million.",
      "The private deal for \"Action Comics No. 1\" was announced Friday. It eclipses the previous record price for a comic book, set last November when a copy of \"Superman No. 1\u2033 was sold at auction for $9.12 million.",
      "The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.",
      "The comic \u2014 which sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938 \u2014 was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. But over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to \"turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.\"",
      "Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, according to Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect President Vincent Zurzolo.",
      "\"This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,\" Zurzolo said. \"Its importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.\"",
      "The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of an old storage locker in Southern California. It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",

      "\"During that 11-year period (it was missing), it skyrocketed in value,\" Fishler said. \"The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.\"",
      "Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911.",
      "\"It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,\" Fishler noted. \"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon \u2014 and that's what Action No. 1 is \u2014 an icon of American pop culture.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:41:52 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The number of uninsured will rise by an average of 3.8 million each year from 2026 to 2034 without an extension of the credits, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2024.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an\u00a0extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The death of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday, has sparked national outcry.",
      "Her father, Timothy Granger, tells \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil that she was the kind of person who always cared deeply about other people. He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, and had three children of her own \u2014 two from her first marriage and a 6-year-old from her second. Her father said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her husband.",
      "Good, who was a U.S. citizen, was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and was not a target for arrest by ICE agents, city leaders said.",
      "The Associated Press\u00a0reports she had just dropped her 6-year-old off at school and was driving home with her wife when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "Good's father said the orphaned child has a loving extended family and will be \"well taken care of.\"",
      "Here's more about what we know so far about Good and the fatal shooting.",
      "A \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who recently moved to Minneapolis",
      "Renee Good described herself in the bio of her Instagram profile as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who was currently \"experiencing Minneapolis.\"",
      "Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning. Ganger told the newspaper that her daughter wasn't part of a protest and said her daughter \"was probably terrified.\"",
      "\"Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,\" Ganger told the Tribune. \"She was extremely compassionate. She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"",
      "After working briefly in banking in Colorado, her father said she moved east got a degree from Old Dominion University in Virginia, becoming a poet and English teacher. She was working as a substitute teacher in Minneapolis, he said.",
      "Her first husband told the AP that Good had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union before spending some time as a stay-at-home mother in recent years.",
      "Good was widowed when her husband Timmy Ray Macklin Jr. died in 2023 at age 36, the Tribune reported. He was the father of her 6-year-old son; AP reported that Good's two older children are a 12-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter.",
      "In a statement released to Minnesota Public Radio, her wife, Becca Good, who was in the car during the shooting, thanked people from all over the country who reached out to show their support.",
      "\"if you ever encountered my wife, Renee Nicole Macklin Good, you know that above all else, she was kind. In fact, kindness radiated out of her,\" she wrote.",
      "\"Renee lived by an overarching belief: there is kindness in the world and we need to do everything we can to find it where it resides and nurture it where it needs to grow. Renee was a Christian who knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.\"",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion in December 2020 and received a poetry prize from the university, its English department announced in a Facebook\u00a0post\u00a0that year. The post said Good studied creative writing and hosted a podcast.",
      "\"It is with great sadness that Old Dominion University mourns the loss of one of our own, Renee (Macklin) Good,\" said Brian Hemphill, the university's president, in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0Hemphill described her death as a \"tragic killing\" and \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.\"",
      "AP also reports it appears she was never charged with anything involving law enforcement beyond a traffic ticket.",
      "\"Devastated for that whole family\"",
      "Joan Rose, who was Good's former neighbor in Kansas City, Missouri, told CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0that Good's family had lived across the street from her until December 2024. Rose said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\" Good had lived in the Waldo neighborhood with her partner, young son and dogs, and Rose said the two older children routinely visited them.",
      "Rose said she thought Good's family had planned to move to Canada when they left Missouri last year.",
      "\"I heard they were moving to Canada because of the politics here,\" she told KCTV. \"I had thought about them sometimes, you know, passing by their house thinking, 'Oh, I hope they're OK in Canada, you know, I hope that they're living, you know, a good life and that they're, they're worry free.' And this is just the opposite of that. So, I'm just devastated for that whole family.\"",
      "A GoFundMe campaign established in the wake of the shooting is asking the public to \"support the wife and son of Renee Good as they grapple with the devastating loss of their wife and mother.\"",
      "\"Renee was pure sunshine, pure, love,\" reads the fundraiser's description. \"She will be desperately missed.\"",
      "The campaign has raised nearly $500,000 as of Thursday morning.",
      "A community vigil held for Good in Minneapolis Wednesday night drew a large crowd of attendees, many of whom shared emotional and frustrated remarks about the latest ICE operations that have recently ramped up across the region,\u00a0CBS Minnesota\u00a0reported. Protests also took place in other cities around the U.S.",
      "The agent involved in the shooting was part of a surge of roughly 2,000 federal agents and officers\u00a0the Trump administration recently deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in a response to both immigration and Minnesota's\u00a0fraud scandal.",
      "Shooting captured on video",
      "Police responded to a call reporting the shooting, which happened in a neighborhood in south Minneapolis, at about 9:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, according to the city. When officers arrived, they found that a woman, later identified as Good, had been shot in the head. She was rushed by firefighters to a Minneapolis hospital, where she later died, the city said.",
      "Federal officials, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, characterized the shooting as an act of self-defense on the part of the ICE agent who fired the weapon when the driver \"attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\" However, numerous witnesses and local leaders are questioning that account.",
      "Multiple videos have circulated online of the incident, which show the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV on a residential street when an ICE agent approached and addressed her through the window of her vehicle. Several other agents stood nearby.",
      "In one of the videos, an officer can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" before reaching for the Honda's door handle. At that point, the Honda is seen backing up as another agent steps in front of the car. The Honda then begins to drive away, and the agent in front of it fires his weapon into the car. Whether the agent was hit by the car, as federal officials have said, is not clear based on the videos. They show the agent move to the side of the SUV as he fires several more shots, and the car moves forward down the street before crashing into another car.",
      "The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was originally assigned to investigate Good's death jointly with FBI, but the state agency has since withdrawn from the case and alleged federal authorities restricted its access to evidence, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "The BCA said the U.S. Attorney's Office \"reversed course\" and informed the agency that \"the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI.\"",

    "summary": "Veteran diplomat tells CBS News Denmark \"ready to cooperate\" on Greenland, and he expects U.S. to abandon \"anachronistic approach of colonialism\" post-Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Denmark's former ambassador to NATO, veteran diplomat Michael Zilmer-Johns, had tough words for the Trump administration as Danish and American officials prepare to discuss the future of the small European nation's semi-autonomous territory of Greenland.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he'll meet Danish officials next week, but he has not specified where or when. While Zlimer-Johns was critical of the Trump administration's stated intention to make the world's largest, strategically located island part of the U.S., he spoke pragmatically and hopefully about the future of the U.S.-Denmark relationship, and the future of the transatlantic NATO alliance that the U.S. has led for decades.",
      "Below are the highlights of CBS News' interview with the Danish diplomat.",
      "CBS News: About all this talk from the White House about taking Greenland, how do you feel?",
      "Michael Zilmer-Johns: Well, I was shocked, like I think almost every Dane and every Greenlander,, because the U.S. has, in our view, everything it needs for its security in Greenland. There's a huge base there. It has the potential to build up. We have a defense agreement specifically about Greenland, with the US dating back to the year 1951.",
      "I'm angry because I think that this is an affront to an ally that has stood up with the U.S. in Afghanistan, in Iraq, all over the world. Wherever they asked us to participate, we did. So I think it's totally ungrateful.",
      "CBS News: The Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, warned if Trump attacked Denmark to take Greenland, it would be the end of NATO. In her words, \"everything stops, including NATO, and thus the security that has been established since the end of the Second World War.\" As Denmark's former top representative to NATO, to what extent do you fear the end of NATO?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I'm worried, but I am still confident that at the end of the day, better counsels will prevail, that we will find some kind of agreement with the Trump administration on Greenland so that NATO can continue as it should. It will be a very different NATO, anyhow, because it's clear that the Americans are withdrawing from Europe and Europe is going to step up. So it will be more European NATO in the future. But hopefully we can keep it together.\"",
      "CBS News: There has been criticism that a potential U.S. use of military force would basically be a NATO member against another NATO member in the nearly 80 years of the existence of this alliance. In your opinion, would the use of U.S. military force trigger Article 5, (my addition: the mutual defense clause that states an attack on one member is an attack on all 32 NATO nations)?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I mean it's of course absurd to have such a situation where two NATO countries would be in a military conflict. If it was an outside power that did this to Denmark, then of course that would trigger Article 5. In a situation where it's the strongest member of NATO that would attack small Denmark, I think that this would be something where NATO could not engage because it's a conflict inside NATO and not between NATO and the foreign power.",
      "I still find it very difficult to imagine that we would see actual fighting between Danish soldiers and Americans. But of course, the Danish soldiers in Greenland have a standing order to defend the territory against any aggression.",
      "But should it happen, then at the end of the day, I think that the Danish government would tell the Danish troops to stand down because, of course, a military conflict between the world's greatest military power and small Denmark, that is an inevitable result.",
      "CBS News: Would an independent Greenland be able to defend itself against security issues, strategic adversaries? Here, China, Russia, as the White House, as President Trump has said?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: Greenland has a population of 60,000 people. It's a huge land mass, the size of most of Western Europe, so of course it could not do that alone. It would need a stronger partner. It could be Denmark, it could be the US, but the Greenlanders themselves have said that if they - and when they should - become independent, they will continue to be a member of NATO.",
      "CBS News: Right after World War II, the United States offered roughly $100 million in gold to buy Greenland from Denmark at that time. Right now, with inflation, that goes up to about $12-13 billion. What do you feel about that number as applied to Greenland in terms of its value?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think the whole principle of selling Greenland is out of the question. That's the thing that could happen in a different age where there were a lot of colonial powers and Greenland was a colony at that time and there were British colonies all over Africa. And we had sold the West Indies Islands to the Americans in 1916. So at that stage, it was not something that would be inconceivable. But today, with the status that Greenland has, it is simply not on the table. So whatever the amount would be, it would never be realistic, or something that anybody in Greenland could imagine.",
      "CBS News: Is the White House being imperial in its ambitions?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think that you could put it that way. When you look at the new security strategy, when you look what President Trump is saying about the Western Hemisphere and the need for control and the needs to expand the U.S., that sounds very much like imperialism in my eye.",
      "Traditionally, America was at the forefront of decolonization and making the Europeans give up their colonies, forcing them to do so or putting pressure to do. I do not think that this approach will continue after President Trump. Even if his MAGA movement or the Republicans should continue to control the White House. I think it's very much Trump's personal approach, this anachronistic approach of colonialism, more imperialism.",
      "CBS News: Is there anything else you would like to add in any talking points? A message for President Trump, a message for Americans?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I would like to say that we are ready to cooperate with America in all aspects of ensuring the legitimate security interests in and around Greenland. And we would invite you to do so. Thank you very much.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is expected to testify publicly in front of the House Judiciary Committee as soon as this month.",
      "GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee's chairman, told Politico on Friday that he would invite Smith to testify in the coming weeks. A source familiar with the planning confirmed that timeline to CBS News.",
      "Last month, Smith testified in a closed-door deposition for roughly nine hours on Capitol Hill before the committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel in the Biden administration.",
      "The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of President Trump that Smith oversaw. Republicans on the committee have ramped up their criticism of investigative steps Smith and his office took, including their move to obtain phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers.",
      "Smith's two investigations into Mr. Trump resulted in more than 40 federal charges. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "The committee released a transcript and video of Smith's closed-door testimony last month. The former special counsel defended his prosecutions of Mr. Trump and said he was confident that he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also rejected suggestions that he brought the cases against Mr. Trump to harm his 2024 presidential campaign, and said the Biden White House was not involved in his investigations.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said, referring to the 2020 election case. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also revealed that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election interference case, but said he had not yet made a final decision to do so.",
      "Lanny Breuer, one of Smith's attorneys, said in a statement that his client \"has been clear for months he is ready and willing to answer questions in a public hearing about his investigations into President Trump's alleged unlawful efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents.\"",
      "Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, welcomed news of Smith's public testimony.",
      "\"After Republicans forced Jack Smith into a backroom interrogation and rejected our calls for an open public hearing, now they decide they want a public hearing with Jack Smith after all,\" Raskin said in a statement. \"Their backroom strategy backfired in historic fashion.\"",
      "He added: \"This upcoming hearing is a win for truth-seeking Americans and yet another looming humiliation for Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans, who depend on a daily diet of lies to keep their Administration afloat.\"",
      "Smith had offered to testify publicly before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, as prior special counsels have done, but Jordan, the House panel's chairman, issued a subpoena for Smith's initial testimony to be private.",
      "Lawyers for the former special counsel reiterated their request for Smith to answer questions from lawmakers in a public forum following his deposition.",

    "summary": "The monthly job gains were slightly below the 55,000 forecast by economists, according to a poll by FactSet.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 50,000 jobs in December, capping a year of muted job growth that saw employers pull back on hiring amid economic uncertainty.",
      "The numbers",
      "The monthly job gains were below the 55,000 forecast by economists, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.",
      "Payroll gains were revised downward for both October and November, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously reported in those months. The U.S. labor market lost 173,000 jobs in October, a larger decline than the earlier reported decline of 105,000 jobs, while November hiring was revised down to 56,000 from 64,000.",
      "\"The labor market has shown continued resiliency, but it's still softening, and the pace of year-to-date overall employment gains has slowed to the dragging pace of growth we saw in 2020,\" said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management, in a Friday email.",
      "In December, hiring was robust in food services and drinking, health care and social assistance, while the retail sector shed jobs, the BLS said.",
      "Most layoffs since 2020",
      "Employers announced 1.2 million job cuts in 2025, a 58% increase from the prior year and the highest level since 2020, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said Thursday.",
      "Job growth slowed throughout 2025 as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring. Employers added a total of roughly 584,000 jobs in 2025, down sharply from more than 2 million the previous year and the weakest annual gain outside a recession since 2003, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Some big corporations, such as Amazon, cut jobs as they sought to rely more on artificial intelligence, while the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency oversaw the reduction of roughly 300,000 government jobs last year, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The headwinds facing the labor market prompted the Federal Reserve to thrice cut its benchmark interest rate late last year, as lowering borrowing costs can help spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to expand.",
      "Prior to the release of Friday's report, EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said he is forecasting hiring will average 25,000 new jobs per month for the first half of 2026, while the unemployment rate could drift up to 4.8%.",
      "What it means",
      "While hiring was weak in 2025, experts don't think the labor market is collapsing.",
      "\"There aren't any red flashing lights indicating an imminent recession, but there are plenty of yellow warning lights flashing, and there is the risk that we could approach stall speed,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a Friday research note.",
      "Payroll gains averaged about 50,000 per month last year, according to BLS\u00a0data, which is the amount the economy requires to maintain a stable labor market, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, which aligns with the December job gains and the average payroll gains throughout 2025.",
      "Interest rate outlook",
      "Signs of stabilization in the labor market \u2014 particularly a lower jobless rate \u2014 could lead the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes on interest rate cuts for now, according to some experts.",
      "\"For this report, all roads lead to the unemployment rate,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, in an email. \"At 4.4%, it simply reads as relief versus 4.6% and it should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining strong hiring while also taming inflation. A weaker labor market picture in 2025 compelled the central bank to cut interest rates three times.",
      "The upshot for 2026, experts say, is that rate cuts are coming, but they may arrive later in the year.",
      "Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an email note that she expects a pause for now, but two cuts at some point this year.",

      "The White House disclosed Thursday that the White House ballroom project is expected to include plans to add a second story to the West Wing colonnade, a covered walkway that connects the West Wing to the White House residence.",
      "White House officials and the ballroom architect, Shalom Baranes, told members of the National Capital Planning Commission Thursday that adding a second story to the colonnade would help make the building more uniform with the new ballroom being built on the other side of the White House. It would also dramatically alter the iconic space outside the Oval Office.",

The demolition caused a public stir when it began in October with little advance notice, drawing criticism from Democrats and historic preservation groups.",
      "White House says it was more economical to tear down East Wing than to renovate it",
      "Josh Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, ticked off a list of problems in explaining why it was more economical to tear down the East Wing than to renovate it, saying that there were \"significant deficiencies and overall poor structural design and construction.\"",
      "\"The colonnade was structurally unstable. The roof systems had exceeded their service life, and the underpinnings were not sufficient to support the necessary upgrades,\" Fisher told members of the National Capital Planning Commission. \"In the East Wing, there was chronic water intrusion, accelerated deterioration and mold contamination. The electrical infrastructure was obsolete, deemed undersized and non-compliant with current code. Facilities were also non-compliant with both ADA and Secret Service requirements.\"",
      "\"Because of this and other factors, the cost analysis proved that demolition and reconstruction provided the lowest total cost ownership and most effective long-term strategy,\" Fisher continued.",
      "The project will include a new visitors' entry complex, which is intended to speed access to those coming to the White House to use the new ballroom and ensures they won't have to mill around under the tents or other temporary structures that are sometimes erected for large gatherings.",
      "Some of the 12 commission members raised concerns, particularly Commissioner Phil Mendelson, who asked if the planned size and location of the ballroom might change going forward. He was told that \"anything's possible\" but that the existing plans had been studied very thoroughly.",
      "Mendelson, who also serves as chairman of the D.C. Council, then asked if the planned ceiling height of 38 to 40 feet (11.5 to 12 meters) could still be lowered before the final structure is finished and received assurances that the number wasn't fully set.",
      "\"It still seems to me it's overwhelming the existing building,\" Mendelson said.",
      "Upon its completion, the ballroom is expected to be larger than the rest of the existing White House. Will Scharf, a top White House aide who has been tapped by Mr. Trump to head the commission, seemed to listen to the questions and concerns Mendelson raised.",
      "Mendelson also asked why the project hadn't been presented in its entirety to the commission before demolition of the East Wing began. Fisher said some things about the ballroom's construction were of a \"top secret nature.\" Scharf repeated his past assertions that the planning commission doesn't usually have jurisdiction over site work and demolition on any project, including those at the White House.",
      "He pointed to recent work at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which he said was an example of demolition beginning before the commission fully approved plans.",
      "Ballroom has prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, White House acknowleges",
      "Scharf acknowledged that the ballroom project had prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, saying it had sparked \"passionate comments on both sides\" while also noting that public comment wouldn't be part of Thursday's session.",
      "But commissioners were allowed to ask questions and give feedback, with a more formal review expected in the spring that would include public testimony and votes. The commission's next meeting is Feb. 5.",
      "After commissioner questions, Scharf defended the project, arguing that the White House needed a larger and more elegant space to hold visitors. He recalled visiting Windsor Castle last year with Mr. Trump, and noted that the president would eventually be hosting King Charles III of Great Britain.",
      "\"More likely than not, he will be hosted in a tent on the south lawn with porta-potties,\" Scharf said.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Scharf said, \"Our concern is not so much about whether a ballroom is a good idea or not. I obviously believe that it is.\"",
      "\"Our concerns are how will that impact the public viewing experience, the visitor experience,\" he said. \"How will this new building interact with the other existing buildings in the area and more broadly in the city.\"",
      "The White House in December submitted its ballroom plans to the commission, which is one of two federal panels that review construction on federal land \u2014 usually before ground is broken.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the $400 million ballroom, accusing the Trump administration of violating federal laws by proceeding before submitting the project for the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment.",
      "A summary on the commission's website said the purpose of the project is to \"establish a permanent, secure event space within the White House grounds\" that provides increased capacity for official state functions, eliminates reliance on temporary tents and support facilities, and \"protects the historic integrity and cultural landscape of the White House and its grounds.\"",
      "A comprehensive design plan for the White House prepared in 2000 identified the \"need for expanded event space to address growing visitor demand and provide a venue suitable for significant events,\" the summary said. And it said successive administrations had \"recognized this need as an ongoing priority.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years. Last July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot (8,400-square-meter) space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.",
      "But he later increased the ballroom's capacity to 999 people and by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he raised the price tag for the project to $400 million \u2014 twice the original estimate.",
      "The White House has announced few other details about the project but has said it would be completed before Mr. Trump's term ends in January 2029. The president has said the ballroom will be big enough for future presidential inaugurations to be held there and has also said it will have security features, such as bulletproof glass.",
      "While he was in Florida last week, the president bought marble and onyx for the ballroom \"at his own expense,\" the White House said. The cost was not disclosed.",

    "story": [
      "Attorneys general in five Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit Thursday against the Trump administration after it said it would freeze money for several public benefit programs, citing concerns about fraud in the programs designed to help low-income families.",
      "The states \u2014 California, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois and New York \u2014 called the move an unconstitutional abuse of power. The Trump administration announced earlier this week it was withholding their social safety net funding. The funding went toward three federal programs, two of which focus on lifting families with children out of poverty.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the lawsuit, said the Trump administration is overstepping its authority by freezing billions of dollars in funds that were already approved for the states by Congress.",
      "The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York asks the courts to order the administration to halt the freeze and release the funds.",
      "\"Once again, the most vulnerable families in our communities are bearing the brunt of this administration's campaign of chaos and retribution,\" James said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week told the five states it was freezing their money for the Child Care and Development Fund, which subsidizes childcare for children from low-income families; the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance and job training; and the Social Services Block Grant.",
      "HHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In an interview with CBS News Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. because they wouldn't show the Trump administration plans for eliminating fraud.",
      "\"The best way to help poor families is to end the fraud,\" he told CBS News. Kennedy said the five states were impacted, not because they're run by Democrats, but because they \"refuse to cooperate with developing plans that would end the fraud.\"",
      "\"We gave them a warning,\" Kennedy said of the five states, claiming that the administration told them they wouldn't cut funding if they presented a plan for handling fraud.",
      "\"But if you won't show us a plan, a workable plan, we're gonna cut it off until you do,\" he said.",
      "When asked how long the funding will be cut off, Kennedy replied, \"That's up to them.\"",

      "In letters to the states, Alex J. Adams, assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, wrote that HHS had \"reason to believe\" the states were providing benefits to people who were in the U.S. illegally, offering no further details about the allegations. They requested reams of data, including the names and Social Security numbers of everyone that had received some of the benefits.",
      "\"The letters requested that California turn over essentially every document ever associated with the state's implementation of these federal programs and do so within 14 days, by Jan. 20, including personally identifiable information about program participants,\" Bonta said. \"That is deeply concerning and also deeply frustrating.\"",
      "The government intensified its focus on the childcare subsidy program after a conservative YouTuber released a video claiming day care centers in Minneapolis had committed up to $100 million in fraud.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good during an immigration operation in Minneapolis Wednesday was assigned to an enforcement and removal operations special response team, known as ERO SRT, and he was previously dragged by a car when trying to arrest a man in Bloomington, Minnesota, six months ago.",
      "In the court records from that incident, the officer is identified as Jonathan Ross.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters Wednesday the officer had been dragged by a car in an incident in June. In that incident, which took place on June 17, 2025, federal immigration officers attempted to arrest Roberto Carlos Munoz, a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, on an immigration warrant in St. Paul. As agents tried to conduct a traffic stop and take him into custody, Munoz refused orders to roll down his windows or exit the vehicle.",
      "An ICE ERO officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, Munoz put the vehicle in drive, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car as he accelerated and weaved to try to shake him off.",
      "The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. Eventually, the officer was freed when the vehicle knocked him out of the window and Munoz continued fleeing. The officer suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, and Munoz was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon. The ERO agent involved in this incident was the same agent that opened fire Thursday. He is based in Minneapolis and has over 10 years of experience.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "ICE Special Response Teams provide high-risk operational support for immigration enforcement actions, including executing arrest and search warrants, responding to barricaded subjects, transporting dangerous detainees, and assisting with riot control or disturbances at detention facilities. SRT members receive advanced training in tactical operations, firearms, defensive tactics and crowd control, and they are deployed when situations exceed the capabilities of standard ERO officers.",
      "CBS News has also asked DHS about the officer's disciplinary history.",
      "The shooting occurred at a time when agents have been accused of operating with impunity. When CBS News asked Customs and Border Protection Commander Chief Bovino late last year if any CBP or ICE agents had been disciplined as a result of recent immigration raids, he said that none had been. ICE's head of training, Caleb Vitello, also told us last month in an interview he has not seen any uptick in discipline or investigations.",
      "Under DHS policy, which was last updated in 2023, firearms may not be discharged solely to disable a moving vehicle, and shooting at a moving vehicle is tightly restricted to two narrow circumstances: When a person in the vehicle is using or imminently threatening deadly force by means other than the vehicle, or when the vehicle itself is being operated in a manner that poses an imminent threat, and no other objectively reasonable defensive option exists. This explicitly includes \"moving out of the path of the vehicle,\" the policy says.",
      "As one former senior Homeland Security Investigations agent put it: \"I've been conducting stops and approaches for 25 years \u2026 I never ever wanted to be intentionally in front of the vehicle.\"",
      "There's a tactical expectation that officers avoid self-created jeopardy and, when feasible, they're supposed to try to distance and make angles between themselves and a threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the plaintiffs behind a landmark injunction in Chicago limiting immigration agents' use of force are set to dismiss their lawsuit, even as federal officials signal renewed enforcement surges in major cities.",
      "The case curbed chemical weapons, required body cameras and clear IDs, but now ends without a final ruling. The plaintiffs are dropping their suit not because their concerns have been addressed, but because the 7th Circuit signaled it was likely to overturn it, risking a bad precedent.",
      "In practical terms, this means ICE and Border Patrol are no longer legally bound by the injunction's requirements to limit chemical agents, wear body cameras, or clearly identify themselves. The government does not admit wrongdoing and federal agents can resume the same tactics that were challenged.",
      "The Trump administration's deployment of about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area is part of a crackdown on Minnesota's fraud scandal and immigration.",

    "story": [
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey indicated Thursday that the city is united in the wake of Wednesday's shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in a residential neighborhood.",
      "\"What I appreciate about this situation right now is we in Minneapolis are all singing with one accord,\" Frey told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"Which is, one, we're gonna stand up for our immigrant community. Two, we're gonna keep people safe. And three, we're not gonna take the bait.\"",
      "Frey said his first priority was \"to keep the people of Minneapolis safe.\"",
      "\"We know that the underlying intention of ICE is not safety, it's not reducing crime, what it is, is to cause chaos and disruption in our city,\" Frey said. \"Clearly they want to deploy additional military resources, and we're not gonna take the bait.\"",
      "According to Frey, the protests that have taken place since the killing of Renee Good do not mirror the violence that engulfed Minneapolis and other U.S. cities following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.",
      "\"If you've watched how a lot of these protests have carried out, this is not some repeat of what we saw in 2020,\" Frey said. \"What we see is people saying, 'Hey, hang on one second, ICE wants us to take the bait, they want us to screw up, do something wrong, and ultimately see even greater military presence in our city.'\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, White House border czar Tom Homan said that he wanted ICE agents to be given access to local jails and prisons in order to apprehend undocumented immigrants, arguing that this would make the current situation safer.",
      "When pressed on whether he would consider opening up local jails, Frey said that \"the cities don't run the jail, the jails are under the purview of the sheriff,\" adding that mistrust exists between federal authorities and local residents and municipalities.",
      "This comes after Frey, in a news conference Wednesday, demanded that ICE \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\" The Trump administration\u00a0has surged\u00a0about 2,000 federal immigration agents to the Twin Cities area as part of both an immigration crackdown and in response to the\u00a0state's fraud scandal.",
      "\"There's not a lot of confidence in this federal administration that they are going to do the right thing, either by our immigrant community, or perhaps more importantly, under the Constitution of the United States,\" Frey said.",
      "The mayor said that the Obama administration built trust with \"mayors, chiefs and sheriffs around the country,\" something this White House has failed to do, he argued. Frey also took aim at claims from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who on Wednesday described Good's actions leading up to the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "The White House has alleged that the shooting by the ICE officer was an act of self-defense, while witnesses and local officials, including Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have disputed that claim, citing videos of the encounter that appear to show otherwise.",
      "\"There was that kind of trust built in,\" Frey said of past administrations. \"Why? Because they didn't create these B.S. narratives that we're seeing already, exactly like this one, where something horrific takes place, they, from the get-go, say this is domestic terrorism. Domestic terrorism? Give me a break, this woman was trying to leave.\"",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman Wednesday morning during an operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump described the shooting as self-defense, but the mayor and governor disputed that, citing videos from the scene.",
      "The shooting comes as the Trump administration\u00a0has deployed\u00a0about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as part of a crackdown on the\u00a0state's fraud scandal\u00a0and immigration.",
      "Here's more of what we've learned about the shooting so far.",
      "Woman who was shot, Renee Nicole Good, was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen",
      "The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time in a south Minneapolis neighborhood and found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head.",
      "Minneapolis firefighters rushed the woman to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died, the city said.",
      "The woman who was killed was identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three who had recently moved to the area with her wife and 6-year-old son.",
      "The Associated Press\u00a0reports Good had just dropped the child off at school and was driving home with her wife when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "She was a U.S. citizen, federal sources confirmed to CBS News. Minnesota city leaders said Good was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, her father, Timothy Granger, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. He said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her second husband.",
      "He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality, and as someone who always cared deeply about other people.",
      "CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0in Kansas City spoke to a former neighbor who knew Good when she lived there until 2024. She said Good lived there with her partner, their young son and their dogs, and had two older children who visited routinely. She said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\"",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, in December 2020 with an English degree, the school said.",
      "Feds say she was shot during \"targeted operations\" by ICE",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement that the shooting occurred while ICE officers were conducting \"targeted operations.\"",
      "McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several \"violent rioters\" who were \"blocking\" ICE officers.",
      "According to McLaughlin, the woman \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\"",
      "An ICE officer, \"fearing for his life,\" then \"fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and \"were attempting to push out their vehicle\" when \"a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman \"viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.",
      "Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims",
      "Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.",
      "In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account \"bull****.\"",
      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.",
      "\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz said. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"",
      "One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.",
      "In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",
      "That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.",
      "The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.",
      "Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.",
      "ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit",
      "A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team \u2014 a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.",
      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.",
      "According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Will the officer face charges or discipline?",
      "It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly\u00a0cutting state investigators out of the process.",
      "\"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,\" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.",
      "\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are \"verifiably false.\"",
      "The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" the agency said.",
      "Noem, however, said Thursday, \"They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she added.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",
      "Walz on Thursday demanded federal agents \"stay out of our schools.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The House approved a three-year extension of expired health care tax credits, with increased Republican support.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House approved on Thursday a three-year extension of health care tax credits that expired at the end of last year, with a group of Republicans joining Democrats to propel the measure to passage in the lower chamber.",
      "In a 230 to 196 vote, 17 Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. The legislation is unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form, but some lawmakers are hopeful it will serve as the starting point for a broader compromise.",
      "\"Today, let's celebrate a victory of getting something done,\" Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York told reporters Thursday. \"And then, we'll start working on the policy issue next week related to what's the common ground in the Senate that we can get to the next step.\"",
      "The outcome came after four Republicans crossed the aisle last month, revolting against their leadership to join Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. The Affordable Care Act tax credits subsidized premiums for millions of Americans who have coverage in state-run exchanges. One analysis found that premiums were set to double without the enhanced credits.",
      "The tax credits' extension was at the center of the government shutdown, which stretched through October and into November to become the longest in history. After a handful of Senate Democrats broke with their party to end the shutdown without securing an extension for the enhanced tax credits, House Democrats pushed ahead on an effort of their own \u2014 but needed GOP support to make it successful.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, led the effort to force the vote with a discharge petition in the final weeks of the year. Moderate Republicans have generally criticized a straight extension of the tax credits without reforms. But a handful of GOP members signed onto the petition, arguing that an extension of the tax credits without reforms was preferable to letting them expire.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York was one of the four Republicans who signed onto the petition last month, along with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"We endeavored in a bipartisan negotiation after the shutdown to come up with a compromise bill that would extend the subsidies, but put in place necessary reforms,\" Lawler told reporters Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, we couldn't get a vote on that before Christmas, and so the only alternative was to sign the three-year discharge.\"",
      "The moderate Republicans are banking on the measure being a vehicle for a compromise bill in the Senate.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that when we pass the discharge through the House, the Senate will be able to use that vehicle and garner enough support to get a bipartisan compromise across the finish line,\" Lawler said.",
      "The search for a Senate compromise",
      "A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs. And the discharge petition added momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise before lawmakers broke for recess in December. Now, lawmakers are looking to the Senate to move ahead with a long-sought agreement to extend the credits, with some reforms.",
      "The Senate rejected a Democrat-led effort to pass a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits last month. Republicans offered an alternative plan to send funds directly to consumers through health savings accounts that also fell short. But a number of Senate Republicans expressed willingness to reach a compromise.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who's been involved in the discussions, told reporters on Tuesday that \"we're continuing to work hard\" on a compromise measure. She said parts of the measure would be similar to what she and Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, originally proposed last month. That plan would extend the tax credits for two years, with some reforms in the first year and then \"more substantial reforms\" in the second.",
      "Moreno outlined the emerging deal Thursday, telling reporters that it would include a two-year extension of the enhanced tax credits and an extension of the open enrollment period until March 1. It would also impose a new income eligibility cap for the subsidies at 700% of the federal poverty level; a $5 per month or $60 per year minimum premium; and a $100,000 fine of insurance companies \"for deliberately causing fraud\" by signing someone up without their consent. In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account.",
      "Leaving a bicameral meeting of the so-called \"problem solvers\" on Thursday, multiple lawmakers said they expected language from the compromise bill to be released next week.",
      "Asked after Thursday's vote whether he would back such a deal, Jeffries told reporters that House Democrats are \"focused on a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits at the moment.\"",
      "\"But we've always said that we will consider in good faith anything that emerges from the Senate in a bipartisan way, if it decisively deals with the Republican health care crisis, including by providing a meaningful extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, asked about the timeline for addressing the tax credits in the upper chamber, told reporters Wednesday that the conversations among the bipartisan group of lawmakers have been productive and \"we'll see where the discussions are going.\"",
      "\"There's some thorny issues they have to resolve,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"You got to deal with reforms, you got to deal with a bridge to an HSA, and then obviously, Hyde is a big, big challenge.\"",
      "President Trump encouraged Republicans in Congress to be \"flexible\" on the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions, in order to find a solution on health care costs. But conservatives in Congress haven't expressed willingness to move on the issue, seeking additional Hyde amendment language within the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges.",
      "\"There's no flexibility. You're either using public funds to pay for abortion or you're not. We're not sure there's a compromise available on that,\" Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Thune said while Collins and Moreno are trying to address the challenging issues, there isn't \"a landing spot just yet.\"",
      "\"The conversations are constructive,\" he added. \"But at this point, there's nothing that I'm aware of that we'll be voting on soon.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has unveiled a new food pyramid and dietary guidelines for Americans that call for \"prioritizing high-quality protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains\" while avoiding highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.",
      "\"As secretary of Health and Human Services, my message is clear: Eat real food,\" HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at a White House briefing announcing the changes alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and other health officials. Kennedy called it \"the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News the new guidelines are \"science-driven.\" In a fact sheet, the administration said the new guidelines would restore \"science and common sense\" and put \"real food back at the center of health.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the new dietary guidelines.",
      "First recommended limits on highly processed foods",
      "For the first time, the recommendations are calling for Americans to avoid eating\u00a0highly processed foods.",
      "A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 55% of the U.S. population receives more than half of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. The previous 2020-2025 dietary guidelines did not mention highly processed or ultra-processed foods.",
      "The new guidelines call for avoiding \"highly processed packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet,\" as well as avoiding sweetened beverages including soda, fruit drinks and energy drinks.",
      "Research has shown\u00a0diets high in ultra-processed food are associated with an increased risk of 32 damaging health outcomes, according to a review published in\u00a0The BMJ\u00a0medical journal in 2024.",
      "Limits on sugars, artificial flavors and dyes",
      "The guidelines also say that \"no amount of added sugars\" are recommended for Americans, especially children.",
      "At most, a meal should contain no more than 10 grams of added sugars, according to the new guidance. The former guidance said children under 2 should\u00a0not consume added sugars and that Americans should aim to have less than 10% of their daily calories come from added sugars.",
      "People should also limit foods and beverages that include\u00a0artificial flavors, dyes, low-calorie non-nutritive sweeteners and artificial preservatives, the new guidelines said.",
      "Naturally occurring sugars are not considered added sugars and can be part of a recommended diet under the new guidelines.",
      "Fighting chronic disease and supporting gut health",
      "Dietary guidelines are used as the baseline for federal food programs, including SNAP and school meal programs. The fact sheet for the new guidelines says public adherence to the new guidelines \"will dramatically lower chronic disease \u2014 and healthcare costs \u2014 for Americans.\"",
      "The fact sheet said the U.S.'s high level of health-related spending and a life expectancy that is five years less than other developed countries is \"predominantly due to chronic conditions tied to food.\" It also said that lowering rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease would cut about $600 billion in annual healthcare costs. Previous studies have also shown a possible link between diet and Alzheimer's.",
      "\"The most expensive thing we can do as a country is continue government incentives for food that sickens Americans and drives up healthcare costs,\" the fact sheet said.",
      "The new guidelines point out the importance of gut health\u00a0and the microbiome inside a person's intestines. The gut microbiome includes trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi whose balance is important for good health. The new guidelines call for the consumption of vegetables, fruits, fermented foods and high-fiber foods to support a diverse gut microbiome.",

      "The fact sheet for the new guidance calls for \"ending the war on healthy fats\" and getting the bulk of dietary fats from whole food sources. That includes meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, full-fat dairy and avocados, the guidelines say.",
      "People should aim for three servings of dairy a day, in line with the 2020-2025 guidelines. The new guidelines say people should prioritize full-fat options, while the previous guidelines recommended fat-free or low-fat products.",
      "The new guidelines also recommend olive oil, butter or beef tallow for preparing meals. Kennedy has previously criticized seed oils and extolled tallow, at odds with long-standing recommendations.",
      "\"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said.",
      "In total, saturated fat consumption should not exceed more than 10% of a person's daily calories, according to the new guidelines. The 2020-2025 guidelines also had similar recommended limits on saturated fats, though they noted a \"healthy dietary pattern\" could include vegetable oils.",
      "A focus on protein and \"real\" foods",
      "The new guidelines recommend \"high-quality, nutrient dense protein foods\" including eggs, poultry, seafood, red meat, and plant-based proteins like beans, nuts and seeds in every meal.",
      "Under the guidelines, Americans should aim to eat 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight every day. Proteins should be served with no or limited added sugars, chemical additives, refined carbohydrates or starches, the guidelines say.",
      "\"What we're stressing is that people should be eating protein,\" Kennedy said in an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary noted at the briefing that the new guidelines increase the recommended amount of protein for children.",
      "\"Kids need protein,\" Makary said. \"The old protein guidelines were to prevent starvation and withering away. These new protein guidelines are designed for American kids to thrive.\"",
      "Fruits, vegetables and whole grains",
      "The new guidelines also recommend people eat at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit per day, in line with the previous 2020-2025 dietary guidance.",
      "People should eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, preferably in their original form. Frozen, dried or canned products with no or very limited added sugars \"can also be good options,\" according to the fact sheet. People should limit consumption of 100% fruit or vegetable juices.",
      "Americans should also prioritize fiber-rich whole grains and reduce the consumption of highly processed, refined carbs, the guidelines say. People should aim for between two and four servings of whole grains per day.",
      "A new food pyramid",
      "Officials introduced a new version of the food pyramid, with protein, dairy, healthy fats making up one of the top corners, fruits and vegetables in the other, and whole grains at the bottom.",
      "Consume less alcohol",
      "The guidelines recommend that Americans should \"consume less alcohol for better overall health.\"",
      "People in certain categories are urged to completely avoid alcohol, including pregnant women, people who are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are unable to control the amount they drink, and people taking medications or with medical conditions that can interact with alcohol.",
      "Previous guidelines said that Americans should not drink or drink in moderation. The recommended limits were 2 drinks or less per day for men and 1 drink or less per day for women on days when alcohol is consumed.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the new guidelines are meant to encourage moderation but acknowledge the social benefits that some may experience.",
      "\"There is alcohol on these guidelines, but the implication is don't have it for breakfast,\" Oz said.",
      "Reactions to new dietary guidance",
      "The American Medical Association said in a statement that it \"applauds\" the Trump administration's new dietary guidelines.",
      "\"The guidelines affirm that food is medicine and offer clear direction patients and physicians can use to improve health,\" Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, the president of the AMA, said in the statement. Kennedy thanked Mukkamala in his briefing.",
      "The AMA said it will launch a collection of educational resources and hold a series of roundtable discussions with doctors and experts to \"strengthen nutrition education and clinical competency.\" It also pledged to work with Congress to incentivize the consumption of nutrient-dense foods, expand food labeling efforts, define ultra-processed foods and increase investment in nutrition research.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-venezuela-oil-assets-theft-explainer/",
    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:13:13 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:53:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei strikes a defiant tone against the U.S. after a night of massive anti-government protests.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of Iranians flooded the streets of Tehran and other cities Thursday night, heeding a call by the country's exiled crown prince to make their voices heard in the most serious challenge to the Islamic Republic's hardline rulers in many years.",
      "The protests had spread across the country for 13 days, leaving about 65 people dead and more than 2,300 detained by security forces,\u00a0according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, but despite the arrests and a nationwide internet and phone service blackout, the unrest escalated dramatically on Thursday night and into Friday.",
      "The protests have now spread to 180 cities in all 31 of the nation's provinces, according to the HRANA.",
      "It was impossible to get a clear picture of the extent of the unrest, given the clamp down on the flow of information. But Iran's ruler appeared in a brief television address on Friday morning, defiantly accusing President Trump of inspiring the protests, showing he remained in charge, and vowing that his regime would \"not back down.\"",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran, where a state TV building was set alight, of having \"destroyed a building that belongs to them to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "As he spoke, an audience in front of him shouted the familiar refrain of \"Death to America!\"",
      "Given the communications blackout, which continued Friday morning according to the NetBlocks internet monitoring organization, short videos posted online, largely by anti-regime activists, provided the only real window into the chaos across the country.",
      "It appeared to ramp up dramatically from 8 p.m. local time on Thursday, the moment at which exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi had urged Iranians to shout and chant from their windows against the regime.",
      "\"Iranians demanded their freedom tonight,\" said Pahlavi, the son of the former head of state Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled the country just before the 1979 Islamic revolution that brought the current regime to power.",
      "In statements posted online, he called for European leaders to join Mr. Trump to \"hold the regime to account,\" using \"all technical, financial, and diplomatic resources available to restore communication to the Iranian people so that their voice and their will can be heard and seen. Do not let the voices of my courageous compatriots be silenced.\"",
      "Speaking at the White House Friday, Mr. Trump reiterated, as he has in recent days, that he was open to some kind of U.S.\u00a0 intervention in Iran, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "On Friday, Pahlavi made a direct appeal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"I have called the people to the streets to fight for their freedom and to overwhelm the security forces with sheer numbers. Last night they did that. Your threat to this criminal regime has also kept the regime's thugs at bay. But time is of the essence. The people will be on the streets again in an hour. I am asking you to help,\" Pahlavi said on social media. \"You have proven and I know you are a man of peace and a man of your word. Please be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran.\"",
      "Pahlavi issued his initial call several days earlier for mass chanting against the regime at 8 p.m., which is noon on the East Coast of the United States, on both Thursday and Friday.",
      "In the videos, which are difficult to independently verify, many people could be heard chanting \"Death to the dictator!\" and \"Death to the Islamic Republic,\" while others called for a return of the monarchy, declaring: \"Pahlavi will return!\"",
      "As of Thursday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of contacts inside the country, said at least 42 people had been killed and more than 2,270 others detained, but that was before a clear picture could be gained of the chaos on Thursday night and Friday morning.",
      "\"All of the huge crowds in my neighborhood are pro-Pahlavi and from several areas my sources report the same \u2014 pro-Pahlavi crowds are prevailing, undeniably,\" one source in Tehran told CBS News on Thursday night, calling it \"monarchists responding to Reza,\" before his communications were cut off.",
      "\"For the first time, the government decided to shut the internet yesterday, and usually when they shut the Internet, it means that they're going to use violence against people,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Bahari said activists and journalists outside Iran had heard reports of security forces shooting at people in different parts of the country, but that the information was impossible to verify. Other CBS News sources, both people inside the country and those in contact with family in Iran, said there did not appear to have been massive, widespread violence on Thursday evening, but they stressed that it was difficult to get a clear picture amid the communications cuts.",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Bahari said, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Bahari said this would likely result in the \"incarceration of hundreds or even thousands of protesters. It's gonna lead to torture and interrogation of thousands of protestors, into killing of the protestors. But it has not prevented protests in the past. People have continued to protest, and this time, because the middle classes - the traditional bazaar merchants - they have joined the young people, I think the protests, it will be very difficult for the regime to stop.\"",
      "How might Iran respond?",
      "\"Many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution, and we can see different signs of revolution in Iran at the moment, but a revolution usually needs a leader for the revolution \u2026 We don't have that leader,\" said Bahari, who was working as a journalist in Iran in 2009 when a previous round of massive protests swept across the country. He was arrested and detained for over 100 days.",
      "He said he expects the protests to continue, regardless of any steps the regime takes to crack down, which he said could vary significantly based on the whims of local and regional commanders.",
      "\"I think people are more desperate than before. In 2009, the economic situation was not as bad as it is now,\" Bahari said. \"In 2009 the protests were really about dignity and citizen rights. In 2022, the 'woman life freedom' [movement] was mainly about the rights of women to determine their own destinies. But I think these protests, they are about the economic situation, but also about dignity. It's about the national pride. And because of that, these protests will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "\"I was very lucky that I was a journalist for a foreign publication at that time \u2026 and because of that, I wasn't treated the same way that unknown prisoners were treated,\" Bahari told CBS News.",
      "But despite his status as \"a VIP prisoner,\" Bahari said he was \"tortured physically. I was tortured psychologically. I was threatened with execution. And I know for a fact that many of the protesters in 2009 who were arrested with me and did not have my profile, they were treated much more harshly by the prison guards in different parts of the country.\"",
      "\"Iranian people, they do not lack bravery. They lack leadership in terms of opposing the government,\" Bahari said. \"But at the same time, many of the protesters, they have nothing to lose. Their rate of suicide in the past couple of decades in Iran is really high. And when you're suicidal, when you have nothing to lose, you don't care about what may happen to you in a protest. So you just come out and ask for your rights.\"",
      "Echoing Khamenei, Iran's state-controlled media on Friday accused \"terrorist agents\" of the U.S. and Israel of causing the violence. It acknowledged casualties, but gave no details.",
      "The protests began on December 28 as merchants in Tehran closed their shops and took to the streets to vent anger over Iran's long-ailing economy, which has been hobbled for years by global isolation and a raft of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations over its nuclear program and backing of armed proxy groups across the region.",
      "Iran's autocratic regime has quashed several previous waves of unrest, violently, and the source in Tehran told CBS News there was significant fear among many people that the current protests would draw a similar draconian crackdown.",
      "This time, however, the protests are playing out under the threat of a direct U.S. intervention by President Trump.",
      "\"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots \u2014 they have lots of riots \u2014 if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday during a radio interview.",
      "Vice President JD Vance told reporters at the White House that the U.S. stood by anyone engaged in peaceful protests in Iran. Asked if the U.S. would, as it did over the summer, join in any new Israeli strikes on Iran, Vance called on Tehran to negotiate with Washington over its nuclear program, but said he would \"let the president speak to what we're going to do in the future.\"",
      "Bahari said that Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before these protests.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",

    "summary": "Many Iranian opposition activists are hoping the current unrest could be the beginning of the end of the country's hardline Islamic regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for nearly two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with about 180 cities facing demonstrations. One monitoring group has reported thousands of arrests and dozens of deaths since the protests began.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "As of Friday, protests were reported in at least 180 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",
      "Demonstrations have also been reported on dozens of university campuses since late December, and strikes and shop closures were reported in markets in over a dozen cities, HRANA said.",
      "Videos posted on social media virtually every night have shown crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",
      "How Iranian authorities have responded",
      "More than 2,300 people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began, including at least 167 under the age of 18, according to HRANA. Some 65 people have been killed, the group said, including 50 protesters, at least seven people under the age of 18 and 14 members of the security services.",
      "The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and web access Thursday night across the country, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks, which said a \"nationwide internet blackout\" continued on Friday.",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Trump warns he'll hit Iran \"very hard\" if it kills protesters",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened on several occasions since the protests began that he could order a U.S. intervention if Iranian authorities kill demonstrators.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" the president said.",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage.",
      "U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power, has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Thursday and Friday, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "Pahlavi's call to action \"could be a turning point\" in the protest movement, Yacoubian told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

      "Sion, Switzerland \u2014 Jacques Moretti, co-owner of the Swiss bar that went up in a deadly blaze during a New Year celebration, was held in custody after being interviewed by prosecutors on Friday, a prosecutor said. The Swiss Valais region's chief prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said in a statement that Moretti's detention was necessary to avoid a \"risk of flight.\"",

      "Entering the enclosed space, Mekrabech delicately placed the roses.",
      "\"I brought 40. One for each of the victims,\" he told AFP.",
      "Eight days on from the tragedy at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana, which left 40 dead and 116 injured, Switzerland marked a national day of mourning for the mostly teenage victims.",
      "Mekrabech, 30, had come from Lyon, in neighboring France. He was one of many who traveled from afar to mark the occasion in the snow-blanketed ski resort where the tragedy occurred.",
      "\"I'm someone who likes to party quite a bit. It made me think of myself. I thought, I could have been at a party without paying attention and been trapped like that,\" he said. \"I saw myself ... I felt I had to make the gesture.\"",
      "He and others said they would watch the national memorial ceremony, being live-streamed on giant screens in Crans-Montana from Martigny, down the Rhone valley. Several heads of state from the European nations that had citizens killed in the blaze attended the service.",
      "At the Crans-Montana congress center, which was used in the days after the tragedy to accommodate family members desperately seeking information about their missing loved ones, around 1,400 people gathered to view the ceremony, many sobbing quietly.",

    "story": [
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro told CBS News on Thursday predicted Venezuela would \"implode\" if the U.S. is in charge of the South American nation for years, as President Trump recently suggested.",
      "Petro's remarks came in response to Mr. Trump's\u00a0remark to the New York Times that he expected U.S. oversight of Venezuela to last \"much longer\" than a year.",
      "\"If that happens, Venezuelan society will implode,\" Petro said.",
      "\"And there's a crucial point that's not so much about Venezuela, but about the idea that the United States has a right over the resources of not only Latin America, but the world,\" Petro added.",
      "The Trump administration has said the U.S. plans to take control of selling Venezuela's oil and is pushing American companies to invest billions in rebuilding Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Mr. Trump is meeting with oil executives at the White House Friday to discuss the issue.",
      "Petro and Mr. Trump spoke for the first time Wednesday after the U.S. leader threatened military action against Colombia as part of his crackdown on the flow of narcotics into the country. The call appeared to ease the escalating tensions between the two leaders, and Mr. Trump invited Petro to the White House.",
      "Petro was critical of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who Mr. Trump said he plans to meet with next week. When asked if he would trust or support her as a leader of Venezuela, Petro said, \"I invited her once, and she didn't want to come. I was obviously surprised that Trump thought the same thing as me.\"",
      "After the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mr. Trump said he didn't believe Machado had enough support inside her country to be a viable leader. Instead, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has been sworn in as interim president.",
      "But among the opposition, Machado was polling at 93% ahead in an election last year in which Maduro claimed a decisive victory that the U.S. and Machado say he stole. While the Maduro regime blocked Machado from running, the candidate she backed is believed by the U.S. and many outside observers to have won 70% of the vote.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists say all signs indicate the so-called \"megaberg\" could be just days or weeks from totally disintegrating.",
    "story": [
      "One of the largest and oldest icebergs ever tracked by scientists has turned blue and is \"on the verge of complete disintegration,\" NASA said on Thursday.",
      "A23a, a massive wall of ice that was once twice the size of Rhode Island, is drenched in blue meltwater as it drifts in the South Atlantic off the eastern tip of South America, NASA said in a news release.",
      "A NASA satellite captured an image of the fading berg the day after Christmas, showing pools of blue meltwater on its surface. A day later, an astronaut aboard the International Space Station captured a photograph showing a closer view of the iceberg, with an even larger melt pool.",
      "The satellite image suggests that the A23a has also \"sprung a leak,\" NASA said, as the weight of the water pooling at the top of the berg punched through the ice.",
      "Scientists say all signs indicate the so-called \"megaberg\" could be just days or weeks from totally disintegrating as it rides currents that are pushing it toward even warmer waters. Warmer air temperatures during this season could also speed up A23a's demise in an area that ice experts have dubbed a \"graveyard\" for icebergs.",
      "\"I certainly don't expect A-23A to last through the austral summer,\" \u00a0retired University of Maryland, Baltimore County scientist Chris Shuman said in a statement.",
      "Blue and white linear patterns visible on A23a are likely related to striations, which are ridges that were scoured hundreds of years ago when the iceberg was part of the Antarctic bedrock, NASA said.",
      "\"The striations formed parallel to the direction of flow, which ultimately created subtle ridges and valleys on the top of the iceberg that now direct the flow of meltwater,\" said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow & Ice Data Center.",
      "When the berg detached from Antarctica in 1986, it was about 4,000 square kilometers and hosted a Soviet research station. It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its slow journey north sometimes held up by ocean forces that stopped its movement.",
      "In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a\u00a0time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement. In January 2025, it was on a collision course with a remote penguin colony but fortunately, it did not make impact.",
      "Last summer, multiple large chunks of ice broke off A23a as it moved into relatively warm summer conditions. According to current estimates\u00a0from the U.S. National Ice Center, in early January 2026, the berg's area is 1,182 square kilometers -- still larger than New York City but a fraction of its initial size.",
      "\"I'm incredibly grateful that we've had the satellite resources in place that have allowed us to track it and document its evolution so closely,\" said Shuman. \"A-23A faces the same fate as other Antarctic bergs, but its path has been remarkably long and eventful. It's hard to believe it won't be with us much longer.\"",

He did not mention Venezuela. He did not mention any specifics, but rather we talked about a procedure to restore communication.",
      "Luciano: He did not talk about Venezuela, but there was a discussion about Venezuela. He didn't give you any specifics, but you did talk about Venezuela. What did you talk about? He did not give any specifics about Venezuela. What does that mean, and what was said about Venezuela?",

      "Luciano: He's waiting to have that conversation?",
      "Petro: \u200aIf there has been no communication throughout his entire term, rebuilding it is undoubtedly not easy and is the first thing that needs to be done. The figures may be disputed, but they should be official, and any falsehoods should be exposed.",

    "summary": "Britain's leader says all options on the table if Musk's X platform doesn't stop Grok AI tool being used to generate non-consensual sexualized images.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese authorities applied an 1889 anti-dueling law to arrest a man over a fight that resulted in his opponent's death in Tokyo's red light and entertainment district, police said Friday.",
      "The faceoff took place on a street in September in the Kabukicho area of the capital after the suspect \"and the dead man agreed to fight each other,\" police spokesman Mitsuhiro Hirota told AFP.",
      "Tokyo police on Wednesday arrested Fuzuki Asari, 26, unemployed, on suspicion of having \"conspired with someone else\" to have a duel and causing injury resulting in the death of his 30-year-old adversary, Hirota said.",
      "The suspect \"committed acts of violence such as throwing\" the opponent, Naoya Matsuda, who \"died on October 12 at a hospital in Tokyo ... of multiple organ failure\" caused by head injuries, the spokesman said.",
      "The crime was investigated and announced by the Tokyo police's organized crime control division, he said.",
      "After he was arrested, Asari allegedly admitted to the allegations, saying: \"I am deeply sorry that my opponent died,\" according to the Tokyo Reporter.",
      "It was not specified whether any weapons were involved in the fight. The Tokyo Reporter, citing police, said Asari met the victim for the first time on the day of the fight.",
      "The 1889 law stipulates that \"anyone who has engaged in a duel shall be punished by imprisonment for no less than two years and no more than five years.\"",
      "The suspect's other alleged crime \u2014 causing death from involuntary injury \u2014 would lead to no less than three years in prison, according to Japan's criminal law.",
      "Although it is rare to apply the anti-dueling statute in Japan, there was a case in October when police in Gunma prefecture north of Tokyo arrested a high-school student and a man on suspicion of dueling, the Asahi Shimbun reported.",
      "In 2007, a deadly shootout in West Virginia led police to file a rare charge of \"murder by duel.\" The law, written in 1849, reads: \"If any person fight a duel in this state and in so doing inflict a mortal wound, he shall be deemed guilty of murder.\" West Virginia became a state in 1863.",

    "summary": "Russia says it used its new Oreshnik hypersonic missile and other weapons in a massive strike on Ukraine\u200b. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says a drone hit the Qatar embassy.",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv, Ukraine \u2014 Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in a large-scale overnight attack, officials said Friday, killing at least four people. For only the second time, it used a new hypersonic missile it says flies at 10 times the speed of sound and is unstoppable.",
      "Ukraine's security service said it considered the use of the missile a war crime.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media that a Russian drone hit the Qatar embassy. He noted that Qatar has played a key role in mediating the exchange of prisoners of war.",
      "The intense barrage and the launching of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a peace deal is struck to end Russia's almost 4-year-old invasion.",
      "Months of U.S.-led peace efforts have failed to stop the fighting, however. Zelenskyy says he has made significant progress on the terms of a possible peace settlement in talks with Washington envoys. But Moscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its demands.",
      "The attack also coincides with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. It comes as President Trump has signaled he's on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow.",
      "Zelenskyy called for a \"clear response\" to the attack from the international community, particularly from the United States, which he said Russia takes seriously.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said the assault was a retaliation to what Moscow said was a Ukrainian drone strike on Russian President Vladimir Putin's residence last month. But both Ukraine and Mr. Trump have rejected the Russian claim of the attack on Putin's residence.",
      "Ukrainian officials said four people were killed and at least 25 wounded in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, during the overnight attack as apartment buildings were struck. Zelenskyy said an ambulance crew member was among the dead and put the number of apartment buildings damaged at 20.",
      "Four doctors and one police officer sustained injuries while responding to the ongoing attacks, authorities said.",
      "About half of snowy Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - were left without heat, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. The water supply was also disrupted.",
      "With temperatures of about 17 degrees Fahrenheit and expected to drop further, Klitschko made an exceptional call on social media for \"residents of the capital who have the opportunity to temporarily leave the city for places with alternative sources of power and heat to do so,\" French news agency AFP reported.",
      "Municipal services restored power and heating to public facilities, including hospitals and maternity wards, using mobile boiler units, he said.",
      "Putin has previously said that the Oreshnik streaks to its target at Mach 10, \"like a meteorite\" and has claimed it's immune to any missile defense system. Several of the missiles used in a conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack, according to Putin, who has warned the West that Russia could use it next against allies of Kyiv that allow it to strike inside Russia with their longer-range missiles.",
      "Ukrainian intelligence says the missile has six warheads, each carrying six submunitions.",
      "The Reuters news agency quotes a senior Ukrainian official as saying the one used in the attack was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads, and Moscow itself said on Telegram that it either had no warheads or a very small one.",
      "Russia didn't say where the Oreshnik hit, but Russian media and military bloggers said it targeted a huge underground natural gas storage facility in Ukraine's western Lviv region. Western military aid flows to Ukraine from a big supply hub in Poland just across the border from Lviv.",
      "Russia first used the Oreshnik missile on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024. Analysts say it affords Russia a new element of psychological warfare, unnerving Ukrainians and scaring Western countries that supply weaponry to Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Ukraine would be initiating international action in response to the use of the missile, including an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council and a meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council.",
      "\"Such a strike close to EU and NATO border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community. We demand strong responses to Russia's reckless actions,\" he said in a post on X.",
      "Pope Leo XIV, speaking at the Vatican on Friday, urged the international community to keep pushing for peace and end the suffering in Ukraine.",
      "\"Faced with this tragic situation, the Holy See strongly reiterates the pressing need for an immediate ceasefire, and for dialogue motivated by a sincere search for ways leading to peace,\" the pontiff told ambassadors to the Vatican from around the world.",

      "Fewer than one percent of mountain gorilla pregnancies result in twins, according to scientists, with the DRC recording a previous case in 2020, also in the UNESCO-listed Virunga reserve. In\u00a0 social media post, the park called it a \u00a0\"rare and remarkable event.\"",
      "\"The two newborns are both male,\" park official Methode Uhoze told AFP by phone on Thursday.",

      "The twins were born to a 22-year-old female named Mafuko, who is part of the Bageni family of mountain gorillas, the park said. There are now 59 members in the family, the largest in the reserve.",
      "Mafuko has given birth to a total of seven newborns, including a set of twins in 2016, but those twins died a week after birth, the reserve said.",
      "Mafuko was born into the Kabirizi family in 2003 but her mother was shot dead 2007, according to the park.\u00a0 In 2013, the Kabirizi family split, and Mafuko joined the Bageni family. Three years later, her sister Tumaini joined the family, the park said.",

    "summary": "Iran faced a \"nationwide internet blackout,\" a monitoring group said, amid hope that 12 days of deadly protests may swell into a tipping point against a repressive regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and internet access Thursday in the capital and in several parts of the country as mass protests and chanting against the government\u00a0continue, with dozens of people killed in the demonstrations and thousands arrested. Multiple sources in Tehran told CBS News the internet was down in the capital.",
      "The NetBlocks monitoring organization said\u00a0Thursday evening local time in Iran that its live data showed Iran was \"now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout; the incident  follows a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting  protests across the country and hinders the public's right to  communicate at a critical moment.\"",
      "Attempts to dial landlines and mobile phones from Dubai to Iran could not be connected, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Security forces confronted protesters in several cities and towns, firing tear gas. One CBS News source in the capital said there were \"huge crowds out across Tehran. Unprecedented,\" and confirmed that the internet was down for most people in the city. He said some people, with more robust, more reliable business accounts could still get online. Not long after, that source became unreachable, suggesting the blackout had widened even further.",
      "There were reports on social media, largely by anti-regime activists, that web service was also down or severely restricted in the cities of Esfahan, Lodegan, Abdanan, and parts of Shiraz.",
      "The web outages came as Iranians began chanting out of their windows against the regime, following a call by exiled Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former U.S.-backed shah, to make their voices heard at 8 p.m. local time (noon Eastern). Analysts and insiders told CBS News the scale of the response to Pahalvi's call could determine whether the deadly,\u00a012-day-old protests\u00a0fizzle out as previous rounds of unrest have, or grow into a major challenge to the government, and provoke a possible wider crackdown.",
      "\"All of the huge crowds in my neighborhood are pro-Pahlavi and from several areas my sources report the same \u2014 pro-Pahlavi crowds are prevailing, undeniably,\" the source in Tehran told CBS News, calling it \"monarchists responding to Reza.\"",
      "So far, the unrest has left at least 42 people dead, including at least four members of the security services, and seen more than 2,260 others detained, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "President Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Thursday that his administration is monitoring the protests in Iran. He threatened to take severe action if authorities kill protesters.",
      "\"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots \u2014 they have lots of riots \u2014 if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Speaking to reporters Thursday at the White House, Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. stands by anybody in Iran engaged in peaceful protest. Asked if the U.S. would take part in any Israeli strikes on Iran, Vance called on Iran to have real negotiations with the U.S. over their nuclear program.",
      "\"I'll let the president speak to what we're going to do in the future,\" Vance said.",
      "NetBlocks said earlier that its \"data show the loss of connectivity on #Iran  internet backbone provider TCI in the restive city of Kermanshah as  protests spread across the nation in their 12th day; the incident comes  amid rising casualties with indications of disruptions in multiple  regions.\"",
      "Iranian authorities regularly restrict or disable internet access when they expect significant protests or other potentially destabilizing events.",
      "President Mahsoud Pezeshkian, seen as a reformer but subordinate to Iran's longtime Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, intimated ahead of his election in 2024 that he would free up the internet and make more websites accessible. It remains tightly restricted, however. Social media sites such as TikTok, Facebook and X are officially banned, as is access to U.S. and European news sites, including CBS News.",
      "Many young, tech-savvy Iranians have become adept at getting around the restrictions, but it's a cumbersome process, and when the regime slows down internet speeds at politically sensitive times, the whole system can become unusable.",

      "But as the aircraft drew closer to the heavily fortified compound where Maduro was believed to be holed up, the calm broke. Venezuelan defensive positions opened fire, and U.S. helicopters responded with their own suppressive fire, according to the U.S. officials.",

      "Washington \u2014 After two previous unsuccessful attempts, the Senate moved Thursday toward limiting President Trump's ability to further strike\u00a0Venezuela as the U.S. leader continues to take unilateral action against the South American country.",
      "The Senate voted 52 to 47 to advance a war powers resolution, days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife in a nighttime raid that came not only as a surprise to the former president, but also to Congress.",
      "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure: Todd Young of Indiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri.",
      "Another procedural vote and debate on the resolution is expected next week.",
      "Mr. Trump had long teased land strikes against Venezuela amid a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats at sea that has killed more than 100 people. Mr. Trump has not ruled out additional military action. He has said that the U.S. will \"run\" the country for the time being and control its oil sales after Saturday's strikes, which were carried out as part of a daring operation to capture Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face charges.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, introduced his latest resolution in early December, after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "\"The indication from the administration [is] that this is not a few days or a few weeks, it's likely a few years of U.S. occupation and involvement in this country,\" Kaine said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"This is not an arrest warrant. This is far bigger than that.\"",
      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, held briefings for top lawmakers on Tuesday on last weekend's actions in the region. They held similar briefings for all members of Congress on Wednesday.",
      "Democrats left those briefings dissatisfied with the answers they received about what comes next.",
      "The boat strikes and Maduro's seizure and removal to the U.S. have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers, with some accusing the Trump administration of committing war crimes, lying about its intentions for regime change and leading the U.S. into a war without congressional authorization.",
      "\"I think bombing a capital and removing the head of state is by all definitions, war,\" Paul, the lone Republican cosponsor of the resolution, said Tuesday.",
      "Members of the Trump administration, including the president, have muddied the legal arguments by claiming that the operation to capture Maduro was a \"law enforcement\" operation that didn't require sign-off from Congress. Mr. Trump and other officials also say the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela.",
      "Republicans who voted to advance the resolution cited Mr. Trump's comments about running Venezuela and the potential for U.S. forces to be deployed there as reasons for the measure gaining their support.",
      "\"I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the president's comments about the possibility of 'boots on the ground' and a sustained engagement 'running' Venezuela, with which I do not agree,\" Collins said in a statement.",
      "\"A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump's goal of ending foreign entanglements,\" Young said in statement.",
      "Hawley told reporters after the vote, \"I just think if you're going to put troops in there for hostilities, you're going to have to get congressional approval.\"",
      "Many Republicans have defended the Trump administration's failure to seek approval from Congress, arguing the actions are well within the president's constitutional authority and limited in scope.",
      "\"This is not a regime change. This is demand for change of behavior by a regime,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said after Monday's classified briefing. \"We don't expect troops on the ground.\"",
      "Johnson added Wednesday, \"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. There's no dispute about that, of course, but we are not in a war in Venezuela.\"",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho called the resolution \"nonsense,\" and said \"the effect of this is to slap the president of the United States in the face.\"",
      "\"That is the only effect that this vote can have. It can have no practical effect, because it's trying to stop something that isn't going on,\" Risch added.",
      "Boat strikes scrutinized",
      "In the weeks before Maduro's capture, Mr. Trump dialed up his pressure campaign, seizing two sanctioned tankers that were carrying oil from Venezuela. On Wednesday, the U.S. carried out operations to seize two more vessels linked to Venezuela.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has voted against the war powers resolutions, suggested that if the U.S. can seize a giant oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, it could also seize smaller boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "\"I would take note, if we can take a big ship like this, we may be able to take a few boats, too, without blowing them out of the water,\" he told reporters last month. \"But that's a decision they have to make on the ground, I guess, based on the threat level.\"",
      "Paul, who has been a fierce critic of the strikes and has decried the lack of due process, shared a letter he received from the U.S. Coast Guard that said dozens of suspected drug smuggling vessels interdicted by the military branch possessed no illegal drugs. In total, 212 interdictions occurred between Sept. 1, 2024, and Oct. 7, 2025, according to the letter. Of those, 41 boats had \"no illicit contraband on board when interdicted,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "The letter also provided details on interceptions in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"Of the 212 total vessels interdicted during this period, 69 vessels were interdicted in the Caribbean Sea by Coast Guard surface assets, operating under Coast Guard law enforcement authority,\" the letter continued. \"Of these 69 interdictions, 14 had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted; 11 of those 14 vessels without contraband did not appear to commit any federal criminal offense. Of the 69 Caribbean interdictions, 14 vessels were indicted off the coast of Venezuela. Three of the 14 vessels interdicted near Venezuela had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted, but one of the three violated other U.S. federal criminal statutes.\"",
      "To justify the strikes, the Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. Lawmakers critical of the military action argue the rationale in the opinion is inadequate for the situation and have demanded that it be made public.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" perhaps seeking to bolster the justification for military action around Venezuela.",

    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",

      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",
      "A brief history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency.",
      "It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, and the European nation carried on as a colonial ruler of Greenland until 1953, when it fully laid out its relations with the island as a semi-autonomous territory.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:06:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first ever American leader, appears to signal a more inclusive leadership style than his predecessor.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014\u00a0Pope Leo XIV has summoned Catholic cardinals from around the world to the Vatican for a meeting called an \"extraordinary consistory,\" to seek their guidance on the Catholic Church's priorities for the years ahead.",
      "\"I am here to listen,\" Leo, a Chicago native and the first ever pope from the U.S., said Wednesday in his opening remarks. \"This day-and-a-half together will point the way for our path ahead.\"",
      "Of the 245 members of the College of Cardinals, 170 of the so-called \"princes of the church\" were in Vatican City to participate in the gathering.",
      "As it got underway, Leo asked the cardinals to select two of four possible topics for detailed discussions: The missionary nature of the church, further reforms of the Vatican bureaucracy, synodality and liturgy.",
      "A majority chose to prioritize the missionary and synodal themes over the liturgy or Vatican reforms, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. That means the consistory is likely to focus on how to make the church more missionary, and more responsive to the needs of the faithful.",
      "Significantly, the cardinals chose not to discuss liturgy, which would likely have seen them grapple with divisions within the church over the celebration of the traditional Latin Mass, which became a flashpoint after Pope Francis significantly restricted its use.",
      "The Latin Mass \u2014   also known as the Tridentine mass \u2014 is controversial because it represents a form of Catholic worship that some say is out of touch with modern sensibilities. It is celebrated entirely in Latin, with the priest facing the altar and the faithful receiving communion on the tongue while kneeling. Critics argue that it can feel inaccessible and limits parishioners' participation, while supporters say it is a sacred preservation of tradition.",
      "Merely by convening the consistory, Pope Leo's has underscored his commitment to involving the full College of Cardinals in governance of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.4 billion followers worldwide according to the Vatican.",
      "By contrast, during his 12-year papacy, Pope Francis held only one extraordinary consistory, instead relying primarily on a small group of hand-picked advisors to help him plot the church's course \u2014 a practice that left some cardinals feeling sidelined.",
      "Since his election at the papal conclave in May, the American pontiff's tenure has largely been shaped by commitments inherited from Francis, including the major events of the 2025 Holy Year.",
      "By convening the consistory immediately after those Holy Year events, Leo appears to be signaling the unofficial launch of his own pontificate, and charting a course aligned with his priorities.",
      "Leo signalled on Wednesday that his papacy would be progressive, calling the Second Vatican Council \u2014 a landmark gathering in the 1960s known as Vatican II that was seen as a significant move to modernize the Catholic Church \u2014   the \"guiding star\" of the Church's journey under his leadership.",
      "Among other things, Vatican II allowed for mass to be celebrated in local languages, not just the traditional Latin. It also introduced simpler rites and encouraged more participation by active lay people in congregations, and cemented improved relations between Catholics, Jews and people of other faiths, and promoting the church's engagement with the modern world.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

    "summary": "As Iran struggles to quell protests that have reportedly killed almost 40 people, its new army chief says Tehran is ready for a military confrontation.",
    "story": [
      "Iran's leaders faced another day of intense protests on Wednesday, with the death toll climbing close to 40 according to a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists. As violent demonstrations popped up in more cities and towns across the Islamic Republic, the regime took a familiar stance, leaning into anti-Western rhetoric, ignoring the reports of dozens of civilians being killed, and offering economic aid to residents in a bid to quell the unrest that started as protests over inflation and the cost of living.",
      "As they grapple for ways to end the street protests \u2014 under the threat of U.S. intervention by President Trump \u2014 Iranian authorities said a man was executed by hanging after being convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, according to the country's state-run IRNA news agency.",
      "Ali Ardestani was convicted of providing Israeli intelligence \"with images and photos of specific locations and information on target subjects, and received amounts in the form of digital currency at the end of each mission,\" IRNA said. Iranian authorities hold trials behind closed doors, and no evidence against Ardestani was made public. Iran executed more than 1,000 people last year\u2014 the highest number of executions in the country since 1989, according to Amnesty International.",
      "The latest execution came as Iran's hardline Islamic rulers face the most significant domestic unrest seen in the country in several years. Nationwide protests against the autocratic regime entered their 12th day on Thursday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), set up by Iranian human rights activists and reliant on a network of contacts still in the country, said Wednesday that at least 38 people had been killed since the protests began, including four security forces.",
      "The protests started as business owners in Tehran vented frustration over spiraling inflation and the cost of basic goods. Iran's economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years, but the demonstrations escalated quickly into the widest protests seen in the country since 2022, following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for an alleged dress code violation.",
      "Trump's warning lingers as Iran tries to quell protests",
      "On Sunday, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. could hit Iran \"very hard\" if protesters are not protected. \"We're watching it very closely,\" Mr. Trump said. He'd said two days earlier that if Iran \"violently kills protesters,\" the U.S. would \"come to their rescue.\"",
      "So far, there's been no overt sign of the U.S. following through on these threats, even as the reported death toll from the protests climbs, and no further comment from the White House about what actions by the Iranian regime might actually trigger a response.",
      "In an effort to quell the internal pressure, Iran's government announced economic measures over the weekend to help Iranian citizens make ends meet, and state media said Wednesday that President Mahsoud Pezeshkian had ordered security forces not to attack peaceful demonstrators.",
      "Iran offers food aid in a bid to calm the streets",
      "Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said the new assistance measures, among other things, would triple national subsidies for regular households to buy basic goods, according to the state-controlled Mehr News Agency.",
      "The primary benefit, expected to begin Wednesday, would effectively triple the amount Iranians are given by the government to buy basic food items, adding the equivalent of about $7 more per month on top of existing subsidies for food, based on current exchange rates.",
      "One Iranian told CBS News on Wednesday that the subsidy increase wouldn't be enough.",

      "While NASA did not identify the astronaut in question or explain the medical issue \u2014 standard practice due to privacy concerns \u2014 the agency said \"the matter involved a single crew member who is stable.\"",

      "Going into the new year, the crew expected to remain in space until their replacements arrive in mid-February. Crew 11's return to Earth is expected around Feb. 20. That's still the official plan.",
      "In the meantime, Cardman, 38, and Fincke, 58, a veteran of nine spacewalks on earlier missions, were planning to venture outside the station Thursday to finish building a truss needed to support a set of roll-out solar arrays and to carry out other planned maintenance.",

      "\"We don't have any internal cameras right now, but we can put the lab view in if you'd like,\" the mission control communicator replied.",

      "Scammers don't wait for mistakes. They wait for exposed data. January is when profiles are refreshed, lists are rebuilt, and targets are chosen for the year ahead. The longer your personal information stays online, the more complete-and dangerous-your digital profile becomes. The good news? You can stop the cycle. Removing your data now reduces scam attempts, protects your identity, and gives you a quieter, safer year ahead. If you're going to make one privacy move this year, make it early-and make it count.",

      "Every January, the Consumer Electronics Show, better known as CES, takes over Las Vegas. It's where tech companies show off what they're building next, from products that are almost ready to buy to ideas that feel pulled from the future.",
      "CES 2026 was packed with moments that made people stop and stare. Some of the tech felt practical. Some of it felt a bit wild. However, these 10 showstoppers were the ones everyone kept talking about on the show floor.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you'll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "1) LG Wallpaper TV",
      "LG pushed TV design to the edge of invisibility once again at CES 2026. The latest Wallpaper TV, officially called the LG OLED evo W6, is just 9mm thin and sits completely flush against the wall. From the side, it looks more like glass than a television.",
      "This version feels far more practical than earlier Wallpaper models. All inputs live in a separate Zero Connect Box, which wirelessly sends visually lossless 4K video and audio to the screen from up to 30 feet away. That keeps cables out of sight and gives you more freedom when placing the TV.",
      "THIS EV HAS A FACE, AND IT TALKS BACK WITH AI",
      "The LG CLOiD robot and the LG OLED evo AI Wallpaper TV are displayed onstage during an LG Electronics news conference at CES 2026, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)",
      "Picture quality also takes a major step forward. LG's new Hyper Radiant Color Technology boosts brightness, improves color accuracy and deepens blacks while cutting screen reflections. With Brightness Booster Ultra, the Wallpaper TV reaches up to 3.9 times the brightness of conventional OLEDs and stays easy to watch even in bright rooms.",
      "Powering it all is LG's new Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen3. Its upgraded Dual AI Engine preserves natural detail while reducing noise, avoiding the overly sharp look that plagues some high-end TVs. Gamers also get plenty to like, including 4K at up to 165Hz, ultra-fast response times and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium.",
      "Availability: Expected later in 2026 through select retailers.",
      "2) Dreame Cyber X Stair-Climbing Robot Vacuum",
      "Dreame showed plenty of power at CES 2026, but the real jaw-dropper was the Cyber X concept. This robot vacuum uses a four-legged base that lets it climb stairs on its own, turning multi-level cleaning into something that finally feels automated.",
      "The design looks unusual at first, almost like a robot pet. Once it starts moving, though, the idea clicks. A built-in water tank reduces trips back to the dock, which should help extend cleaning sessions and preserve battery life.",
      "Dreame\u2019s Cyber X concept uses a four-legged design to climb stairs on its own, hinting at a new era of autonomous home robots. (Dreame)",
      "It's still a concept, but Cyber X feels like a glimpse at where home robots are headed. Less rolling around. More real autonomy.",
      "Availability: Concept product.",
      "3) SwitchBot AI MindClip",
      "SwitchBot joined the growing AI wearable trend with the MindClip, a tiny device designed to act like a second brain. It clips on easily, weighs just 18 grams and stays out of the way while quietly doing its job.",
      "MindClip can record conversations and meetings, summarize calls and create AI-powered notes. It also supports more than 100 languages, making it useful for work, travel or multilingual households. Like similar devices, it lets you listen back to recordings and read transcriptions later.",
      "Where MindClip aims to stand out is in memory. SwitchBot says users will be able to search past recordings and track down important details it captured earlier, turning everyday conversations into a searchable archive. That could be especially helpful for busy professionals and students who juggle calls, classes and meetings.",
      "The tiny MindClip clips on discreetly while recording, transcribing and organizing conversations using AI. (SwitchBot)",
      "Details are still limited, and no pricing has been announced. SwitchBot has hinted that many key features will require a subscription, which puts it in line with competing AI wearables.",
      "Availability: Not yet available. Pricing and preorder details have not been released.",
      "4) LG CLOiD Home Robot",
      "LG didn't just show off a concept robot at CES. It showed a glimpse of what a true AI-powered home might look like.",
      "At LG Electronics' booth at CES 2026, the company unveiled LG CLOiD, a home robot designed to handle real household chores as part of its \"Zero Labor Home\" vision. This isn't just a rolling assistant. CLOiD can fold laundry, help in the kitchen and move safely around furniture.",
      "The robot uses a stable, wheeled base inspired by robot vacuums, paired with a tilting torso and two articulated arms. Each arm has human-like movement and individual fingers, allowing CLOiD to grip, lift and place objects with surprising precision. In demos, it retrieved items from the fridge, loaded an oven and folded clothes after a laundry cycle.",
      "CLOiD's head acts as a mobile AI home hub, using cameras, sensors and voice-based AI to understand routines and control LG's ThinQ-connected appliances. It still feels futuristic and a little unsettling, but the technology behind it is hard to ignore. If LG can make it practical and affordable, CLOiD could mark a real step toward AI doing the housework for us.",
      "Availability: Concept and research-stage technology. Not planned for consumer sale at this time.",
      "5) Glyde Smart Hair Clippers",
      "Glyde is trying to solve one of the most frustrating parts of grooming: cutting your own hair without messing it up.",
      "The company introduced AI-powered smart hair clippers designed to guide the cut for you. You wear a simple headband that marks where a fade should start, choose a style in the app and let the clippers do the rest. Built-in sensors track your speed, angle and movement in real time, automatically adjusting the blade to keep cuts even and fades smooth.",
      "This is very much a trust exercise. You're letting software guide sharp blades near your head, and that won't be for everyone. But for people who skip the barber, hate appointments or just want a quick cleanup at home, the idea makes sense.",
      "Glyde's system is built to be \"mistake-proof.\" Move too fast, and the blade retracts. Tilt it the wrong way, and it trims less. Popular styles like buzz cuts, crew cuts and side parts are baked into the app, with step-by-step guidance that adapts as you cut.",
      "It's a one-time investment meant to replace repeat barber visits. If it works as promised, Glyde could turn haircuts into a 10-minute task you do on your own schedule.",
      "Availability: Limited early access or direct sales may come later in 2026.",
      "6) LEGO Smart Bricks",
      "LEGO is adding a digital twist to its classic bricks, and surprisingly, it works. At CES, LEGO introduced LEGO Smart Play, a new line built around \"Smart Bricks\" that look like regular LEGO pieces but hide sensors, LEDs and speakers inside. The bricks can detect movement, distance and interaction, lighting up, changing color and producing sound effects in real time as kids play.",
      "The launch leans heavily into Star Wars, including sets with Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, an X-Wing and a TIE fighter. In one demo, a Luke minifigure produced its own lightsaber sounds. In another, bricks made swooshing and crashing noises when attached to vehicles, while figures reacted when they were \"hit.\" It felt playful, immersive and instantly understandable.",
      "A LEGO piece with a smart brick attached is displayed during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)",
      "Smart Tags snap into the bricks to control different behaviors, and a quick shake wakes everything up. Pricing starts around $70 and climbs to about $160, with Star Wars sets arriving in March. LEGO hasn't shared details on battery life yet, but the goal is clear: add interactivity without pushing kids toward screens.",
      "This feels like LEGO doing tech the right way. You still build with your hands, imagine the story and snap bricks together. The technology simply brings the play to life.",
      "Availability: Launching March 2026. Expected to be sold through LEGO and major retailers.",
      "7) Autoliv Foldable Steering Wheel",
      "This might look like a small change, but it could completely reshape future car interiors.",
      "Autoliv unveiled the world's first foldable steering wheel designed for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. When the car switches into self-driving mode, the steering wheel retracts smoothly into the dashboard, opening up the cabin and giving occupants more space to relax, work or just stretch out.",
      "What makes this impressive is that safety isn't sacrificed. Autoliv built an adaptive airbag system that changes with the driving mode. When you're driving manually, the airbag lives in the steering wheel as usual. Once the wheel folds away in autonomous mode, a separate airbag in the instrument panel takes over, keeping protection intact at all times.",
      "It's a smart, practical solution to a problem automakers are already facing. If cars don't always need a steering wheel, why should it always be in the way? Autoliv's design shows how autonomy isn't just about software, it's about rethinking the entire cabin experience.",
      "Availability: Automotive supplier technology for future vehicles.",
      "8) TDM Neo Hybrid Headphones",
      "These might be the most interesting headphones at CES for one simple reason: they refuse to stay just headphones.",
      "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter, better known as TDM, unveiled Neo, a premium on-ear 2-in-1 hybrid headphone that physically twists into a compact Bluetooth speaker. No docking. No accessories. Just a quick rotation, and your personal audio turns into shared sound. Amazing, right?",
      "The concept might sound a bit gimmicky, but the execution feels solid. The hinge mechanism is sturdy, the transformation is intuitive, and the idea makes a lot of sense in real life. You can listen privately on a train, then flip Neo into speaker mode the moment you meet up with friends.",
      "TDM describes this as going from \"solo to social,\" and that's exactly the appeal. It blurs the line between headphones and portable speakers in a way we haven't really seen before. For travelers, outdoor users, or anyone who hates carrying multiple audio devices, Neo could be a genuinely very useful hybrid device.",
      "Availability: TDM will be launching Neo on Kickstarter later this month and will begin shipping in July.",
      "9) Jackery Solar Mars Bot",
      "Jackery made waves at CES with the Solar Mars Bot, a mobile solar generator that can move, track sunlight and recharge itself without constant setup.",
      "The Solar Mars Bot uses AI-enhanced computer vision to navigate on its own, follow its user and reposition throughout the day to capture the strongest available sunlight. Instead of manually adjusting panels or relocating gear, the system handles those decisions automatically. When not in use, its solar panels fold and retract, which helps make storage and transport more practical.",
      "What sets this system apart is how it blends mobility with energy storage. Unlike fixed solar installations that stay in one place or portable generators that must be carried and recharged by hand, the Solar Mars Bot actively manages its own power intake. It tracks the sun, recharges itself using solar energy and delivers power where it is needed.",
      "That makes it especially useful for extended power outages, off-grid living, emergency backup and outdoor adventures where access to electricity can change throughout the day. The Solar Mars Bot shows how portable power can become more intelligent, adaptable and hands-off when conditions are unpredictable.",
      "Availability: Prototype showcased at CES.",
      "10) Timeli Personal Safety Device",
      "Timeli grabbed a lot of attention at CES 2026 with a simple, immediate approach to personal safety. By combining a flashlight, HD video recording, a loud alarm, GPS tracking and live emergency dispatch into one handheld device, it earned a CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree and plenty of interest on the show floor.",
      "Instead of opening an app or tapping through menus, Timeli relies on muscle memory. A quick press turns on a powerful flashlight and starts recording video. If a situation escalates, pressing and holding the SOS button triggers a full safety sequence. The alarm sounds, live video begins streaming, GPS coordinates lock in and two-way communication connects directly to emergency dispatch over cellular service.",
      "That live connection matters. Timeli works with RapidSOS to give dispatchers real-time video and location data. This added clarity helps responders understand what is happening faster and send the right help sooner. Studies show video verified emergencies can cut response times dramatically, while also reducing false alarms.",
      "Timeli works even without a phone. Built-in cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow it to operate on its own or alongside the companion app for iOS and Android. Users can adjust video quality, light brightness and alarm volume to match their needs. Cloud video storage and alerts add another layer of reassurance.",
      "WORLD'S THINNEST AI GLASSES FEATURE BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT",
      "The design stays practical. Timeli is about the size and weight of a smartphone, so it fits easily in a pocket, purse or backpack. Battery life supports long standby time, extended daily use and several hours of active protection. It even doubles as a power bank, while reserving enough charge to stay ready for emergencies.",
      "Availability:\u00a0Priced at $249 for preorder through timeli.com. Timeli includes a year of professional monitoring before transitioning to a monthly subscription.",
      "Honorable mentions: CES 2026 products worth checking out",
      "These products also stood out on the CES 2026 show floor, highlighting smart design choices and meaningful innovation that point to the future of consumer tech.",
      "ASUS reimagined portable productivity with the 2026 Zenbook Duo. This laptop snaps two 14-inch 3K ASUS Lumina OLED touchscreens together into a single mobile workstation you can carry with one hand.",
      "The dual-screen setup lets you keep a main project open on one display while chats, calls or reference material live on the other. That alone cuts down on constant app switching. The OLED panels deliver rich color, deep blacks, smooth motion and built-in eye care that makes long sessions easier on your eyes.",
      "ASUS also upgraded what you hear. A new six-speaker system replaces the previous two-speaker design, creating fuller, more immersive audio for movies, music, and calls. Everything is wrapped in a Ceraluminum ceramic finish that resists fingerprints and scratches while feeling premium in hand.",
      "Availability: Expected early 2026. Pricing has not been announced.",
      "SpotOn focused on precision and reliability with the launch of the SpotOn GPS Fence Nova Edition. This is a GPS dog fence system designed to create virtual fences anywhere, from small yards to massive rural properties, with no subscription required.",
      "What sets Nova apart is its advanced antenna and receiver system. SpotOn uses a dual-band, dual-feed active antenna paired with a dual-band receiver that reduces GPS drift by up to 40% and delivers accuracy up to eight times better than competing systems. In third-party testing, it achieved 100% reliable containment.",
      "Owners can create unlimited fences by walking boundaries, drawing them in the app, or placing GPS fenceposts automatically. The collar also includes intelligent audio cues, optional static correction, custom voice commands, LED prompts and sizing that grows with your dog. If a dog ever leaves the fence, tracking tools are available through the app or SpotOn support.",
      "Availability: Available in the US and Canada for $999.",
      "Lenovo took handheld gaming seriously with the Legion Go powered by SteamOS. This is the most powerful Legion handheld to ship natively with SteamOS, blending desktop-class performance with console-like simplicity.",
      "It features an 8.8-inch PureSight OLED display and can be configured with up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and up to 2TB of PCIe SSD storage with expansion via microSD. SteamOS is tuned for gamepad controls and quick access, with features like fast suspend and resume, cloud saves, Steam Chat and built-in game recording.",
      "The result feels less like a mini PC and more like a true console you can carry. You get instant access to your Steam library without juggling operating systems or launchers.",
      "Availability: On sale June 2026. Starting price is $1,199.",
      "SanDisk introduced a new internal drive brand at CES, and the Optimus GX 7100M is its first standout. Built for handheld gaming consoles and thin and light laptops, this PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD delivers speeds up to 7,250 MB per second.",
      "The drive is available in capacities up to 2TB, giving gamers faster load times, more room for large libraries and smoother performance on the go. It is designed for devices that support an M.2 2230 slot, including popular handheld consoles and compact laptops.",
      "This launch also marks the debut of the SanDisk Optimus name, which will replace the company's internal SSD lineup for gamers, creators and professionals moving forward.",
      "Availability: Expected early spring 2026. Pricing will be announced closer to release.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CES 2026 made one thing clear. Tech companies are taking bigger swings than ever. Some of these products feel close to becoming part of everyday life. Others may stay experimental for years. That's what makes CES so fascinating. It gives us an early look at where technology could be headed and sparks conversations about what we actually want in our homes, cars and daily routines.",

      "From AI-driven health insights to tools designed to reduce everyday risk, these are the health tech products people are stopping to look at on the CES 2026 show floor.",
      "NuraLogix introduced a smart mirror that turns a short selfie video into a snapshot of your long-term health outlook. The Longevity Mirror analyzes subtle blood flow patterns in your face using AI and scores metabolic health, heart health and physiological age from zero to 100.",
      "Results appear in about 30 seconds along with clear explanations and recommendations. The AI was trained on hundreds of thousands of patient records, which helps translate raw data into understandable insights.",
      "The mirror supports up to six user profiles. It launches in early 2026 for $899 and includes a one-year subscription. After this, the subscription costs $99 per year. Optional concierge support connects users with nutrition and wellness experts.",
      "Ascentiz showed how mobility tech is shifting toward real-world use at CES 2026. The Ascentiz H1 Pro walking exoskeleton stood out for its lightweight, modular design, which reduces strain while supporting motor-assisted movement across longer distances.",
      "The system uses AI to adapt assistance to the user's motion and terrain, making it useful on inclines and uneven ground. A belt-based attachment system keeps the device compact and easy to wear, while dust- and water-resistant construction supports outdoor use in different conditions.",
      "For users who need more power, Ascentiz also offers Ultra and knee or hip-attached models that deliver stronger assistance. Together, the lineup shows how exoskeletons are moving beyond clinical rehab and toward everyday mobility support.",
      "Cosmo Robotics earned a CES Innovation Award for Bambini Kids, the first overground pediatric exoskeleton with powered ankle motion. It is designed for children ages 2.5 to 7 with congenital or acquired neurological disorders.",

      "Cybercriminals have found a clever new way to get phishing emails straight into inboxes.",
      "Instead of spoofing brands, they are abusing real cloud tools that people already trust. Security researchers say attackers recently hijacked a legitimate email feature inside Google Cloud.",
      "The result was thousands of phishing messages that looked and felt like normal Google notifications. Many slipped past spam filters with ease.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How this Google Cloud phishing attack worked",
      "At the center of the campaign was Google Cloud Application Integration. This service allows businesses to send automated email notifications from workflows they build. Attackers exploited the Send Email task inside that system. Because the messages came from a real Google address, they appeared authentic to both users and security tools.",
      "According to Check Point, a global cybersecurity firm that tracks and analyzes large-scale threat campaigns, the emails were sent from a legitimate Google-owned address and closely matched Google's notification style. Fonts, wording, and layout all looked familiar. Over a two-week period in December 2025, attackers sent more than 9,000 phishing emails targeting roughly 3,200 organizations across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.",
      "Attackers used trusted Google Cloud infrastructure to route victims through multiple redirects before revealing the scam. (Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Why Google phishing emails were so convincing",
      "The messages looked like routine workplace alerts. Some claimed you had received a voicemail. Others said you were granted access to a shared document, like a Q4 file. That sense of normalcy lowered suspicion. Many people are used to seeing these exact messages every day. Even more concerning, the emails bypassed common protections like SPF and DMARC because they were sent through Google-owned infrastructure. To email systems, nothing looked fake.",
      "What happens after you click",
      "The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a fake Microsoft login page hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.",
      "Who was targeted in the Google Cloud phishing attack",
      "Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.",
      "\"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration,\" a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. \"Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google\u2019s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.\"",
      "The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.",
      "Ways to stay safe from trusted-looking phishing emails",
      "Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.",
      "Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.",
      "Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.",
      "The final step led users to a fake Microsoft login page, where entered credentials were silently stolen. (Stack Social)",
      "Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. Many now detect malicious links, fake CAPTCHA pages, and credential harvesting sites in real time. Strong antivirus software can block phishing pages even after a click, which matters in multi-stage attacks like this one.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing campaigns often succeed because attackers already know your email, employer or role. That information is commonly pulled from data broker sites. A data removal service helps remove your personal information from these databases, making it harder for attackers to craft convincing, targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Google phishing emails looked like routine workplace alerts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This campaign highlights a growing shift in phishing tactics. Attackers no longer need to fake brands when they can abuse trusted cloud services directly. As automation becomes more common, security awareness matters more than ever. Even familiar emails deserve a second look, especially when they push urgency or ask for credentials.",

    "summary": "Researchers create supercapacitors from waste PET plastic bottles that could power electric vehicles and electronics within 5 to 10 years.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new scientific breakthrough suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.",
      "Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage devices called supercapacitors. The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles.",
      "The research was published in Energy & Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.",

      "SCIENTISTS EXTRACT SILVER FROM E-WASTE USING COOKING OIL",
      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",
      "NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS",
      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",

      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",
      "Real browser and operating system updates come from built-in update tools, not pop-ups on websites. If an update is needed, your device will notify you directly through system settings or trusted app stores.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine. Nothing about the moment screams danger. But behind the scenes, one click can quietly hand over passwords, banking access and personal data. The good news is that slowing down makes a real difference. Closing a suspicious page and trusting built-in system updates can stop these attacks cold.

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss grocery stores collecting biometric data, including facial recognition and eye scans, as Wegmans confirms limited use in higher-risk locations.",
      "Browser extensions promise convenience. Many offer simple tools like new tab pages, translators or video helpers.",
      "Researchers, however, uncovered a long-running malware operation that abused that trust on a massive scale. Koi Security analysts identified the threat while analyzing suspicious infrastructure tied to a campaign known as ShadyPanda. What started as one investigation quickly revealed something far larger.",
      "The group behind it is now known as DarkSpectre. According to Koi researchers, it infected more than 8.8 million users across Chrome, Edge and Firefox over seven years. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It was slow, deliberate and highly organized. Instead of rushing malicious code into marketplaces, the group played the long game.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Security researchers say millions of users unknowingly installed browser extensions that later turned malicious after years of appearing legitimate. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "One threat actor behind three major campaigns",
      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked. In several cases, extensions remained legitimate for more than five years before quietly turning malicious.",
      "This campaign used a clever trick. It hid malicious code inside image files to bypass security checks. It impacted 1.05 million users.",
      "This operation targeted corporate meeting data across more than 28 conferencing platforms. It affected 2.2 million users.",
      "Different goals. Same operator.",
      "How Koi uncovered DarkSpectre's hidden network",
      "The breakthrough came when Koi analysts examined two domains tied to ShadyPanda. Those domains powered legitimate extension features like weather widgets and new tab pages. They were not command servers. That was the trick. Those same clean domains appeared again and again across other extensions that quietly connected to entirely different malicious infrastructure.",
      "One domain led to extensions. Those extensions exposed new domains. Those domains were connected to even more extensions. Following that chain allowed Koi to uncover over 100 connected extensions across multiple browser marketplaces. Some extensions even reused infrastructure already flagged in earlier investigations. That overlap confirmed DarkSpectre was operating at a nation-state scale.",
      "How DarkSpectre stayed hidden for years",
      "DarkSpectre succeeded by blending legitimate functionality with hidden malware. Users got what they expected. Meanwhile, the threat ran quietly in the background.",
      "Some extensions waited days before activating malicious behavior. Others triggered malware on only a small percentage of page loads. This made detection during marketplace reviews extremely difficult.",
      "The group hid JavaScript inside PNG image files. The extension loaded its own logo, extracted the hidden code and executed it silently.",
      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",

      "A long-running malware operation quietly abused trusted browser extensions across Chrome, Edge and Firefox, infecting millions worldwide. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. A data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.",
      "It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Analysts uncovered a coordinated campaign that hid spyware inside everyday browser tools like new tab pages and translators. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Subtle changes often appear before obvious damage. Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",
      "When in doubt, trust your instincts. Browsers should not surprise you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "DarkSpectre is a reminder that online threats are getting smarter and quieter. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It unfolded slowly, over years, and relied on trust most people never think twice about. Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today. Browser extensions can be helpful, but every extra add-on is another door into your browser. Paying attention, cleaning house now and then, and questioning what you install can make a real difference.",

      "Chrome extensions are supposed to make your browser more useful, but they've quietly become one of the easiest ways for attackers to spy on what you do online. Security researchers recently uncovered two Chrome extensions that have been doing exactly that for years.",
      "These extensions looked like harmless proxy tools, but behind the scenes, they were hijacking traffic and stealing sensitive data from users who trusted them. What makes this case worse is where these extensions were found. Both were listed on Chrome's official extension marketplace.",

      "Security researchers uncovered malicious Chrome extensions that quietly routed users\u2019 web traffic through attacker-controlled servers to steal sensitive data. (Gokhan Balci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",
      "Malicious Chrome extensions hiding in plain sight",
      "Researchers at Socket discovered two Chrome extensions using the same name, \"Phantom Shuttle,\" that were posing as tools for proxy routing and network speed testing (via Bleeping Computer). According to the researchers, the extensions have been active since at least 2017.",
      "Both extensions were published under the same developer name and marketed toward foreign trade workers who need to test internet connectivity from different regions. They were sold as subscription-based tools, with prices ranging from roughly $1.40 to $13.60.",
      "At a glance, everything looked normal. The descriptions matched the functionality. The pricing seemed reasonable. The problem was what the extensions were doing after installation.",
      "How Phantom Shuttle steals your data",
      "Socket researchers say Phantom Shuttle routes all your web traffic through proxy servers controlled by the attacker. Those proxies use hardcoded credentials embedded directly into the extension's code. To avoid detection, the malicious logic is hidden inside what appears to be a legitimate jQuery library.",
      "The attackers didn't just leave credentials sitting in plain text. The extensions hide them using a custom character-index encoding scheme. Once active, the extension listens to web traffic and intercepts HTTP authentication challenges on any site you visit.",
      "To make sure traffic always flows through their infrastructure, the extensions dynamically reconfigure Chrome's proxy settings using an auto-configuration script. This forces your browser to route requests exactly where the attacker wants them.",
      "In its default \"smarty\" mode, Phantom Shuttle routes traffic from more than 170 high-value domains through its proxy network. That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",
      "While acting as a man-in-the-middle, the extension can capture anything you submit through web forms. That includes usernames, passwords, card details, personal information, session cookies from HTTP headers and API tokens pulled directly from network requests.",

      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",

      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",

      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.",

      "Avoid treating AI chatbots as a replacement for professional mental health care or trusted human support.Take breaks if conversations begin to feel emotionally overwhelming or all-consuming.Be cautious if an AI response strongly reinforces beliefs that feel unrealistic or extreme.Limit late-night or sleep-deprived interactions, which can worsen emotional instability.Encourage open conversations with family members or caregivers if chatbot use becomes frequent or isolating.",

      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Most robot headlines follow a familiar script: a machine masters one narrow trick in a controlled lab, then comes the bold promise that everything is about to change. I usually tune those stories out. We have heard about robots taking over since science fiction began, yet real-life robots still struggle with basic flexibility. This time felt different.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",
      "More broadly, it signals a shift in artificial intelligence. We are moving away from flashy tricks and toward systems that learn in more human-like ways. Not smarter than people. Just closer to how we actually operate day to day.",

When machines start learning more like humans, the conversation changes. The question shifts from what robots can repeat to what they can adapt to next. That shift is worth paying attention to.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump and his allies have for weeks intensified scrutiny on Minnesota and its governor, Democrat Tim Walz.",
    "story": [
      "Two days before Christmas, with federal agents ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stepped to a microphone and issued a warning.",
      "\u201cI am increasingly concerned because of the chaos that is being caused by these ICE agents,\u201d Frey said. \u201cSomebody is going to get seriously injured or killed.\u201d",
      "Two weeks later, with some 2,000 federal agents \u2014 more than three times the number of police officers employed by the Minneapolis Police Department \u2014 deployed to the state, that very thing happened. A federal immigration officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, on Wednesday, unleashing a national furor, pitting federal and local officials against each other and drawing thousands of people to the streets in protest.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s deadly confrontation was the culmination of weeks of intensified scrutiny, verbal attacks and even conspiracy theories directed at Minnesota and Gov. Tim Walz by President Donald Trump, his administration and his allies.",
      "Exactly why the president has been so fixated on Minnesota isn\u2019t totally clear, though local officials and strategists working in state and national politics have pointed NBC News to Trump\u2019s long-running \u2014 and unsuccessful \u2014 attempts to win the state and his personal disdain for Walz. (Trump, however, has repeatedly falsely claimed that he did win the state.) Many said it\u2019s a case of Trump going after deep-blue cities in part due to their immigration policies.",
      "A central focus of the administration\u2019s attacks on Minnesota has also been the Justice Department\u2019s yearslong fraud investigation that has involved some members of Minnesota\u2019s Somali community.",
      "In 2022, during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, federal prosecutors announced initial indictments in what they called a $250 million scheme to defraud a federal child nutrition program. They described Aimee Bock, who is white, as the mastermind of the operation. A jury convicted her in March. So far, prosecutors have charged 92 people and dozens have been convicted.",
      "But conservative influencers have latched onto the scandal to push unsubstantiated claims, and Trump has used it to make disparaging remarks about people of Somali descent.",
      "For Minnesotans, the result of all this attention has largely been disgust, fury and exhaustion.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to break us,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Emma Greenman, whose district is roughly a mile from where the shooting occurred. She said she believes the administration targeted the state because it is \u201ca successful story of multiracial democracy and immigration \u2014 and it inherently represents a threat to authoritarian power.\u201d",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Trump \u201cloves Minnesota and the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a state where he received historic Republican support, and he has long called out Walz for his incompetence and terrible leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wish they would just leave us the f--- alone,\u201d Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Asked why Trump was so fixated on the state, Smith replied, \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d",
      "'He's never gotten Walz'",
      "Trump has called Walz \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cwhacked out\u201d and \u201cgrossly incompetent.\u201d On Saturday, the president shared a video on social media that promoted a conspiracy theory about a Democratic lawmaker in the state who, along with her husband, was assassinated in June. The video falsely implied that Walz had something to do with the killing.",
      "Trump has also repeatedly made derogatory comments in recent weeks about Somali immigrants in Minnesota, calling them \u201cscammers\u201d and \u201clowlifes.\u201d While the fraud investigation into the use of federal social services funds in Minnesota has received bipartisan support in the past, Somali Americans who run child care facilities, which have been the subject of fresh allegations in the scandal, in the state say they\u2019ve been harassed and threatened since a conservative influencer\u2019s lengthy video on the issue went viral.",
      "Many Democrats in the state have acknowledged that its party leaders have mishandled the situation politically as well. A state audit report released in 2024 found that failures by the state\u2019s Education Department led to the misuse of the Covid-era program.",
      "On Monday, Walz made the surprise announcement that he would no longer be running for re-election amid the scrutiny and pressure.",
      "A former senior White House official who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Trump has long been mystified by why then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in 2024.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s never gotten Walz. Never gotten it,\u201d the official said, saying Trump and his team believed someone like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would have been a stronger choice.",
      "For some in Minnesota, what made Good\u2019s shooting especially tragic was that they saw something like it coming. Bringing in federal agents, against the wishes of the state\u2019s political leaders \u2014 and many of its residents \u2014 was a bomb waiting to go off, Frey and Walz said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It\u2019s governing by reality TV, and today that recklessness cost someone their life,\u201d Walz said in a news conference. \u201cNow we hear more political rhetoric. Enough. Enough is enough.\u201d",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Frey called the incident \u201ctotally predictable\u201d and \u201ctotally avoidable\u201d and told Immigration and Customs Enforcement to \u201cget the f--- out\u201d of Minneapolis.",
      "On Fox News on Wednesday night, Vice President JD Vance declared that Walz should resign. He also made an admission.",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve beaten up on Tim Walz enough. I don\u2019t want to do it anymore on your program,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI almost feel bad for the guy, except for the fact that he should have seen this,\u201d he said, referring to the fraud allegations.",
      "On Thursday, however, Vance joined Leavitt at the press briefing, where he again went after Walz.",
      "\u201cTim Walz is a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cHis entire administration has been a joke, the idea that he\u2019s some sort of freedom fighter. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s a guy who has enabled fraud, and maybe, in fact, has participated in fraud.\u201d There is no evidence that Walz participated in alleged fraud.",
      "Leavitt also said the administration wouldn\u2019t be taking its eye off Minnesota.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security will continue to operate on the ground in Minnesota, not only to remove criminal illegal aliens, but also to continue conducting door-to-door investigations of the rampant fraud that has taken place in the state under the failed and corrupt leadership of Democrat Gov. Tim Walz,\u201d she announced.",
      "Tensions, years in the making",
      "Trump\u2019s focus on Minnesota can be traced to 2016, when he first toppled the so-called blue wall and won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 and saw Minnesota as potentially within reach. Republicans have not won Minnesota in a presidential election since 1972.",
      "In the view of one Democratic strategist who has worked in Minnesota, \u201cthe Trump folks thought if they squeezed Minnesota, they could turn it red.\u201d Preya Samsundar, a Minnesota-based Republican strategist, noted Trump\u2019s long-held goal of turning the state red and described the president\u2019s attention and effort as a \u201cpoke in the eye\u201d to Walz.",
      "\u201cI think for a lot of folks, Minnesota is still one of those states that can be attainable with the right effort,\u201d said Samsundar, a former Midwest regional communications director for the Republican National Committee. \u201cI think now a part of the White House\u2019s focus is because Tim Walz was a VP candidate from a state that Trump has wanted to flip for some while.\u201d",
      "Until abandoning his campaign for a third term, Walz had been positioning himself as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s future leaders, \u201cmaking him a convenient person to go after,\u201d Samsundar added.",
      "Indeed, Trump\u2019s criticism of Walz intensified after Harris chose him as her running mate. Trump frequently assailed Walz as a \u201cdangerously liberal extremist.\u201d Walz, for his part, emerged as the Democratic ticket\u2019s chief attack dog against Trump, further attracting his ire.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "After Trump won, he and his allies lumped Minnesota in with other Democratic states that, he said, weren\u2019t aggressive enough on immigration.",
      "Minnesota is home to the nation\u2019s largest Somali population, and most of them are U.S. citizens. Since 1993, thousands of people have fled war and instability in the East African country.",
      "As Trump has ramped up ICE actions across the U.S., the community, mostly based in the Twin Cities, has been the target of the agency\u2019s efforts in Minnesota. And Walz hasn\u2019t held his tongue regarding ICE, slamming it last year as Trump\u2019s \u201cmodern-day Gestapo.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a longtime Walz ally, called the governor to remind him to keep in mind what he was dealing with: a Trump administration that lies, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.",
      "Pritzker also reupped a playbook he had shared in the past with Walz and other Democratic governors, which was to repeatedly remind his state\u2019s residents that it was their right to protest the government but not to \u201ctake the bait\u201d and descend into violence. That was, Pritzker believed, exactly what the Trump administration wanted so it could declare martial law.",
      "Later Wednesday, Walz conveyed that to his residents, imploring them not to \u201ctake the bait.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want a show,\u201d Walz said at his news conference. \u201cWe can\u2019t give it to them.\u201d",
      "Unfolding fraud allegations",
      "Meanwhile, a broad fraud scandal has been unfolding in the state involving the alleged misuse of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal welfare funds. The allegations pertain largely to the Somali community. Trump has repeatedly said the Somali community has \u201cdestroyed Minnesota\u201c and \u201cour country,\u201d and his Justice Department is sending additional federal prosecutors to the state to assist the U.S. attorney\u2019s office there with the ongoing investigations into the matter.",
      "Republicans in the state and at the national level have blamed Walz for not taking the allegations seriously.",
      "\u201cThe fraud is a powerful issue because it\u2019s a real-life example of what the majority of Republicans and independents already feel is true \u2014 that their tax dollars are wasted by politicians and people taking advantage of the system,\u201d said Matt Wolking, a longtime GOP strategist who was on Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign.",
      "A state Democratic lawmaker, however, said the Republican attacks all feel \u201cvery personal.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has vendettas \u2014 he goes after people. Clearly that\u2019s a piece of this,\u201d the person said.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cThe city is emotionally fatigued,\u201d added Roy Temple, a national Democratic operative with decades of experience in Minnesota politics, who said that, even six years later, the city is \u201cstill healing\u201d from the George Floyd murder and fallout.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s nerves are pretty shot,\u201d Temple said, adding that the ICE raids and the fatal shooting are \u201ctriggering.\u201d",
      "Complicating part of the picture, however, is the scope and potential severity of the allegations of fraud.",
      "Other Democrats in the state agreed with the sentiment that Trump was unfairly attacking many elements of Walz\u2019s record and dumping on the Somali community \u2014 while also acknowledging the possibility that Walz hasn\u2019t handled the situation well.",
      "\u201cThis has been in the air in Minnesota for some time; it\u2019s one of those things that we knew at some point this issue would really kind of percolate to the top. And we\u2019re seeing that happen now, where a spotlight is put on this \u2014 for multiple reasons,\u201d a Minneapolis-based Democratic operative said. The operative added that Walz\u2019s \u201cbiggest problem\u201d with the fraud allegations was that \u201che just didn\u2019t really have any good answers for any of this.\u201d",
      "At a separate hearing in Congress this week on the Minnesota fraud issue, Democrats fumed about the hypocrisy of Trump administration officials who, while complaining about fraud and ICE protests in Democratic areas, pardoned fraudsters aligned with the president as well as those convicted of violence against federal officers on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Republicans in the state largely defended Trump\u2019s message \u2014 though not necessarily his tone \u2014 expressing solidarity with efforts to unroot fraud and tackle immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cThe national attention that the president has brought to Minnesota means that people are listening now,\u201d state GOP Chair Alex Plechash said."

      "For those in this city known for its surfing and beach life, the sights and roars of fighter jets and Reaper drones were a reminder that, just a few miles away, the air facilities of a once-shuttered U.S. military base have gained renewed importance in President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to assert \u201cAmerican dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d",
      "While Puerto Rico has long been considered a crucial U.S. military asset because of its location, much of the robust military infrastructure and training facilities established on the island shuttered after the end of the Cold War because of cuts in military spending and local opposition over the environmental and health effects of the artillery and hardware used in target practices for decades.",

      "For years, people could largely trust, at least instinctively, that seeing was believing. Now, what\u2019s fake often looks real and what\u2019s real often looks fake.",
      "Within the first week of 2026, that has already become a conundrum many media experts say will be hard to move past, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Venezuela operation almost immediately spurred the spread of AI-generated images, old videos and altered photos across social media. On Wednesday, after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a woman in her car, many online circulated a fake, most likely AI-edited image of the scene that appears to be based on real video. Others used AI in attempts to digitally remove the mask of the ICE officer who shot her.",
      "The confusion around AI content comes as many social media platforms, which pay creators for engagement, have given users incentives to recycle old photos and videos to ramp up emotion around viral news moments. The amalgam of misinformation, experts say, is creating a heightened erosion of trust online \u2014 especially when it mixes with authentic evidence.",
      "\u201cAs we start to worry about AI, it will likely, at least in the short term, undermine our trust default \u2014 that is, that we believe communication until we have some reason to disbelieve,\u201d said Jeff Hancock, founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the big challenge, is that for a while people are really going to not trust things they see in digital spaces.\u201d",
      "Though AI is the latest technology to spark concern about surging misinformation, similar trust breakdowns have cycled through history, from election misinformation in 2016 to the mass production of propaganda after the printing press was invented in the 1400s. Before AI, there was Photoshop, and before Photoshop, there were analog image manipulation techniques.",
      "Fast-moving news events are where manipulated media have the biggest effect, because they fill in for the broad lack of information, Hancock said.",
      "On Saturday, Trump shared a photo on his verified Truth Social account of the deposed Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed aboard a Navy assault ship. Shortly afterward, unverified images surrounding the capture \u2014 some of which were then turned into AI-generated videos \u2014 began to flood other social media platforms.",
      "As real celebrations unfolded, X owner Elon Musk was among those sharing what appeared to be an AI-generated video of Venezuelans thanking the U.S. for capturing Maduro.",
      "AI-generated evidence has already made its way into courtrooms. AI deepfakes have also fooled officials \u2014 late last year, a flood of AI-generated videos online portrayed Ukrainian soldiers apologizing to the Russian people and surrendering to Russian forces en masse.",
      "Hancock said that even as much of the misinformation online still comes through more traditional avenues, such as people misappropriating real media to paint false narratives, AI is rapidly dumping more fuel on the fire.",
      "\u201cIn terms of just looking at an image or a video, it will essentially become impossible to detect if it\u2019s fake. I think that we\u2019re getting close to that point, if we\u2019re not already there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old sort of AI literacy ideas of \u2018let\u2019s just look at the number of fingers\u2019 and things like that are likely to go away.\u201d",
      "Renee Hobbs, a professor of communication studies at the University of Rhode Island, said the main struggle for researchers who study AI is that people face cognitive exhaustion as they try to navigate the sheer volume of real and synthetic content online. That makes it harder for them to sift through what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.",
      "The old sort of AI literacy ideas of \u2018let\u2019s just look at the number of fingers\u2019 and things like that are likely to go away",
      "Jeff Hancock, founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab",
      "\u201cIf constant doubt and anxiety about what to trust is the norm, then actually, disengagement is a logical response. It\u2019s a coping mechanism,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cAnd then when people stop caring about whether something\u2019s true or not, then the danger is not just deception, but actually it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s the whole collapse of even being motivated to seek truth.\u201d",
      "She and other experts are working to figure out how to incorporate generative AI into media literacy education. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an intergovernmental body of democratic countries that collaborate to develop policy standards, is scheduled to release a global Media & Artificial Intelligence Literacy assessment for 15-year-olds in 2029, for example.",
      "Even some social media giants that have embraced generative AI appear wary of its infiltration into people\u2019s algorithms.",
      "In a recent post on Threads, the head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, touched on his concerns surrounding AI misinformation\u2019s becoming more common across platforms.",
      "\u201cFor most of my life I could safely assume that the vast majority of photographs or videos that I see are largely accurate captures of moments that happened in real life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is clearly no longer the case and it\u2019s going to take us, as people, years to adapt.\u201d",
      "Mosseri predicted that internet users will \u201cmove from assuming what we see is real by default, to starting with skepticism when we see media, and paying much more attention to who is sharing something and why they might be sharing it. This is going to be incredibly uncomfortable for all of us because we\u2019re genetically predisposed to believing our eyes.\u201d",
      "Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at the UC Berkeley School of Information, said his recent research on deepfake detection has found that people are just as likely to say something real is fake as they are to say something fake is real. The accuracy rate worsens significantly when people are shown content with political undertones \u2014 because then confirmation bias kicks in.",
      "\u201cWhen I send you something that conforms to your worldview, you want to believe it. You\u2019re incentivized to believe it,\u201d Farid said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s something that contradicts your worldview, you\u2019re highly incentivized to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s fake.\u2019 And so when you add that partisanship onto it, it blows everything out of the water.\u201d",
      "People are also likelier to immediately trust those they\u2019re familiar with \u2014 such as celebrities, politicians, family members and friends \u2014 so AI likenesses of such figures will be even likelier to dupe people as they get more realistic, said Siwei Lyu, a professor of computer science at the University at Buffalo.",
      "Lyu, who helps maintain an open-source AI detection platform called DeepFake-o-meter, said everyday internet users can boost their AI detection skills simply by paying attention. Even if they don\u2019t have the ability to analyze every bit of media they come across, he said, people should at least ask themselves why they trust or distrust what they see.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, it may not be the media itself that has anything wrong, but it\u2019s put up in the wrong context or by somebody we cannot totally trust,\u201d Lyu said. \u201cSo I think, all in all, common awareness and common sense are the most important protection measures we have, and they do not need special training.\u201d"

      "As she and her husband prepared to welcome their first child, Green Smith set up a pink and rose gold nursery in their Spartanburg, South Carolina, home. She labeled each dresser drawer for the tiny clothes her daughter would soon wear. She shared ultrasound images with relatives, growing more excited as her February due date drew closer.",
      "But Green Smith, 31, was also nervous, according to her sister. She had devoted much of her career to improving health outcomes for women in her position: Black mothers-to-be, who face disproportionate risks.",
      "\u201cBlack women are three times more likely to die in pregnancy and in childbirth than any other race. In hearing these alarming statistics, I wanted to do something about it,\u201d Green Smith said in a 2024 Instagram post explaining why she became a certified nurse-midwife. \u201cI wanted to be a part of the solution.\u201d",
      "Friends and colleagues say she achieved her goal, fiercely advocating for safer, more respectful Black maternal health care in her community and beyond. That made it all the more heartbreaking when Green Smith died on New Year\u2019s Day \u2014 less than a week after giving birth to her daughter.",
      "\u201cHer worst fear has come to pass,\u201d her older sister, Selina Green, told NBC News.",
      "Green Smith had developed pre-eclampsia while pregnant, a condition characterized by high blood pressure that can be fatal. Because of the risks, doctors often recommend early delivery. On Dec. 26, eight weeks ahead of her due date, Green Smith gave birth via cesarean section at Prisma Health Greenville Memorial Hospital, according to Nichole Wardlaw, her husband\u2019s aunt, who is acting as a spokesperson for the family as they grieve.",
      "The baby girl, named Eden, is currently in the neonatal intensive care unit.",
      "Green Smith initially seemed to recover from the C-section. But in the days afterward, her incision site ruptured, Wardlaw said. Doctors tried repairing it at her bedside but later rushed her into emergency surgery. As the operation ended, there were complications, Wardlaw said. Green Smith went into cardiac arrest and died days later. (NBC News has not reviewed Green Smith\u2019s medical records.)"

She's very carefree and takes up all the space that she wants to, which I think is an exciting new interpretation.",

      "Based on Emily Henry's 2021 novel of the same name, \"People We Meet on Vacation\" is a friends-to-lovers romance between two polar opposites, Poppy (Bader) and Alex (Blyth), who meet in college and maintain a friendship through annual summer trips.",
      "One of those trips took them to New Orleans, during which Alex and Poppy pretend to be married to enjoy some complimentary items. To uphold the ruse, they lean into their alter married egos and perform a \u201cfairly elaborate dance scene\" \u2014 as Craig describes it \u2014 set to Paula Abdul's \"Forever Your Girl.\"",

      "\"I fancied this girl and this other guy came into the school and did the worm and did a bunch of break dance moves, and he got the girl,\" Blyth recalls.",
      "\"So I went home, and I practiced, and now it's the only takeaway from that experience, was the worm,\" he added.",
      "Craig then asked for Blyth to demonstrate what makes a \"good worm.\"",

      "Craig then took off his suit jacket, raring to go.",
      "\"They warned me about this,\" Blyth said with a laugh. \"Am I going to do the worm on a morning show?\"",
      "Seconds later, Blyth executed a flawless \"light\" version of the worm, to cheers and applause from Bader.",
      "Craig then had to uphold his end of the bargain. He got onto the floor almost in a push-up position and gave his best attempt at rolling his body down in the classic worm motion.",
      "\"That was pretty good!\" Blyth praised.",
      "Carson Daly, however, had a different take. Carson had to watch it all unfold from Studio 1A, covering his eyes at one point.",
      "\"I apologize, Carson,\" Craig said.",

      "The Emmy-winning Peacock competition series is back with the same murderous game mechanics and a new twist that will keep even the viewers second guessing who they can trust. The first four episodes of Season 4 arrived on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 8 with a supersized premiere that quickly introduced fans to the 23 cast members \u2014 featuring multiple \u201cReal Housewives\u201d alums, Olympians, Survivor winners and more celebrities \u2014 who learned if they have to play the game as a Faithful or a Traitor.",
      "But before they stepped foot into the castle, Cumming announced a new element: he would select a \u201cSecret Traitor\u201d in plain sight in front of everyone. That player\u2019s identity would remain hidden from everyone, including the audience, until later on in the game. He later selected his group of Traitors, and the Faithfuls set off to unmask them.",
      "By the end of Episode 3, multiple players were banished, some were murdered and one Traitor was discovered. Read on for a recap of all the plotting and drama that went down.",
      "Episode 1",
      "The premiere begins with all of the players arriving at the darkened castle. After briefly meeting each other and seeing some familiar faces, they are informed about Cumming\u2019s \u201cSecret Traitor\u201d twist. Each player has a box with their name on it. One by one, they approach Cumming and he shows if their box contains a grim reaper card, confirming them as the Secret Traitor. Their identity is withheld from the audience. Everyone then moves into the castle and gathers around the Round Table for Cumming to choose the other Traitors.",
      "After covertly circling the room multiple times, he selects three Traitors to join his turret: \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d alum Lisa Rinna, former \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Candiace Dillard Bassett and Rob Rausch from \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6. Later in the turret that night, the three learn about the Secret Traitor (who wears a special red cloak) and their power. Every week, the Secret Traitor creates a shortlist of players to be murdered until all the Traitors have the chance to team up.",
      "The first mission requires the cast to divide into groups of three and find coffins marked with dollar signs in a loch. The coffins are then placed in one of the player\u2019s graves, meaning they are at risk for murder. At the end, nine players are on the chopping block.",
      "Back at the mansion, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams confronts actor Michael Rapaport after hearing from Dillard Bassett that he wanted to target all the housewives. But Dillard Bassett says that Williams misheard her, leading to more confusion. Cumming announces at the end of the episode to the audience that the Secret Traitor chose four out of the nine at risk players to be on the shortlist for murder. The three Traitors receive a letter from the Secret Traitor with the four names: Rausch, Ian Terry from \u201cBig Brother,\u201d Mark Ballas from \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and singer-songwriter Eric Nam.",
      "Episode 2",
      "The episode opens with \u201cThe Traitors\u201d tradition of having each player arrive for breakfast except one. Viewers discover that the Traitors chose to murder Ian Terry. In his final confessional, a disappointed Terry says, \u201cI had a feeling that was going to be the case. I just don\u2019t know what I could\u2019ve done differently. But, you know what, this is the biggest backhanded compliment in this game.\u201d",
      "Before the players depart for the second mission, Williams slips up again by accidentally saying that she \u201ckilled\u201d Terry, causing comedian Ron Funches\u2019 ears to perk up. At the mission, more drama unfolds, this time between \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Yamil \u201cYam Yam\u201d Arocho and \u201cLove Island\u201d UK star Maura Higgins. The players have to transport three players on a throne back to the castle. Along the way, they have to make multiple stops and collect gold or shields. The last players on the throne when they reach the castle will be safe from murder. Arocho takes Higgins' spot on the throne, securing his safety for the night, and Rapaport inserts himself in the conversation by claiming that he also needed a shield. He continues to call out Arocho in front of everyone when they return to the mansion. Meanwhile, Williams errs again by mentioning that there are four Traitors, adding to the list of evidence Funches is compiling.",
      "At the first Round Table, \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Natalie Anderson kicks things off by explaining why she thinks Donna \u201cMama\u201d Kelce is a Traitor. But Funches\u2019 theory about Williams is more compelling. It is a close vote, but Williams receives one more vote than Kelce and is banished. While standing on the Circle of Truth, Williams says, \u201cI came in and I tried to fight for the housewives and it almost started to feel like I\u2019m going to be the one who is going to help to lead us to find a Traitor the first time. I am a Faithful.\u201d The group is stunned and Funches says in his confessional that he feels like he put a target on his back.",
      "Toward the end of Episode 2, the Traitors are tasked with completing a covert murder in plain sight. The Traitors must find a set of tarot cards hidden in the kitchen that reveal the second shortlist from the Secret Traitor. Next, they have to take the card of the person they want to murder and burn it in the fireplace in the breakfast room. If successful, they can meet the Secret Traitor and unite. If unsuccessful, there will not be a murder that night and they will not have any control over the next murder.",
      "Rausch spots the red reaper painting in the kitchen and instantly knows that is where the tarot cards are hidden. Meanwhile, Dillard Bassett starts a Conga line to distract the rest of the players. But \u201cSurvivor\u201d star Rob Cesternino isn\u2019t fooled. He tells \u201cBig Brother\u201d alum Tiffany Mitchell that he suspects a murder is happening in plain sight and she needs to stay alert. He also shares this theory with Dillard Bassett and Ballas.",
      "Rausch takes the tarot cards to Rinna and they discuss the shortlist: \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d star Mon\u00e9t X Change, Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, \u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish and Cesternino. The two Traitors slip away to the breakfast room, without having time to consult with Dillard Bassett, and burn one card, murdering a player.",
      "Episode 3",
      "All the players safely arrive to breakfast the next morning except one: Cesternino. We see a flashback where he learned his fate. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they got me. I leave with no regrets. Traitors, I\u2019ll get you next time,\u201d he says.",
      "Rapaport abruptly starts targeting Arocho again about the shield from the last mission, rubbing multiple players the wrong way. Cumming arrives and shocks the players by sharing that there will be a morning Round Table meeting and banishment. Many of the players meet and agree that they will vote for Kelce to be banished. Kelce attempts to defend herself and suggests that Rapaport is a Traitor.",
      "But the players stand firm on their decision to banish her. They all vote to remove her from the game except Rapaport, who voted for Arocho, and Kelce, who voted for Rapaport.",
      "While standing on the Circle of Truth, Kelce says, \u201cI know I\u2019m the sacrificial lamb and I know that I had a blast meeting every single one of you. On that note, I think I\u2019m going to go \u2026 but you got yourself a Traitor!\u201d",
      "Kelce is then revealed as the Secret Traitor who was chosen by Cumming when they first arrived. The episode \u201crewinds\u201d to show the moments she met in secret with Cumming and planned her shortlists. Kelce says in her confessional that her strategy was to be a lovable mom figure during the day and a \u201cdevious Traitor at night.\u201d She says that she targeted players with her shortlists who were laying low and not speaking up.",
      "Reflecting on her game, she says, \u201cPlaying a Traitor was tough but I gave it my best shot. This has been a dream come true.\u201d Getting emotional, she adds, \u201cThese are happy tears that I get to do this at this point in my life. It\u2019s just the joy of being in the game.\u201d",
      "Cumming asks each player to pair up with the person they trust most. Funches is the odd person out, so he will be automatically shortlisted for murder. The duos select one person to be put in a cage and another to hunt for skulls and stack them in a tower. Kish, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star Caroline Stanbury, Rinna and Nam\u2019s partners are all unsuccessful which means they are at risk.",
      "The at-risk players are left behind and tied to trees where they wait to find out if they will be murdered by the Traitors face to face. After making their decision in the turret, the Traitors go to the woods and meet with each player. Nam pleads for his life in the game. Kish says she won\u2019t beg. Stanbury says she isn\u2019t ready to go and Funches threatens the Traitors.",
      "He says if they don\u2019t kill him now they will regret it later. \u201cShow me your faces!\u201d he shouts as the episode ends.",
      "Episodes 4 and 5 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d Season 4 will stream on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 15 at 6 p.m. PT/ 9 p.m. ET."

On the far west side of Los Angeles, the Palisades fire was also blazing and wreaking havoc. A total of 31 people died and the fires destroyed about 13,000 homes and residential properties, leaving thousands displaced.",
      "To pay tribute to the lives, homes and businesses lost, the one-night benefit concert brought the Altadena community together in hopes of raising money for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. The organization helps provide resources and options for people who want to stay and rebuild in Altadena.",

Every person in Altadena was affected at once, but everyone\u2019s stories are unique and different,\u201d co-producer and co-organizer Kevin Lyman, the creator of Warped Tour and longtime Altadena resident, tells TODAY.com. \u201c(We are) united under one tragedy.\u201d",
      "Approached by Dawes and guitarist Eric Krasno, Lyman teamed up with the two and began producing a show to support the community, raise funds and provide 250 tickets to Altadena residents directly impacted by the fire.",

      "Then, more women from Anna\u2019s past turn up dead: Helen Wang (Poppy Liu) and Zoe (Marin Ireland), each murder marked with friendship bracelets from their teenage years.",
      "Te series frames its central question clearly: Who killed Rachel, and which woman finally snapped?",
      "What Happened to Rachel in High School?",
      "By the finale, the show makes clear it was never about who lost control. It was about who remembered the past and decided to act on it.",
      "That past begins on Anna\u2019s 16th birthday.",
      "Anna, Rachel, Zoe, and Helen were once a tight-knit high-school friend group, inseparable on the surface. That night, under the guise of a celebration, Rachel, the group\u2019s ringleader, lured Anna and an awkward outsider named Catherine Kelly (Astrid Rotenberry) into the woods.",
      "What began as teenage cruelty escalated into something far darker. Older men were brought in. Photos were taken. Catherine managed to escape. Anna didn\u2019t. She was sexually assaulted while the girls she trusted stood by and watched.",
      "The trauma was buried for years, and the girls never told anyone.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, reinvents herself through massive weight loss and plastic surgery.",
      "Years later, she returns to town under a new name, Lexi Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), as a polished, ambitious news anchor who takes over Anna\u2019s job during her absence. Her reappearance ties the violence of the past directly to the present-day investigation, making her a natural suspect, even though she isn\u2019t responsible for the murders.",
      "Who Killed Rachel, Zoe and Helen?",
      "It isn\u2019t until decades later, after Anna loses her three-month-old daughter to sudden infant death syndrome, a tragedy that shatters her marriage and sends her into a year-long disappearance, that the truth fully resurfaces.",
      "While going through old tapes and mementos, Anna\u2019s mother, Mrs. Andrews, discovers footage from that night in the woods and realizes what really happened to her daughter.",
      "For a woman already grieving the loss of her granddaughter and watching her daughter fall apart, the discovery becomes a breaking point.",
      "The series ultimately reveals that Mrs. Andrews is the killer. She fakes dementia to move unnoticed and uses spare keys from her years working as a house cleaner to methodically kill Rachel, Helen, and Zoe, the women she believes destroyed Anna\u2019s life. Each murder is marked by a friendship bracelet, transforming symbols of teenage loyalty into reminders of betrayal.",
      "When Anna reads her mother\u2019s confession in the finale, her reaction is what makes the ending so chilling. She cries and then smiles. She doesn\u2019t turn her mother in. She doesn\u2019t confront her. She accepts what was had been done for her.",
      "Anna then makes her own choice. She never tells Jack the full truth about the woods and that she, not Catherine, had been sexually assaulted. She allows the safer version of the story to stand. And she raises Zoe\u2019s daughter, knowing her own mother killed Zoe, reframing the murder as a twisted attempt to give Anna back the family she lost.",
      "By the final moments, Anna has everything she once wanted: her career, a future, a family.",
      "But it\u2019s built on silence.",
      "\"His & Hers\" doesn\u2019t end by solving a crime. It ends by asking a far darker question, one that lingers long after the credits roll: If the truth only causes more pain, is it still worth telling, or is survival its own form of justice?"

The fact of it is what was hard. The actual breaking up of a family is what was hard. Losing a true partnership and friendship is what was hard.\u201d",

    "summary": "Stranger Things fans are convinced that the show didn't end. All about the Conformity Gate theory",
    "story": [
      "A group of \"Stranger Things\" fans are not ready for the story to be over.",
      "The viral theory dubbed Conformity Gate on social media proposes there is still one more episode left of the blockbuster Netflix hit beyond the two-hour series finale that was released on New Year's Eve.",
      "Fans believe that the real final episode will be released by Netflix on Jan. 7 to wrap up the story that ended in Episode 8 of Season 5, titled \"The Rightside Up.\" They think there is an Episode 9 that ends the series with a different storyline.",
      "Here's what to know about the online theories.",
      "What Is Conformity Gate?",
      "Warning: This section contains spoilers to the final season of \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "The epilogue to Episode 8 of the final season shows the long-time group of friends in fictional Hawkins, Indiana, graduate from high school and play a game of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" together like they did in the show's first season.",
      "Each character is then shown enjoying a happy ending to their individual story, from the romance between Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink) continuing to Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) thriving in college to Will (Noah Schnapp) living with a boyfriend in New York.",
      "Fans labeled the ending \"Conformity Gate\" because it represented  a frictionless, conformist ending rather than embracing the show's themes of breaking with the norm and defying external expectations.",
      "Why Do 'Stranger Things' Fans Believe There is Another Episode?",
      "Fans have gone down the rabbit hole with lengthy TikTok explainers and videos of scenes from the show's five seasons edited together to back up their theories.",
      "A theme behind the theories is that the happy endings for everyone were all an illusion created by the monstrous Vecna, the show's main villain. A humanoid that first appeared in Season 4, Vecna was originally human Henry Creel (Jamie Campbell Bower), who was sent to an alternate dimension by the powers of Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and became a monster.",
      "Fans have pointed out that all the students portrayed in the Hawkins graduation scene are sitting with their hands folded. They have likened the pose to one Creel once made before he became Vecna, as well as the character Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) when he was controlled by Vecna in Season 4.",
      "The ambiguous ending for Eleven, one of the show's primary characters, has also left fans divided over whether she died or not after defeating Vecna. Sink, who plays Max, has a clear position on it.",
      "Another image pushed by fans is that the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" binders owned by the main characters line up on a shelf to read \"X A LIE,\" which they think means that Vecna being beaten in Dimension X was a lie. However, on the show, it looks more like \"X AILE,\" which has no meaning.",
      "The speculation over the episode being released on Jan. 7 comes from multiple sources.",
      "Netflix released a cryptic teaser on Christmas saying \"Your Future is on its way\" with the date of Jan. 7, 2026, leading \"Stranger Things\" fans to thinking something big was coming even though it's not indicated in the video.",
      "The number seven also has meaning on \"Stranger Things\" because a die with the number seven facing up can be seen at the end of final episode to the right of a \"Stranger Things\" player manual. Noah Schnapp's character also rolls a seven while playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" in the show's first episode in the first season.",
      "Is There Another Episode Coming?",
      "Netflix has seemingly made it clear that the show is over with the bio on its Instagram and X accounts for \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "\"ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING,\" the bio reads.",
      "Schnapp, who plays Will Byers, also spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the end of the show.",
      "\"I remember crying a lot at the final table read,\" he said. \"They had us read it for the first time all together and I just think it was perfect. They really left nothing more to be told.\"",
      "\"Once I wrapped, I felt it was time to let Will go,\" he continued. \"Now I\u2019ve really made peace with it, and especially sharing these final episodes with the fans, the fact that these stories have been told and the journeys are done. Even though the story is over, I\u2019ll take with me the lessons I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m going to take the relationships with me forever, and I just hope this show can have a lasting, positive impact.\u201d",
      "For the final season, the streaming giant released the first four episodes on Thanksgiving, the next three on Christmas, and the final installment on New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "However, there is more coming out about Season Five. Netflix released a trailer on Jan. 5 for a documentary called \"One Last Adventure\" that will give a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the final season. The documentary starts streaming on Jan. 12.",
      "Twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, who created \"Stranger Things\" in 2016, were asked by the UK site Capital Buzz on Jan. 5 about theories that there is one more episode or an alternate ending that they shot and did not release.",
      "\u201cOh no,\u201d Matt Duffer said. \u201cI love when I hear people do that, but I\u2019m like, \u2018How do you have the time?\u2019 Oh my God! The energy to A, write it, and then shoot it. Are you crazy? No. No.\u201d",
      "While there is no indication of any secret episodes of \"Stranger Things,\" the Duffer brothers teased a spin-off of the show in a Jan. 1 interview with Variety. Matt Duffer said they will introduce \"completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.\u201d",
      "There also is a \"Stranger Things\" animated spin-off called \"Tales From '85\" set to come out in 2026."

    "story": [
      "BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Colombian officials began frantically calling Republicans in Congress seeking help to prevent a feared U.S. attack after President Donald Trump issued searing comments about their country\u2019s leader in the wake of the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a senior Colombian official tells NBC News.",
      "Aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump called his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, \u201ca sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\u201d adding: \u201cAnd he\u2019s not going to be doing it very long.\u201d",
      "Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary and one of the few Latin American leaders willing to vocally criticize Trump, on Tuesday said the American president had a \u201csenile brain.\u201d",
      "The Colombians asked members of Congress to help set up a phone call between Petro and Trump, which the Colombian government had wanted for some time. The official said the mediation paid off, with the two leaders speaking by phone on Wednesday, shortly before Petro was set to lead nationwide demonstrations in support of the country\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "The Trump-Petro call resulted in a dramatic de-escalation in tensions between the two men, with both leaders praising each other and announcing plans for a meeting in Washington next month.",
      "Colombia\u2019s Defense Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez told NBC News on Thursday that he planned to travel to Washington along with Petro to meet with American officials \u2014 and that he no longer had concerns the U.S. would launch a military attack on his country.",
      "\u201cI trust in the word of the president of the United States,\u201d he said, adding that the conversation had been a crucial \u201cicebreaker\u201d for the two leaders and countries.",
      "Something Trump said on the call made a particular impression on Petro, the Colombian leader said in a Thursday interview with NBC News partner Telemundo.",
      "\u201cI know you have been surrounded by lies like I have,\u201d Petro said Trump had told him during a  55-minute telephone conversation.",
      "In a Truth Social post sent a short while later, Trump wrote that it had been a \u201cGreat Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had.\u201d",
      "In another post on Friday, Trump said he was looking forward to meeting Petro at the White House in February, adding: \u201cI am sure it will work out very well for Colombia, and the U.S.A., but, cocaine and other drugs must be STOPPED from coming into the United States.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about the flurry of calls that preceded the conversation between the two leaders, nor about Trump\u2019s comment to Petro that they both were \u201csurrounded by lies.\u201d",
      "Colombian leaders, including Petro and S\u00e1nchez, appeared  gratified by the language Trump used when describing the conversation."

    "story": [
      "HAVANA \u2014 The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis.",
      "Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba\u2019s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba\u2019s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",
      "\u201cIf oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,\u201d said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. \u201cThis would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.\u201d",
      "Expecting more hardship",
      "In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%.",
      "\u201cThe situation here is going to become very difficult,\u201d said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. \u201cImagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts \u2026 young people are going to become even more pessimistic.\u201d",
      "There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cghost ships\u201d with their transponders turned off haven\u2019t slipped in.",
      "Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,\u201d Pi\u00f1\u00f3n said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia.",
      "Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country\u2019s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was \u201cpartially paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Content creator Pedro Luis Garc\u00eda said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don\u2019t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.\u201d",
      "Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%.",
      "Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen.",
      "Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government\u2019s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns.",
      "For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island\u2019s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba\u2019s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours.",
      "Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way.",
      "Cuba\u2019s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were \u201cpouring\u201d through Mexico and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d",
      "A defiant government response",
      "The day Maduro was captured, Cuba\u2019s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech. D\u00edaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the \u201cobscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel also said that \u201cfor Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.\u201d",
      "Cuba\u2019s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday.",
      "Cuba\u2019s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks.",
      "In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, declined to say what kind of further actions the U.S. could take against Cuba.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Cuba is already under heavy U.S. sanctions, but there are still other actions the U.S. can take. During Trump\u2019s first administration, the U.S. banned all flights to Cuba except for Havana.",
      "In Havana, former senior Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told NBC News, \u201cWe need to see what repercussions this will have. But the world hasn\u2019t ended as it seemed, and as Marco Rubio and Donald Trump would like to portray it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they are using intimidation to see if they can affect relations between Venezuela and Cuba, which I would say are not currently affected because Cuba and most Cubans support Venezuela in condemning the U.S. aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "Alzugaray added that Cuba\u2019s government should be in the midst of intense conversations and consultations with its allies, like China and Russia.",
      "Cuba, with a Soviet-style command economy, has been unwilling to loosen restrictions on the private sector and open its economy to foreign investment, as many allies like Vietnam and China have urged it to do.",
      "Vidal, the economist, said that when the USSR collapsed, it took the Cuban economy four years to hit rock bottom and begin to recover. Tourism, remittances and foreign investment helped rescue the economy from collapse in those years, something that hasn\u2019t happened this time around.",
      "\u201cToday, there is widespread distrust among the Cuban government\u2019s own international allies regarding the viability of its economic model and its finances,\u201d Vidal said. \u201cIn the 1990s, there was a stronger and more respected political leadership, both nationally and internationally, which is not the case now.\u201d",
      "Orlando Matos reported from Havana and Carmen Sesin from Miami."

      "In a private phone call a week ago, Trump told Nicol\u00e1s Maduro that he had to go.",
      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",

      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",

      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",

The country\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the government \u2014 roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself.",
      "The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime \u2014 including former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday \u2014 were best positioned to lead Venezuela\u2019s government and maintain stability.",
      "That assessment factored in President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News.",

But that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. \u201cSomehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.\u201d",

Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024.",
      "Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory.",
      "Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocor\u00f3n jail. He is now outside Venezuela.",
      "\u201cMany say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, change is closer than ever. Nicol\u00e1s is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,\u201d added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. \u201cFreedom is about to arrive.\u201d",
      "Whether or not \u201cfreedom\u201d is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as president and the country\u2019s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday.",

Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader.",

      "Marlenis, a domestic worker in Caracas, doesn\u2019t seem too worried about Trump\u2019s plans for Venezuela. She says that after 25 years of a system that has made her poorer every day, Venezuelans have nothing to lose by trying something different.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we lose?\u201d she said, while waiting for the bus to go home after work. \u201cIf everything goes badly, people are already used to bad things.\u201d"

Analysts have questioned the weapon's utility, and its deployment  appeared to be the Kremlin's latest attempt to send a threatening message to Kyiv and the West with peace talks stalled.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said early Friday that it had carried out the \u201cmassive strike\u201d against critically important targets in response to an alleged Ukrainian drone strike late last year on a residence used by President Vladimir Putin.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the U.S. from international organizations affiliated with the United Nations leaves the country without a meaningful voice in global climate talks.",
      "In an executive order Wednesday, Trump suspended U.S. support for 66 international bodies and commissions, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which the U.S. joined in 1992, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produces the world\u2019s premier climate reports.",
      "In a post on X, the White House said the organizations \u201cno longer serve American interests.\u201d",
      "The move is yet another sign that the Trump administration is abandoning all efforts to fight climate change, rolling back these policies at a time when global warming is making weather disasters more frequent and intense across the country. Extreme events like wildfires, floods and hurricanes already cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars every year. In 2025, 23 weather and climate events exceeded $1 billion in damages, costing a total of around $115 billion, according to an analysis released Thursday by the nonprofit organization Climate Central.",
      "The withdrawal is an escalation of the U.S.\u2019 rejection of climate diplomacy under Trump, further isolating the country from the global aim of slowing warming and staving off the most catastrophic effects of climate change.",
      "Trump began the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in January 2025. The accord, signed in 2016, stipulated that the 195 participating nations would work to limit greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the planet wouldn\u2019t warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with an upper limit of 2 degrees C.",
      "The UNFCCC created the underlying structure that the Paris Agreement later built upon. It was established in 1992 to inventory and begin to address the primary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. President George Bush signed the treaty after the Senate delivered its consent in a two-thirds vote.",
      "If the U.S. completes its exit from the UNFCCC \u2014 a process that takes a year \u2014 it would be the first country ever to do so. Re-entering the UNFCCC treaty would require a new two-thirds vote from the Senate, so Trump\u2019s withdrawal could make it difficult for a future president to rejoin the Paris Agreement.",
      "Withdrawing from the UNFCCC would also leave the U.S. as one of the only nations without representation at international climate talks. Already, the White House declined to send an official delegation to the latest U.N. climate summit, COP30, in Brazil last fall.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at all these conventions and the history of participation, even when countries were not really actively engaged in negotiations, it\u2019s pretty astonishing to walk away from the table and have decisions taken without your input,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, a climate scientist at the University of Washington who has contributed to several Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.",
      "Previous U.S. administrations have not always been enthusiastic participants in international climate discussions, Ebi added, but they still kept tabs on them.",
      "\u201cPeople showed up, sat in the back and did crossword puzzles and never said a word, but they wanted to hear what the discussions were,\u201d she said. Now, \u201cit\u2019s isolation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has expressed open hostility for the UNFCCC and other international organizations. In a statement on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them \u201canti-American, useless or wasteful.\u201d",
      "The U.S. will officially exit the Paris Agreement on Jan. 27 \u2014 roughly a year after the Trump administration initiated the nation\u2019s exit from the deal.",
      "However, legal questions remain as to whether Trump has the power to exit the UNFCCC without Congress\u2019 consent.",
      "Jean Su, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who directs its energy justice program, said her organization views the move as illegal.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution has articulated what it takes to get into a treaty, which is two-thirds of the Senate majority, but it is actually silent on what it takes to leave a treaty,\u201d Su said. \u201cThere has not been affirmative case law either way as to whether a president can unilaterally pull out of a treaty that was approved by two-thirds of the Senate. So we are looking at legal action.\u201d",
      "The UNFCCC is the world\u2019s facilitator of global climate negotiations. Each year, a host country organizes a Conference of the Parties (COP), in which all participating nations meet to discuss things like emission targets and how to fund climate action globally. Last year\u2019s meeting focused, in part, on the Amazon rainforest and how to address deforestation and climate effects there. The UNFCCC secretariat helps organize these events, creating a structure and facilitating the meetings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like hosting the Olympics \u2014 you don\u2019t do that without the organization to help,\u201d Ebi said.",
      "When the U.S. left the Paris Agreement, it created a budget hole for the UNFCCC. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charity organization of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, stepped in to fill that gap and keep the secretariat operating.",
      "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), meanwhile, is an independent body designed to provide policymakers with the best science about climate change, its effects and how it could be addressed. This organization\u2019s reports form the scientific understanding for UNFCCC discussions and treaties.",
      "In a statement, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, said Trump\u2019s exit \u201cwill leave the US less secure and less prosperous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Throughout his first year in office, Trump has made climate programs a target of dramatic budget cuts. He has called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and the administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay key climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment. It is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes global warming.",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, a climate activist, said Wednesday on X that the Trump administration has been \u201cturning its back on the climate crisis since day one,\u201d accusing it of catering to the interests of the oil industry while \u201cendangering people in America and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy withdrawing from the IPCC, UNFCCC, and the other vital international partnerships, the Trump Administration is undoing decades of hard-won diplomacy, attempting to undermine climate science, and sowing distrust around the world,\u201d Gore said."

      "The ship had changed its name to the Marinera and hoisted a Russian flag after escaping the U.S. blockade of Venezuela last month.",
      "On the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024, it was a \u201cposter child\u201d for the shadow fleet operations, said Richard Meade, editor-in-chief of Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime data analysis company.",
      "\u201cIt has operated out of Iran, out of Russia, out of Venezuela. It\u2019s done all of it, and it\u2019s done all of it while cycling through various false identities, false flags, with questionable or no insurance. It\u2019s exactly what the shadow fleet is there to do. It\u2019s to operate in the shadows,\u201d Meade told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "Ships like it smuggle oil for countries facing international sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, and often conceal or spoof their location data. Many are barely seaworthy and often engage in ship-to-ship transfers of their cargo while at sea in an effort to obscure the oil\u2019s origin.",
      "Data from the International Maritime Organization ship registry shows that the tanker\u2019s registered owner is a company called Burevestmarine LLC, headquartered in Russia\u2019s western Ryazan region. The company appears in Russia\u2019s state commercial register and lists Ilya Bugai as the company\u2019s director. NBC News could not immediately identify a way to contact Bugai.",
      "Russia has faced a slew of new sanctions in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine, including on its oil. It has resorted to using the shadow fleet to sell its discounted crude oil to allies to keep afloat its economy, which has required enormous military investment to sustain the war.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics\u2019 year-end analysis, Russia\u2019s shadow fleet continues to play a key role in transporting Russian oil. Its \u201cRussian Oil Tracker\u201d estimates that 173 Russian shadow fleet tankers carrying crude oil and oil products departed Russian ports and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers in the month of November.",
      "For years, Kyiv has been calling for a greater crackdown on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet.",
      "\u201cPutin uses these tankers to finance his war, and most of these vessels are old, poorly maintained, and operate without any oversight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in late 2024. His foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Wednesday that Ukraine welcomed the tanker\u2019s seizure and Trump\u2019s \u201cact, not fear\u201d approach.",
      "And while the seizure of the Bella 1 is unlikely to break the Russian economy, it adds a layer of complexity for the Kremlin and leaves the fate of other tankers uncertain.",
      "At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have also changed their flags to Russia\u2019s, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping.",
      "\u201cRussia is increasingly taking direct control of its export capabilities,\u201d said Meade. \u201cAnd certainly in the last four months, we have seen a rapid increase of shadow fleet ships flagging to Russia. Now, given that they were unable to protect the Marinera, the question is, Will shadow fleet operators be quite so willing to move into Russia, and will Russia really want to keep pursuing that agenda of taking direct control of the shadow fleet?\u201d",
      "A lot now depends on whether the U.S., and to some extent the European Union and the U.K., are going to be prepared to execute seizures like the one conducted on Wednesday to try and disrupt those exports via shadow fleet ships.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this was an anomaly or the start of a pattern of more robust enforcement,\u201d Meade said.",
      "What it means for Ukraine",
      "That uncertainty could be the reason behind Russia\u2019s muted response to the tanker seizure so far.",
      "While some Russian lawmakers have called it \u201cpiracy on the high seas,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry appealed for \u201chumane\u201d treatment of the tanker\u2019s crew even as it urged Washington \u201cto return to compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation\u201d on Thursday.",
      "There has been no reaction from the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson or Putin himself.",
      "Moscow may want to be careful not to offend Trump while he is negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine that at times has seen him support Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "It could also explain why Putin has not personally addressed the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The operation to remove Maduro is a blow to the Kremlin, depriving it of a longtime ally. But what Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry condemned as an \u201cact of armed aggression\u201d left some of its influential military bloggers jealous of Washington\u2019s success.",
      "When Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, he hoped to take Kyiv and capture Zelenskyy in as little as three days, expecting little resistance from Ukraine's army. His plan centered on seizing the Hostomel airfield, a crucial staging post for an assault on the capital, but Putin\u2019s forces got bogged down and eventually withdrew.",
      "Trump\u2019s removal of Maduro, which took hours and resulted in no U.S. deaths, drew admiration and unfavorable comparisons from Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cZ bloggers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost likely, our own special military operation was conceived in much the same way: fast, effective,\u201d wrote prominent channel Two Majors, referring to the Kremlin\u2019s term for its war in Ukraine. Another prominent Z-blogger, Voenny Osvedomitel, called it a \u201cmodel military operation.\u201d",
      "Still, the focus on Venezuela could help distract from Putin\u2019s reticence to strike a deal with Ukraine.",
      "And Trump\u2019s stated desire to dominate the Western Hemisphere lends validation to the ideas underpinning the Kremlin\u2019s war: that great powers should be entitled to spheres of influence. In Putin\u2019s eyes, at least, Russia\u2019s sphere includes former Soviet states like Ukraine."

      "Protesters in Iran defied authorities Tuesday, hitting the streets in the capital, Tehran, and smaller cities to chant anti-government slogans amid an ongoing violent crackdown that one human rights group says has left at least 36 dead.",
      "The protests began last week with economic grievances as the Iranian currency, the rial, tanked. They quickly turned political, with demonstrators chanting slogans against the ruling clergy.",
      "The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago \u2014 34 protesters and two members of the security forces \u2014 and that more than 2,000 people have been arrested.",
      "Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran\u2019s main bazaar Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.",
      "Another video shows a person using a makeshift flamethrower on security forces in the southern city of Shiraz.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for protesters' demands to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement.",
      "But the head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, warned Wednesday that there would be \u201cno leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic.\u201d Accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country, Ejei was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying there was \u201cno excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest.\u201d",
      "But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian\u2019s efforts at mediation \u2014 and the killings and arrests by security forces \u2014 have not persuaded the protesters to stay off the streets.",
      "\u201cThe system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. \u201cThe fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.\u201d",

      "The detention of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a staunch Tehran ally, over the weekend only highlighted the issue for Iranian officials.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the operation to detain Maduro \"a clear example of state terrorism\" in a telephone call with his Venezuelan counterpart Saturday, according to the Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry\u2019s official website.",
      "\u201cWhat the threshold for U.S. intervention would be, or what it might look like, is not entirely clear but the leadership in Tehran is likely worried about the prospect of dealing with not just instability from below but military action from abroad,\u201d Vaez said.",
      "Some of the worst violence in recent days took place in the small town of Malekshahi and nearby Ilam in western Iran.

      "The wounded and dead from Saturday's violence in Malekshahi were taken to the Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam, where security forces stormed the compound and used batons, tear gas and live fire, according to Hengaw. A video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, shows a member of the security forces shooting into the hospital courtyard where people were gathered behind a gate.",

      "\u201cSecurity in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\u201d said the statement, issued by the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark.",
      "It added that \u201cthe United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally\u201d and through a 1951 defense agreement allowing Washington to build military bases on the vast island. \u201cGreenland belongs to its people,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\u201d",
      "Outgoing centrist Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., called the statement \"embarrassing for the U.S.\" in a post on X.",
      "\"Denigrating our Allies serves no purpose and there is NO up side,\" he said. \"It weakens us by diminishing trust between friends, and Russia and China love it. So\u2026 stop the stupid 'we want Greenland BS.'\"",
      "One of the key elements being discussed in Paris is Ukraine and Europe\u2019s desire for \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d which could come in the form of a multinational force being deployed to Ukraine to ensure Russia does not launch further attacks.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron had said Tuesday\u2019s gathering of the so-called coalition of the willing would see the powers \u201cmake concrete commitments\u201d to Ukraine\u2019s security as part of any future peace deal with Russia.",
      "Kyiv and its allies have consistently said that this would need to be backed by American military power. But Trump has indicated he may instead turn that might against a NATO ally, telling NBC News on Monday that he was \u201cvery serious\u201d in his ambitions to take control of Greenland.",
      "Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, took this a step further. He told CNN that \"obviously Greenland should be part of the U.S.\" because of what he described as the island's geostrategic importance in helping Washington fulfill its role as \"the power of NATO.\"",
      "\"The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\" he said. \"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over Greenland,\" Miller added.",
      "Any U.S. action against Greenland would be a dramatic and historic escalation, even when set against Trump\u2019s past hostility toward Washington\u2019s erstwhile European allies.",
      "Denmark is a NATO partner, and dozens of its troops died fighting in U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "Many experts believe that U.S. military action to seize the territory would spell the end of the alliance and mark a new nadir for transatlantic ties that are already strained under Trump.",
      "\u201cIt would de facto mean that NATO was dead because many European nations would simply say, \u2018OK, we cannot rely on the Americans anymore,\u2019\u201d said Peter Viggo Jakobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said much the same Monday, telling her country\u2019s TV2 broadcaster that \u201cif the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops.\u201d",
      "Even without the building panic over Greenland, it remains a colossal ask to bridge the chasm between Russia\u2019s insistence on its hard-line demands and the fears held by Ukraine and Europe that President Vladimir Putin may use a deal as a launchpad to attack again.",
      "Zelenskyy said that a peace deal is \u201c90%\u201d there, albeit suggesting that the final 10% contains the thorniest issues.",
      "It is unclear whether Russia will ever accept any form of security guarantee, with Putin wavering little in his demand for Ukraine\u2019s effective surrender."

      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for more than a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "Venezuela will not have new elections in the next 30 days, President Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Monday, projecting a longer-term engagement two days after U.S. forces captured that nation's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We have to fix the country first. You can\u2019t have an election. There\u2019s no way the people could even vote,\" Trump said about the possibility of a vote in the next month. \"No, it\u2019s going to take a period of time. We have \u2014 we have to nurse the country back to health.\"",
      "Moreover, he said, the U.S. may subsidize an effort by oil companies to rebuild the country's energy infrastructure \u2014 a project he said could take less than 18 months.",
      "\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,\" he said. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\"",
      "He also insisted the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.",
      "\"No, we\u2019re not,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re at war with people that sell drugs. We\u2019re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country.\"",
      "In the roughly 20-minute interview, Trump identified a group of U.S. officials \u2014 including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who will help oversee America\u2019s involvement in Venezuela.",
      "\"It's a group of all. They have all expertise, different expertise,\" he said.",
      "But he had a one-word answer for who is ultimately in charge: \u201cMe.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s discussion of his vision for Venezuela came just a couple of hours after Maduro was arraigned in New York on a series of charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. He was seized from a compound in the capital city of Caracas in the wee hours of Saturday morning during a raid by U.S. special forces and law enforcement officials.",
      "Maduro pleaded not guilty, saying he remains the leader of his country even as Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in Monday as his successor.",
      "Trump said Rodr\u00edguez has been cooperating with U.S. officials but insisted there was no communication between her camp and the American side before Maduro's ouster.",
      "\"No, that\u2019s not the case,\" he said, adding that a determination will be made soon about whether existing sanctions against Rodr\u00edguez will be left in place or lifted.",
      "When asked if there was \"any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove\" Maduro, Trump replied, \"Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,\" adding that it was without the help of Maduro's inner circle.",
      "Trump also declined to say whether he's spoken to Rodr\u00edguez yet, but he said that Rubio \"speaks to her fluently in Spanish\" and that their \"relationship has been very strong.\"",
      "He indicated that the U.S. could launch a second military incursion into Venezuela if Rodr\u00edguez stops cooperating with U.S. officials but said he does not believe that will be necessary. Trump also suggested he had initially expected to have to send in American forces again already.",
      "\"We\u2019re prepared to do it,\" he said. \"We anticipated doing it, actually.\"",
      "Trump also denied a Washington Post report that he had dismissed the possibility of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado running the country because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year \u2014 an award long sought by Trump.",
      "\"She should not have won it,\" he said. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\"",
      "Having campaigned on an \"America First\" platform and his desire to end wars, rather than start them, Trump has seen some of his political allies question the wisdom of the U.S. entering into a long-term commitment in Venezuela.",
      "But he said in the interview that he is confident his political base will stick with him.",
      "\"MAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I\u2019m doing. MAGA loves everything I do,\" Trump said. \"MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\"",
      "Critics in both parties have noted that Trump did not seek a new authorization from Congress to launch Saturday morning's raid, and he said in the interview that he would not need lawmakers to act in order for him to send American troops back in.",
      "\"We have good support congressionally,\" he said. \"And Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn't they support us?\"",
      "When asked what Congress \"knew\" \u2014 and whether any lawmakers had advance notification about the operation \u2014 Trump declined to elaborate.",
      "\"I don't want to get into that,\" he replied, \"but people knew.\""
