      "Iran has summoned France\u2019s representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime\u2019s oppression.\u201d",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has summoned France's representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression.\u201d",
      "Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had praised \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d after it won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. The Iranian film centers on a man who abducts his suspected captor after being tortured in prison.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the French charge d\u2019affaires was summoned over the minister\u2019s \u201cinterventionist, irresponsible and instigative allegations,\u201d the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "\u201cSpare us Iranians the lectures. You have no moral authority whatsoever,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on \u201cX,\u201d citing France's approach to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. France last week threatened \u201cconcrete action\u201d against Israel if the country didn't halt the offensive in Gaza and lift restrictions on humanitarian aid, but the statement was mostly dismissed as empty threats.",
      "Immediately following the award's announcement, the Iranian state news agency had announced a more muted celebration of the award, crediting the country\u2019s film industry for winning a second Palme d\u2019Or after Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s 1997 drama, \u201cTaste of Cherry.\"",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won\u2019t allow him to make the films he wants to, and \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was filmed without cooperation. Iranian state TV called the film a mixture of \u201clie and smearing\u201d as well as an \u201cunderground\u201d film produced without required permits in Iran. State TV also chastised Panahi for not mentioning the plight of the Palestinians in his acceptance speech.",
      "The film follows a man named Vahid, played by Vahid Mobasser, who believes he sees his former captor, who tortured him in prison and ruined his life. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In a strange and emotional journey, they are all forced to grapple with revenge and forgiveness. Panahi drew on the experiences from his own imprisonment as well as the stories of detainees around him.",
      "Other state media were more critical of the win. The Mizan news agency, an arm of the country\u2019s judiciary, reported on the win as part of the \u201cPolitical Cannes Film Festival,\u201d suggesting that the prize was given to Panahi because of his political leanings.",
      "Pro-reform media outlets and activists praised Panahi. \u201cThis victory is no accident \u2014 it is the result of a tireless dedication to exploring humanistic values and human rights,\u201d said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was also previously imprisoned at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison. Inmates at the prison include those with Western ties and political prisoners.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in anti-government protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "Panahi was arrested in 2022 when he went to the Tehran prosecutor\u2019s office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve six years for an earlier sentence on charges of propagandizing against the government from 2011 that had never been enforced. In early 2023, Panahi went on a hunger strike and was released from Evin Prison.",
      "Panahi said he would not seek asylum in another country, despite the risks of additional imprisonment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he said last week from the Cannes festival. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Panahi landed in Tehran to cheers and applause from fans.",

      "King Charles III arrives in Ottawa on Monday to underscore Canada\u2019s sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- King Charles III arrives in Ottawa this week to underscore Canada's sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government's agenda for the new Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cHis Majesty King Charles III will read the speech from the throne and thus present the plan of our government, our priorities, as Canada is facing a pivotal moment in its history, the biggest transformation of the global trading system since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" Carney told his caucus Sunday.",
      "Carney said \u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in the sovereign\" when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe are different and the king illustrates that,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cIf you look at why King Charles is reading the speech from the throne than you have to then acknowledge Canada\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there\u2019s a message to be sent there\u2019s easier ways to do that like calling him or calling the president.",
      "Royal historian Carolyn Harris expects Trump to notice the visit because the president has repeatedly spoken about his admiration for the royal family.",
      "Harris said Trump might see how different Canada is from the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is a very distinctive history that goes back to the waves of loyalists who settled here after the American revolution,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to seeing the king in a Canadian context, escorted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, surrounded by Canadian symbolism. This is very much King Charles III in his role as King of Canada.\u201d",
      "The speech, which will be delivered Tuesday, is not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state. The king will read what is put before him by Canada\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCharles can only act with the consent and with the advice of his prime minister. But at the same time he cannot act in a way that would throw any of the other 14 Commonwealth realms under the bus. So it is finest tightrope to walk,\" said Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian.",
      "Canadians were not happy when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended a state visit invitation to Trump on behalf of the king during a time when Trump threatened Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTo be frank,\u201d Carney told Britain's Sky News. \u201cThey weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance. It was a time when we were quite clear ... about the issues around sovereignty.\"",
      "The king has more recently been showing support for Canada, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a British aircraft carrier.",
      "After he arrives on Monday he will drop the ceremonial first puck or ball during a street hockey game. He will also attend a community event and meet with Carney and Canada's governor general, his representative as head of state. The king will return to the U.K. after Tuesday's speech and a visit to Canada's National War Memorial.",

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi\u2019s revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d has won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday",
      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi's name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "The win for \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d'Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cAnora,\u201d won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was inspired by Panahi's experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "Panahi was jailed in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.",
      "In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\u201d Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \u201cArt will always win. What is human will always win.\u201d",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "\u201cA day without electricity,\" sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d at the ceremony. The festival's films, he said, supplied \u201call the needed electricity.\"",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier\u2019s Norwegian family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d his lauded follow-up to \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Some had expected \u201cSentimental Value\u201d to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\u201d",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \u201cThat was our wish.\u201d",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \u201cshow that our country\u2019s cinema is second to none.\u201d",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \u201cThe Little Sister,\u201d Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \u201cYoung Mothers.\u201d Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival's award for best first film, the Camera d'Or, went to Hasan Hadi for \u201cThe President's Cake,\u201d making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "Saturday's ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival. At the opening ceremony, honorary Palme d'Or recipient Robert De Niro called Trump \u201cAmerica's philistine president.\u201d",
      "Other top American films in Cannes included Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d (which pulled Lee away from his New York Knicks but not out of their blue and orange color), the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning,\" and Ari Aster's \u201cEddington,\u201d which found a divisive reaction.",
      "Panahi's win put him in rare company. He's now won Cannes' Palme d'Or, Venice's Golden Lion (for \u201cThe Circle\u201d) and Berlin's Golden Bear (for \u201cTaxi\u201d). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.",
      "Addressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, \u201ceven in complicated situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey must realize that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cYou have this power.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars: Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and relative newcomer Harris Dickinson.",
      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",
      "Yuknavitch's memoir recounts her surviving sexual abuse by her father and how she sought refuge in competitive swimming and, later, writing.",
      "While Stewart expressed doubts that she offered much to her film's star, Imogen Poots, in terms of useful direction, the actor disagrees.",
      "\u201cKristen is incredibly present but at the same has this ability, like a plant or something, to pick up on a slight shift in the atmosphere where it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Poots said, causing Stewart to laugh. \u201cThere is this insane brain at play and it\u2019s a skill set that comes in the form of an intense curiosity.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, died at 81 from leukemia, his family said Friday. Local media reported he died in Paris, where he lived for more than 55 years.",
      "Salgado's style is marked by black-and-white imagery, rich tonality, and emotionally charged scenarios. Many of his best pictures were taken in impoverished communities, especially in the Amazon and in Africa. He was recently experiencing undisclosed health problems.",
      "\u201cThrough the lens of his camera, Sebasti\u00e3o tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world,\u201d Salgado's family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che, a major French composer who worked with Salgado for his exhibition \u201cAqua Mater\u201d in Paris, said the Brazilian was an \u201cauthentic and warm man\u201d.",
      "\u201cHis gaze transformed landscapes, and beyond the spectacular, he reached a kind of inner truth (\u2026). With him, photography fulfilled one of its highest ambitions by going far beyond mere appearances,\u201d M\u00e2che told The Associated Press.",
      "Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Salgado was passionate about their city.",
      "\u201cTonight I cry for a very close friend, a rare soul; a loyal, discreet and sensible man. His death moves us profoundly. He already leaves us an immense void,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cParis, the city that loved him, will give him the honors he deserves.\u201d",
      "An exhibition of about 400 of Salgado\u2019s works is currently on display in the city of Deauville, in northern France.",
      "Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, which published several of Salgado\u2019s works over the last decades, said he recently canceled a meeting with journalists in the French city of Reims due to health problems. He was scheduled to attend an exhibition with works by his son Rodrigo for a church in the same city on Saturday, the daily reported.",
      "Salgado and his wife had been working since the 1990s to restore part of the Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais. In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",
      "So far, Instituto Terra has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimores, which lies in what was once a somewhat deserted region in the countryside of the Minas Gerais state. The photographer was born there in 1944.",
      "In an undated interview with Forbes Brasil published on Thursday, Salgado said that attending the exhibition of his works in Deuville felt like a stroll through his life.",
      "\u201cHow many times in my life have I put my camera to the side and sat down to cry? Sometimes it was too dramatic, and I was alone. That's the power of the photographer; to be able to be there,\u201d Salgado said.",
      "\u201cIf a photographer is not there, there's no image. We need to be there. We expose ourselves a lot. And that is why it is such an immense privilege.\u201d",

      "Buble, a five-time Grammy-winning pop icon, has signed on to be part of the team's fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",
      "The program is the brainchild of Panthers hockey operations president and general manager Bill Zito and his wife Julie Zito.",
      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",
      "The program formally launched in March and has been backed by famed artist Romero Britto along with NFL players \u2014 and South Florida natives \u2014 Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa, among others.",

      "King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States",
      "TORONTO -- King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne on Tuesday where he will lay out the Canadian government\u2019s agenda when Parliament reopens.",
      "The monarch is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in our sovereign,\" Carney said when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, only did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cWe are not the United States. It sounds simple, but that\u2019s what the visit says.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same institutions. We don\u2019t have the same history,\u201d Charest said. \"We are a different country with a different choice in terms of how how we built ourselves, and King Charles tells that story.\u201d",
      "This will be Charles' first visit as monarch. He visited Canada 19 times as prince. The king has been showing his support for Canada in recent months, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.",
      "Historian Robert Bothwell said that the king\u2019s speech in Parliament \u201cis a gesture of solidarity and identity that can be construed to be a gesture of support.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn't necessary.",
      "\u201cWe're thrilled that the king will be here. If there's a message in there, you know, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,\u201d Hoekstra told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cBut I know what the implication is. It's, oh about ... the 51st state, it's over. And, you know, move on.\u201d",
      "The speech sets the legislative agenda for a new session of Parliament. It's not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state.",
      "The king will read what is put before him by Canada's prime minister and his team. The speech is usually read by Canada's governor general, the monarch's representative in Canada. The governor general holds a constitutional but mostly ceremonial and symbolic position.",
      "\u201cKing Charles is unlikely to comment directly on the 51st state issue. Yet, his introductory remarks could feature broad statements about Canada\u2019s integrity and sovereignty. At least this is what many Canadians would like him to do,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Former Canadian prime ministers and governor generals will attend the speech. The king will then pay his respects at the National War Memorial before a Royal Canadian Air Force flyby.",
      "B\u00e9land said the monarchy has long been unpopular among Quebec\u2019s French-speaking majority, and some nationalist voices in the province have been critical of the Carney government\u2019s decision to invite the king to deliver the throne speech.",
      "\"Whether the separatists work themselves into a lather over this frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think Quebecers will care a lot,\u201d said Charest, the former premier of Quebec. \u201cThe may not like the monarchy or whatever they\u2019d like to read into it, but British institutions have served us very well.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\u201cBut with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\u201d the CCTV commentary said.",

      "It's been nearly a decade since robbers stormed Kim Kardashian\u2019s luxury residence and tied her up at gunpoint",
      "PARIS -- The Paris robbery of Kim Kardashian lasted only minutes \u2014 but its impact reverberated for nearly a decade.",
      "On Friday, a court in the French capital will decide the verdict in one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history \u2014 the night masked men stormed the star\u2019s luxury apartment, tied her up at gunpoint and vanished into the dark with $6 million in jewels.",
      "Nine men and a woman stand accused of carrying out or aiding the crime during the Paris Fashion Week in 2016, when the robbers, dressed as police, forced their way into the glamorous H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, bound her with zip ties and escaped with her jewelry \u2014 a theft that would force celebrities to rethink how they live and protect themselves.",
      "After delivering final statements in court, the defendants were dismissed Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.",
      "Among them was 69-year-old Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the alleged ringleader, who arrived at court walking with a stick, his face hidden from cameras. Prosecutors have asked for a 10-year sentence. His DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Khedache says he was only a foot soldier. He blamed a mysterious \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 someone prosecutors say never existed.",
      "His lawyer pleaded for clemency, pointing to one of the trial\u2019s most visceral moments \u2014 Kardashian\u2019s earlier courtroom encounter with the man accused of orchestrating her ordeal. Though she wasn't present Friday, her words \u2014 and the memory of that moment \u2014 still echoed.",
      "\u201cShe looked at him when she came, she listened to the letter he had written to her, and then she forgave him,\u201d lawyer Franck Berton told The Associated Press.",
      "Kardashian, typically shielded by security and spectacle, had locked eyes with Khedache as the letter was read aloud.",
      "\u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed.\u201d A tabloid crime had become something raw and human.",
      "Khedache on Friday asked for \u201ca thousand pardons,\u201d communicated via a written note in court. Other defendants also used their final words to express remorse.",
      "The accused became known in France as \u201cles papys braqueurs\u201d \u2014 the grandpa robbers. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. Some read the proceedings from a screen, hard of hearing and nearly mute. But prosecutors warned observers not to be seduced by soft appearances.",
      "The trial is being heard by a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will need a majority vote to reach a decision.",
      "The defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, some of them could face life in prison.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony earlier this month was the emotional high point. In a packed courtroom, she recounted how she was thrown onto a bed, zip-tied, and had a gun pressed to her on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\u201d",
      "She was dragged into a marble bathroom and told to stay silent. When the robbers fled, she freed herself by scraping the tape on her wrists off against the sink, then hid with her friend, shaking and barefoot.",
      "She said that Paris had once been her sanctuary \u2014 a city she would wander at 3 a.m., window shopping, stopping for hot chocolate. That illusion was shattered.",
      "The robbery echoed far beyond the City of Light. It forced a recalibration of celebrity behavior in the age of Instagram. For years, Kardashian had curated her life like a showroom: geo-tagged, diamond-lit, public by design. But this was the moment the showroom turned into a crime scene. In her words, \u201cPeople were watching \u2026 They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she stopped posting her location in real time. She stripped her social media feed of lavish gifts and vanished from Paris for years. Other stars followed suit. Privacy became luxury.",
      "Defense attorneys have asked the court for leniency, citing the defendants\u2019 age and health. But prosecutors insist that criminal experience, not frailty, defined the gang.",
      "Even by the standards of France\u2019s famously deliberate legal system, the case took years to reach trial.",
      "Kardashian, who once said that the experience \u201creally changed everything,\u201d now waits for a verdict \u2014 and perhaps, a final measure of closure.",

      "Groundbreaking music executive Dave Shapiro has died in a San Diego plane crash",
      "Dave Shapiro, a groundbreaking music executive in the heavy metal and hard rock scene, has died in a San Diego plane crash. He was 42.",
      "Shapiro had a pilot\u2019s license and was listed as the owner of the plane that crashed, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The music agency Sound Talent Group confirmed Shapiro died in the Thursday morning crash along with two employees.",
      "\"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Shapiro cofounded Sound Talent Group in 2018 with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen. The agency\u2019s roster focuses on alternative bands across pop-punk, metalcore, post-hardcore and other popular hard rock subgenres. Clients have included Hanson, Pierce The Veil, Parkway Drive, Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton.",
      "Shapiro was a strong advocate for independent musicians and a co-founder of the National Independent Talent Organization. He was included in Billboard's 2012 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list recognizing rising stars in entertainment. Industry veterans say Shapiro paved the way for the formation of other independent agencies and helped many alternative bands find audiences in the mainstream.",
      "\u201cFinding something you love to do is only going to make you do a better job because you actually care. You\u2019re not just showing up for the paycheck, it\u2019s not a 9-to-5,\u201d he said in a music industry podcast in 2021. \u201cThis is part of living your life if you really love it.\u201d",
      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",
      "In high school, he started a band with his friends and got signed with Victory Records right when they graduated. They toured for a few years, during which he made connections in the music industry that would help his foray into the business side.",
      "Shapiro said he became instantly hooked on aviation after taking his first intro flight at age 22. He seemed to love music and flying with equal passion, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego.",
      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",
      "Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records.",
      "He offered flights in both San Diego and Homer, Alaska, where he and his wife, Julia Pawlik Shapiro, owned a home, according to his online posts.",
      "Shapiro married his wife in 2016 in the small town of Talkeetna, Alaska. They picked up their wedding licenses, got on a plane and flew to a glacier inside Denali National Park, landing with skis strapped to the plane\u2019s wheels.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Dave, we became instantly bonded over the unconventional lifestyles we lead and our constant need for adventure,\u201d she wrote in a blog post.",
      "In 2019, he posted on Instagram that he had obtained his airline transport pilot rating, the highest level of certification issued by the U.S.",
      "\u201cAlthough I have a career and don\u2019t plan to change that I always want to learn more and be a better pilot,' he wrote. He was also an adrenaline junkie who enjoyed base-jumping.",
      "Tributes poured in Thursday from musicians and others in the industry who called him warm, genuine and someone who helped little-known bands put their names on the map.",
      "\u201cHe would listen to any band you put in front of him to give them a chance,\u201d said Dayna Ghiraldi-Travers, founder of public relations agency Big Picture Media, who worked with Shapiro for over 15 years.",
      "Nate Blasdell, former lead guitarist for the band I Set My Friends on Fire, said he was \u201cabsolutely heartbroken.\"",
      "\u201cDave was the first booking agent I ever worked with and he was a major part of my music career in my late teen years,\u201d he said in a post on the social platform X. \u201cHe was truly the best in the game and one of the most respected people in the industry.\u201d",
      "Sum 41 singer Deryck Whibley credits Shapiro to helping build the rock band back up during a \u201clow point\u201d in their career.",
      "\u201cHis opinion mattered so much to me,\u201d Whibley said. \u201cHe was that guy I would go to for advice on things.\u201d",
      "During their last conversation, Shapiro had flown out in his new plane to see Sum 41's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in March. He promised Whibley to be back.",
      "\u201cMe and my wife, we\u2019re going to fly to you,\" Whibley said Shapiro said to him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pick you up and we\u2019re going to go somewhere crazy for lunch.\u201d",

      "A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he has demanded a second opinion at a court hearing",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he demanded a second opinion at a Thursday court hearing.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle a 48-year-old from Mississippi, appeared while in custody behind glass at a Hollywood courthouse that specializes in mental health cases. He had a long, gray beard and wore a thick, blue smock that jails use for suicide prevention.",
      "A county-appointed psychiatrist who evaluated Carwyle found the defendant incompetent, Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge as he stood near his client with glass separating them. But Krauss said Carwyle, as is his right, would like an evaluation from a different psychiatrist.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Maria Cavaluzzi ordered the reevaluation and set another hearing for May 29.",
      "Krauss declined comment outside court, as did the prosecutor handling the case and an attorney observing the hearing on behalf of Aniston.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism at his first court appearance, where a judge paused the criminal proceedings so he could undergo the psychological evaluation.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted, he could get up to three years in prison. If Carwyle is found incompetent again, the judge could order him to be sent to a state mental hospital for treatment and ongoing evaluation.",
      "Other than asking for the protective order for Aniston, prosecutors have not given their position on Carwyle's competency status, and did not speak at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Aniston became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

    "story": [
      "Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hasn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years",
      "CANNES, France -- Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hadn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "These and other films of Panahi\u2019s premiered to considerable acclaim at international film festivals where the director\u2019s conspicuous absence was sometimes noted by an empty chair. When his last film, 2022\u2019s \u201cNo Bears,\u201d debuted, he was in jail. Only after his hunger strike made worldwide news was Panahi \u2014 who had gone to Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison to inquire about his friend, the then-jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof \u2014 released, in early 2023.",
      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he nods, \u201cat least.\u201d",

      "The music agency Sound Talent Group says three of its employees died on the private plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood on Thursday",
      "SAN DIEGO -- A private jet carrying a music talent agent and five others hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, slamming into a home and killing multiple people on the flight.",
      "With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "No one in the neighborhood died, but eight were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries that were not life-threatening, including a person who was hurt climbing out a window, police officer Anthony Carrasco said.",
      "Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Shapiro also owned Velocity Records.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities were still combing the scene and recovering the bodies before releasing an official number and identifying the dead, though there were not believed to be any survivors aboard the flight.",
      "Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page.",
      "\u201cNo words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,\u201d the band wrote.",
      "A representative for the band referred to their social post when asked about Williams\u2019 death.",
      "Parts of Shapiro\u2019s 1985 Cessna 550 Citation littered a large area, including fragments under the power lines and a section of wing on a road behind the homes, said Elliot Simpson of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said.",
      "Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them.",
      "\u201cMy wife was screaming, and she\u2019s like, 'There's a fire,'\u201d McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.",
      "When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.",
      "The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned.",
      "\u201cIt put my truck into our living room,\u201d McCarty said.",
      "Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed, because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.",
      "\u201cWe have jet fuel all over the place,\u201d Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said.",
      "Eddy added that the fog was so thick in the morning that \u201cyou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "The flight took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego, according to Simpson.",
      "Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said.",

      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering day in early 1952 in Algiers",
      "PARIS -- Decades before transgender became a household word and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d became a worldwide hit \u2014 before visibility brought rights and recognition \u2014 there was Bambi, the Parisian icon who danced for Hollywood.",
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering summer day in early 1950s Algeria. An effeminate teenage boy named Jean-Pierre Pruvot stood mesmerized as traffic halted and crowds swarmed around a scandalous spectacle unfolding in the conservative Algiers streets.",
      "All had stopped to look at Coccinelle, the flamboyant \u201ctransvestite\u201d star of Paris\u2019 legendary cabaret, the Carrousel de Paris, who strutted defiantly down the boulevard, impeccably dressed as a woman, sparking awe and outrage and literally stopping traffic.",
      "What Pruvot \u2014 who would become famous under the female stage name \u201cBambi\u201d and Coccinelle\u2019s best friend \u2014 witnessed was more than mere performance. It was an act of resistance from the ashes of the Nazi persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that (identity) existed,\u201d Bambi told The Associated Press in a rare interview. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Carrousel troupe in the late 1940s emerged as a glamorous, audacious resistance. Bambi soon joined Coccinelle, April Ashley, and Capucine in Paris to revive queer visibility in Europe for the first time since the Nazis had violently destroyed Berlin\u2019s thriving queer scene of the 1930s.",
      "The Nazis branded gay men with pink triangles, deported and murdered thousands, erasing queer culture overnight. Just a few years after the war, Carrousel performers strode onto the global stage, a glittering frontline against lingering prejudice.",
      "Remarkably, audiences at the Carrousel knew exactly who these performers were \u2014 women who, as Bambi puts it, \u201cwould bare all.\u201d",
      "Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, \u00c9dith Piaf, Maria Callas and Marlene Dietrich all flocked to the cabaret, drawn to the allure of performers labeled \u201ctravestis.\u201d The stars sought out the Carrousel to flirt with postwar Paris\u2019s wild side. It was an intoxicating contradiction: cross-dressing was criminalized, yet the venue was packed with celebrities.",
      "The history of queer liberation shifted in this cabaret, one sequin at a time. The contrast was chilling: as Bambi arrived in Paris and found fame dancing naked for film stars, across the English Channel in early 1950s Britain the code-breaking genius Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay, leading to his suicide.",
      "Today, Marie-Pierre Pruvot \u2014 as she is also known \u2014 lives alone in an unassuming apartment in northeastern Paris. Her bookshelves spill over with volumes of literature and philosophy. A black feather boa, a lone whisper from her glamorous past, hangs loosely over a chair.",
      "At nearly 90, Bambi is the last of a dying generation. She outlived all her Carrousel sisters \u2014 April Ashley, Capucine, and Coccinelle.",
      "And though the spotlight faded, the legacy still shimmers.",
      "In her heyday, Bambi wasn\u2019t just part of the show; she was the show \u2014 with expressive almond-shaped eyes, pear-shaped face, and beauty indistinguishable from any desired Parisienne. Yet one key difference set her apart \u2014 a difference criminalized by French law.",
      "The depth of her history only becomes apparent as she points to striking and glamorous photographs and recounts evenings spent with legends.",
      "Such was their then-fame that the name of Bambi\u2019s housemate, Coccinelle, became slang for \"trans\" in Israel \u2014 often cruelly.",
      "Once Dietrich, the starry queer icon, arrived at the tiny Madame Arthur cabaret alongside Jean Marais, the actor and Jean Cocteau 's gay lover. \u201cIt was packed,\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cJean Marais instantly said, \u2018Sit (me and Marlene) on stage' And so they were seated onstage, legs crossed, champagne by their side, watching us perform.\u201d",
      "Another day, Dietrich swept in to a hair salon.",
      "\u201cMarlene always had this distant, untouchable air \u2014 except when late for the hairdresser,\u201d Bambi says, smiling. \u201cShe rushed in, kissed the hairdresser, settled beneath the dryer, stretched her long legs imperiously onto a stool, and lit a cigarette. Her gaunt pout as she smoked \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says, her impression exaggerated as she sucked in her cheeks. Perhaps Dietrich wasn\u2019t her favorite star.",
      "Then there was Piaf, who, one evening, teasingly joked about her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the French singing legend Charles Aznavour, performing nearby. \u201cShe asked, \u2018What time does Aznavour start?\u2019\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Midnight.\u2019 So she joked, \u2018Then it\u2019ll be finished by five past midnight.\u2019\"",
      "Behind the glamour lay constant danger. Living openly as a woman was illegal. \u201cThere was a police decree,\u201d Bambi recalls. \u201cIt was a criminal offense for a man to dress as a woman. But if you wore pants and flat shoes, you weren\u2019t considered dressed as a woman.\u201d",
      "The injustice was global. Homosexuality remained criminalized for decades: in Britain until 1967, in parts of the U.S. until 2003. Progress came slowly.",
      "In 1950s Paris, though, Bambi bought hormones casually over-the-counter, \u201clike salt and pepper at the grocery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was much freer then,\u201d but stakes were high, she said.",
      "Sisters were jailed, raped, driven into sex work. One comrade died after botched gender reassignment surgery in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cThere was only Casablanca,\u201d she emphasized, with one doctor performing the high-risk surgeries. Bambi waited cautiously until her best friends, Coccinelle and April Ashley, had safely undergone procedures from the late 50s before doing the same herself.",
      "Each night required extraordinary courage. Post-war Paris was scarred, haunted. The Carrousel wasn\u2019t mere entertainment \u2014 but a one-fingered salute to the past in heels and eyeliner.",
      "\u201cThere was this after-the-war feeling \u2014 people wanted to have fun,\u201d Bambi recalled. With no television, the cabarets were packed every night. \u201cYou could feel it \u2014 people demanded to laugh, to enjoy themselves, to be happy. They wanted to live again \u2026 to forget the miseries of the war.\u201d",
      "In 1974, sensing a shift, Bambi quietly stepped away from celebrity, unwilling to become \u201can aging showgirl.\u201d Swiftly obtaining legal female identity in Algeria, she became a respected teacher and Sorbonne scholar, hiding her dazzling past beneath Marcel Proust and careful anonymity for decades.",
      "Despite what she\u2019s witnessed, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019s remarkably skeptical about recent controversies around gender. This transgender pioneer feels wokeism has moved too quickly, fueling a backlash.",
      "She sees U.S. President Donald Trump as part of \u201ca global reaction against wokeism\u2026 families aren\u2019t ready\u2026 we need to pause and breathe a little before moving forward again.\u201d",
      "Inclusive pronouns and language \u201ccomplicate the language,\u201d she insists. Asked about author J.K. Rowling\u2019s anti-trans stance, her response is calmly dismissive: \u201cHer opinion counts no more than a baker\u2019s or a cleaning lady\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Bambi still stands \u2014 proud, elegant, unbowed \u2014 in a life spanning World War II to \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d",
      "When she first stepped onstage, the world had no words for someone like her. So she danced anyway. Today, the words exist. So do the rights. And the movements she helped inspire.",
      "\u201cI never wore a mask,\u201d she says softly, but firmly. \u201cExcept when I was a boy.\u201d",

      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 41-year-old Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi.",
      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation. In 2022, his album \u201cEntergalactic\u201d was released alongside a Netflix adult-animated romantic comedy of the same name, which he told The Associated Press allowed him to \u201cexplore the abstract.\u201d",
      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",
      "In response, she said he lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country in 2012, Combs told her that Cudi\u2019s car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi\u2019s friends there to see it, Cassie testified.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie\u2019s mother, Regina Ventura, testified that Cassie told her Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother\u2019s Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and she broke up with him, fearing for both of their safety.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",

      "The NFL revamped its rules last year around \u201cHard Knocks\u201d appearances, previously allowing teams that made the playoffs within the previous two seasons to decline to participate. Such an opt-out is no longer an option. Teams now ineligible for selection include those with a first-year head coach, those that have appeared on the training camp version of the show in the past eight seasons, and those picked for the in-season version focusing on one division.",
      "The Chicago Bears were a first-time \u201cHard Knocks\u201d participant last season during training camp. HBO and co-producer NFL Films last year added the in-season show, filming around the four AFC North teams, and an offseason version that premiered \u2014 and perhaps ended \u2014 with a focus on the Giants.",
      "The awkward goodbye between running back Saquon Barkley and general manager Joe Schoen was a prominent part of that series, which has so far not been renewed.",
      "Barkley, who signed with the rival Eagles and went on to win the Super Bowl, later complained that his side of the conversation with Schoen was recorded and aired without his consent.",
      "Schoen's informing Barkley that the Giants would not make him a contract offer or put the franchise tag on him and thus let him become a free agent became a must-see scene, along with a pained reaction from owner John Mara about losing a popular player.",

      "ATLANTA -- The rapper known as Rod Wave faces more than a dozen charges, some involving a gun, after he turned himself in to sheriff's officials in Georgia on Tuesday.",
      "Wave, whose real name is Rodarius Green, voluntarily surrendered to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office on warrants stemming from an April 21 police call in the Atlanta suburb of Milton, police there said.",
      "A police report obtained by the AP describes officers finding luxury cars with bullet holes in them and signs of a break-in at the home in one of Georgia's most exclusive communities last month. But it does not explain why authorities are now accusing the rapper of several crimes.",
      "\u201cThere is no truth to these charges,\u201d the rapper\u2019s lawyers Drew Findling and Marissa Goldberg said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cRod Green was a victim of a burglary and committed no crimes,\" they said. \"How he was even charged as a result of this situation is incomprehensible. This will absolutely be resolved favorably to Mr. Green.\u201d",
      "On April 21, Milton police responded to a home in the town north of Atlanta after a 911 report described \u201ca possible domestic disturbance,\u201d police said in a statement. A neighbor had heard yelling and screaming, and saw a woman crying, officers wrote in their initial report.",
      "Officers determined that the call was related to a previously unreported burglary and the discharge of a firearm at the location, police said. They later obtained arrest warrants for Green, who lived there.",
      "The charges include aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit a felony, criminal damage to property and pointing or aiming a gun at someone, Fulton County Jail records show. He's also accused of tampering with evidence \u2014 a felony \u2014 and obstruction of law officers.",
      "An initial police report obtained by the AP describes what officers found at the home when they arrived April 21. A gold Mercedes SUV had multiple bullet holes in it, and a black Rolls-Royce vehicle had a single bullet hole, the report said.",
      "\u201cIn the basement, we found a large safe that had been dragged across the floor, opened, and emptied,\u201d an officer wrote.",
      "Green's girlfriend told officers that she had returned home and found that the house appeared to have been burglarized. In the back of the home near the swimming pool, officers found a broken window and a hammer in a bush next to it. A black Glock handgun was also found at the scene, officers wrote.",
      "The initial report does not list any suspects who might have broken in, emptied the safe or shot the vehicles, nor does it accuse Green of committing any crimes.",
      "Green was released on bond shortly after turning himself in on the same day, Tuesday, authorities said.",
      "The 26-year-old Florida rapper is celebrated for his soul-trap sound, a unique melding of R&B and rap that has earned him 11 singles certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Four of his six albums hit No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s top R&B/hip-hop albums chart, including his most recent, 2024\u2019s \u201cLast Lap.\u201d",
      "This year, he contributed the sing-song title track rap \u201cSinners\u201d to Ryan Coogler\u2019s record-breaking, critically acclaimed blockbuster of the same name.",
      "Green grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida, where he has had at least one past scrape with the law before a domestic battery charge was dismissed in 2022.",
      "An ex-girlfriend had accused Green of entering her home in the Orlando area and choking her while their two children were in another room, according to an arrest warrant. The two had dated for about four years, and the girlfriend told investigators that Green accused her of seeing other men while they were broken up.",
      "Prosecutors later told court officials that the case was not suitable for prosecution.",

      "This lighthearted, globe-trotting heist from Guy Ritchie, debuting on AppleTV+ on Friday, stars Natalie Portman and John Krasinski as estranged siblings attempting to piece together historical facts in hopes of finding the mythical spring. The quest takes them to far-flung places from Vienna to the pyramids, as they try to evade capture by the authorities and a shadowy operation intent on stopping the search.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",
      "Her character, Charlotte, is an art historian who had an adventuresome childhood with her explorer father and brother Luke (Krasinski) but has since settled for a more stable life. We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",
      "The medication controls the infection and allows many to have an average life expectancy. Without it, the virus attacks a person\u2019s immune system, and they develop AIDS, the late stage of an HIV infection.",
      "Reaction is swift when Dr. Maklin tells his patients that in two months, the hospital won\u2019t have any HIV medication left.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep living.\u201d",

      "Winning titles is fun, too.",
      "The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics.",
      "\"That would be the dream, and I\u2019d love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,\u201d Rizvi said.",
      "The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.",
      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",
      "\u201cYou really need to anticipate after you\u2019ve heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,\u201d he said. \"You obviously can\u2019t see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it\u2019s a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.",
      "Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. He was hooked right away.",
      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood \u2014 his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian \u2014 in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.",

      "The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be \u201cwidely and regularly practiced\u201d in at least 32 countries and three continents.",

I\u2019d love for blind tennis to be there as well because it\u2019s definitely got the potential.",

      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Thursday to unravel several laws regulating abortion in the state.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by two providers in the state and the Arizona Medical Association. It comes more than six months after voters enshrined in the state constitution access to abortions up to fetal viability, which is the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.",
      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",
      "\u201cThese stigmatizing and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions violate the right to reproductive freedom established by Arizona voters last November, and it\u2019s time for them to go,\u201d Rebecca Chan, staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cArizonans are perfectly capable of making decisions about their own reproductive futures.\"",
      "The state attorney general's office is reviewing the complaint, and an agency spokesperson noted that state law should be in line with the amendment approved by voters last November. Arizona was one of a handful of states that passed ballot measures in the 2024 general election enshrining the right to abortion to their state constitutions.",
      "Earlier this year, an Arizona judge blocked the state's 15-week abortion ban.",

      "Supporters of the bill say the moves will save money, root out waste and encourage personal responsibility.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "The measure, which also includes tax cuts, passed the House by one vote and could have provisions reworked again as it heads to the Senate.",

      "That could spell trouble for rural hospitals, in particular, who will see their small pool of patients go from paying for their emergency care with Medicaid coverage to not paying anything at all. Hospitals could have to eat their costs.",
      "\u201cAdding work requirements is not just a policy change, it\u2019s a shift away from the purpose of the program,\u201d Conrado said of the rule.",
      "Only Arkansas has had a work requirement that kicks people off for noncompliance. More than 18,000 lost coverage after it kicked in in 2018, and the programs was later blocked by federal courts.",
      "Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said work requirements do not result in more people having jobs \u2014 but in fewer people having health insurance.",

      "The legislation passed by the House would raise the work requirement to age 65 and also extend it to parents without children younger than age 7. The bill also would limit the ability to waive work requirements in areas with unemployment rates significantly above the national average.",
      "The combination of those changes could put 6 million adults at risk of losing SNAP benefits, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",

      "Under the bill, the federal government would punish states that use their own state dollars to provide Medicaid-covered services to immigrants lacking legal status or to provide subsidies to help them buy health insurance.",
      "Some states that provide that sort of coverage extend it only to children.",
      "Those states would see federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population \u2014 typically low-income adults \u2014 drop from 90% to 80%.",
      "That could mean states pull back that Medicaid coverage to avoid the federal penalty.",
      "\u201cIf that penalty of 10% is imposed, we would expect that states will have to drop that coverage,\u201d said Georgetown's Alker.",

      "The group said about 200 centers are at risk \u2014 most of them in states where abortion is legal. In those states, the number of Planned Parenthood centers could be cut in half.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

      "Last month, a group of 79 Republicans \u2014 including several senators who represent farming states \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the report saying in a letter to Kennedy that without the products agricultural \u201cyields and quantity are negatively impacted.\u201d",
      "Glyphosate has been available for about 50 years and some farmers say it remains essential for controlling weeds without excessive tilling, helping to conserve both soil and fuel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use: It works,\u201d said Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer who is past president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.",
      "Kennedy, though, has built a sizable following over many decades, in part, because of the lawsuits he's waged against corporations, including the company that produced weedkiller Roundup. The World Health Organization has labeled that product's key ingredient, glyphosate, as a probable carcinogen for humans.",
      "On Wednesday a large group of his supporters sent Kennedy a letter calling on the commission to \u201chold the chemical industry\u201d accountable in the report, noting that pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cEvidence is piling up and the risks from pesticide exposure are undeniable,\u201d the letter, signed by 360 self-proclaimed MAHA supporters that include farmers, former Kennedy campaign staffers and those who worked with him at his anti-vaccine nonprofit.",
      "Dave Murphy, a fundraiser for Kennedy's failed presidential bid, said that he submitted studies and comments on pesticides to Trump administration officials for inclusion in the MAHA report but said that there's \u201ca lot of pressure within Washington\u201d over what the final report says on the issue.",
      "During a senate hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy rebutted concerns from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that the report would \u201cunfairly\u201d target farmers.",
      "\u201cThere's not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said of his report. \u201cWe are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\u201d",
      "Kennedy was appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss the White House's proposed budget, which would give a $500 million boost for Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. That same proposal also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and medical research programs.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Make America Healthy Again Commission tasked with examining the \u201cthreat\u201d that prescription drugs, chemicals and certain food ingredients pose to children.",
      "That review was supposed to be led by several members of the president's cabinet, including Kennedy, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy, who has pledged \u201cradical transparency\u201d since taking over the nation's health department, never convened a public meeting of the commission. The White House only released brief, edited clips from a single, closed-door meeting of the commission held in March.",
      "A White House spokesman called the report, which has not been released, a \u201chistoric step,\u201d without sharing further details.",

      "A person attended a Shakira concert at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey while infectious with measles",
      "New Jersey health officials are asking people who went to last week's Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium to monitor for measles symptoms because a person went to see the singer while infectious.",
      "There is no confirmed outbreak in New Jersey, but the U.S. and North America are seeing high measles activity this year \u2014 including hundreds sickened by the highly infectious airborne virus in West Texas \u2014 and declining rates of people getting the vaccine, which is 97% effective after two doses.",
      "Schools and daycares are among the most common places for measles exposures, like one that happened in three western North Dakota public schools in early May that led to all unvaccinated students being held at home for 21 days under state law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the measles and how to protect yourself.",
      "Most U.S. children get vaccinated against measles before entering public school, but increasing numbers of people skipping shots for religious or personal reasons have fueled outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad this year.",
      "Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",
      "The CDC, didn't break out chair yoga for analysis but recommends that adults 65 and older focus on activities that improve balance and strength. That, the health agency said, can be achieved through various exercises, including chair yoga.",
      "Chapman and her students have thoughts on why more men don\u2019t practice yoga. Traditionally, Chapman said, the practice was reserved for men, but as yoga became more westernized, women took over.",
      "\u201cWomen tend to be more group-oriented. I would love to see more men in class. I do have a few. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re intimidated, but you know, it\u2019s a great way to meet women if everybody\u2019s single,\u201d Chapman said with a chuckle.",
      "Luria theorizes that fewer men are drawn to yoga because it's not a competitive sport.",
      "\u201cYou're really working at your own level,\u201d she said. \u201cTake out the competition and it's not their thing.\u201d",
      "These chair yoga practitioners have lots of advice. Rivman summed it up best: \u201cGet into a chair and do some yoga. You don't have to stand on your head, but you have to move. You're never too old to start.\"",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",

      "It recently emerged Nawrocki took part in a 2009 Gdansk hooligan brawl involving about 140 rival football fans, some later convicted of crimes. Nawrocki described the fight as a form of \u201cnoble\" combat.",
      "His behavior during a presidential debate on Friday also generated a lot of discussion. At one point during the debate, while Trzaskowski spoke about plans for senior care, Nawrocki covered his mouth with one hand and put something in his mouth. He first said it was gum, but later said it was a nicotine pouch.",
      "His critics say all of these things make him unfit to represent Poland as the head of state. His supporters dismiss the allegations as politically motivated, and it is not clear if any of the allegations will hurt him.",
      "Trzaskowski, 53, is Warsaw\u2019s mayor and a close ally of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. A deputy leader of the pro-EU Civic Platform, he has been prominent in national politics for years. This is his second presidential bid after narrowly losing to Duda in 2020.",
      "Supporters credit him with modernizing Warsaw through infrastructure, public transit expansion and cultural investments. He is widely seen as pro-European, pragmatic and focused on aligning Poland more closely with EU norms, especially on democratic governance and judicial independence.",
      "Fluent in several foreign languages including English and French, he is praised by supporters but mocked by opponents, who see those skills as a sign of elitism and taunt him with the nickname \u201cBonjour\u201d at right-wing rallies.",
      "His right-wing critics accusing him of being willing to sell out Poland's sovereignty to the EU and embracing green economic policies, which they believe are harmful to Poland's traditional reliance on coal as an energy source.",
      "His open support for LGBTQ+ rights, including appearances at Pride parades, has made him a polarizing figure in conservative and rural areas. His conservative critics feel he is out of touch with traditional Polish values and say his administration has mismanaged aspects of Warsaw\u2019s real estate and budget.",
      "Voter fatigue is another challenge. Some centrist and progressive voters have expressed disappointment with the Tusk government\u2019s failure to deliver on key promises, particularly on easing Poland\u2019s near-total abortion ban.",
      "Trzaskowski has sought to reinvigorate that base, leading a major Warsaw rally on Sunday that aimed to mobilize voters.",
      "He has framed the election as a choice between a European future and authoritarian nationalism. His campaign stresses democratic institutions, EU cooperation and women\u2019s rights, messages that resonate more in cities than in rural areas.",

      "The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views.",
      "Sales of Tesla vehicles in 32 European countries tumbled 49% to 7,261 in April from 14,228 in the same month the previous year, according to the figures released by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA.",
      "At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%. Meanwhile, sales of gasoline and diesel powered cars slumped.",
      "The figures, which cover the European Union's 27 member countries and five other nations outside the bloc, back up early data from Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark released at the start of this month that had pointed to a sales collapse.",
      "Tesla has been reeling from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics, but it also faces other factors including an aging model lineup and intensifying competition from rival electric vehicle brands, particularly from China.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war has also turned Europeans off buying American brands. In recent days, Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods, accusing the bloc of being \u201cvery difficult to deal with,\" before agreeing to delay the duties until July.",
      "In one sign that Tesla appears to be losing ground to cut-price Chinese brands, sales at China's SAIC zoomed up 54% in April, according to the ACEA figures. SAIC owns a slew of auto brands including U.K.-based MG, known for its low-cost EV models.",
      "Tesla is also suffering because it had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply.",
      "For the first four months of the year, Tesla's European sales fell roughly 39% to 61,320 while the continent's auto market as a while showed little change during the same period, according to the data.",
      "For April, car sales in the EU edged up 1.3% from the previous year, \u201cshowing signs of recovery despite the ongoing unpredictable global economic environment,\u201d the group said in a press release.",

      "\u201cWhen one of us is under attack, the rest of us must come to that person\u2019s defense,\u201d he added. \u201cThe globalists intend to take each one of us out one by one \u2014 to shame us, to silence us, to bankrupt us, to ruin us, to make our kids turn against us.\"",

The meetings, which started in 1974, used to champion tight budgets and a hawkish foreign policy, but have steadily been taken over by the Trump wing of the Republican party.

CPAC has held gatherings in Japan, South Korea, Mexico City and Israel.

The gathering in Poland follows multiple CPAC meetings in Budapest.",

      "\u201cThe government is strongly committed to support mountaineering in every possible way by keeping climbers safe, by protecting the natural beauty of our peaks and by helping local communities grow alongside the spirit of adventure,\u201d Nepal\u2019s tourism minister Badri Prasad Pandey said.",
      "He was speaking in Kathmandu at a gathering of about 100 climbers from around the world who have successfully tackled Mount Everest. The one-day conference, dubbed the Everest Summiteers Summit, involved discussions on how to protect climbers and the environment.",
      "Attendees expressed concern on the rising numbers of people who crowd Everest to try to scale the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak. Veterans have complained how the mountain is becoming crowded and dirty.",

      "Nepal doesn\u2019t have rules on how many days climbers must spend acclimatizing or making practice climbs. The permits to climb Everest, which cost $11,000 each, are valid for 90 days.

      "\u201cThe biggest issue and concern at the moment is overcrowding,\u201d said Adriana Brownlee, the youngest woman to climb the world's 14 highest peaks. \u201cWe need to make sure that those (people on the mountain) are all experienced in the mountaineering world. So that if they are struggling (or) they are on their own and something happens, they know how to save themselves.\u201d",
      "Nepalese climber Purnima Shrestha said attempts to climb Mount Everest has become too commercialized.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, is voting Tuesday on a bill to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "Tuesday's vote, expected in the late afternoon, is a key legislative step on the contentious and long-debated issue. If approved by a majority of lawmakers, the bill will be sent to the Senate for further debate.",
      "The proposed measure defines assisted dying as allowing people to use a lethal substance under certain conditions so that they may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",

      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",

      "The debate in France comes as similar talks are ongoing in the U.K., where lawmakers are debating a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales after giving it initial approval in November.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication that has been prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "Assisted suicide is allowed in Switzerland and several U.S. states. Euthanasia is currently legal in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Belgium and Luxembourg under certain conditions.",

      "Putin said a year ago that a Russian offensive at the time aimed to create a buffer zone in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region. That could have helped protect Russia\u2019s Belgorod border region, where frequent Ukrainian attacks have embarrassed the Kremlin.",

      "Migrants from the Middle East, Africa or Asia often face dangers on their long journeys and abuse in the hands of people-smuggling gangs who often clash for control or with the authorities.",

      "QUETTA, Pakistan -- Gunmen shot and killed a policeman assigned to protect polio workers in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday before fleeing the scene, police and officials said.",
      "The attack occurred in Noshki, a district in Balochistan province, local police official Mohammad Hassan said, adding that the polio workers escaped unharmed in the attack.",
      "The female health workers were administering oral polio vaccine drops to children inside a house when the assailants opened fire on the police officer, Abdul Waheed, who died on the way to the hospital, Hassan said.",

      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in separate statements denounced the assault and vowed stern action against those behind the attack, which came a day after Pakistan launched the nationwide campaign to vaccinate 45 million children from polio.",
      "Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where the spread of the wild polio virus hasn\u2019t been stopped, according to the World Health Organization. There are ongoing outbreaks of polio linked to the oral vaccine in 10 other countries, mostly in Africa.",
      "Since January, Pakistan has reported 10 polio cases from various parts of the country despite the launch of immunization drives. Last year, the South Asian country witnessed a surge in polio cases, which jumped to 74, though it reported only one polio case in 2021.",
      "Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks.",

      "She had the lowest vote count of the six newly elected senators for the state. The Australian Electoral Commission officially declared the poll Tuesday.",
      "The new job will be a \u201cbig adjustment,\" said Walker, who starts her six-year term July 1. A federal lawmaker\u2019s base salary is more than 205,000 Australian dollars ($133,000) annually.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few feelings. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d Walker told Australian Broadcasting Corp. after the results were announced late Monday.",
      "\u201cI want to do a good job for South Australians, but I also want to show young people, particularly young women, that this is achievable and this is something that they can do also. I\u2019m also really excited. Not many people my age get to \u2026 go to Canberra and have the ability to contribute in the way that I will,\u201d she added.",

      "Australia's youngest-ever federal lawmaker was Wyatt Roy, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 at the age of 20. He lasted two three-year terms before he was voted out of his Queensland state seat.",
      "Large swings at elections as occurred May 3 typically bring a larger proportion of women into the Parliament in seats that their parties hadn\u2019t realistically expected to win. Often the newcomers lose their seats when votes swing back at the next election.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expects 57% of Labor lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives will be women when the new Parliament first sits on July 22. The proportion of women was 52% during Albanese\u2019s first term in government.",
      "Australian governments usually lose seats in their second term. Albanese leads the first federal government not to lose a single seat at an election since 1966. Labor is expected to hold 94 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, up from 78 in the last Parliament.",
      "Australian National University political historian Frank Bongiorno said unexpected swings can put women candidates into Parliament after seeking apparently unwinnable seats .",
      "But Bongiorno said Labor had been working on increasing women\u2019s representation since the party introduced a quota in 1994 that stated 35% of candidates in winnable seats had to be female.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we now have not 50%, but 57% is partly a function of obviously just the size of the swing, but it is also, I think, very deliberate changes that have occurred within the Labor Party over about 30 years from what was a very male-dominated culture and environment,\u201d Bongiorno said.",
      "The odds had been stacked against Walker being elected as her party's third choice in South Australia, Bongiorno said.",

    "story": [
      "Sao Paulo authorities are trying out a full-on approach to end the infamous Crackland area, which experts say could lead to the same results of previous initiatives; an initial success followed by a gradual return of drug users",
      "SAO PAULO -- Marcelo Colai\u00e1covo was driving to his bar in Downtown Sao Paulo on a recent May afternoon when he noticed something unusual: the hundreds of drug users that for years roamed around the neighborhood were all gone. He walked around for 10 minutes finding no trace of them. Also gone was the stench of their waste being cleaned by city hall staffers.",
      "\u201cI felt this strange peace,\u201d said the 42-year-old Sao Paulo resident. \u201cEveryone had disappeared. But how come?\u201d",
      "Colai\u00e1covo's bar-museum is located in one of the edges of Cracolandia, or Crackland, a sprawling downtown Sao Paulo area that for decades has been home to thousands of drug users, often lying on the ground or jaywalking with pipes between their lips.",
      "But by May 12 the scene had changed.",
      "Only police officers were seen where crack users dominated for decades. Shop owners and residents who worried about muggings were chatting outside. Pavement that until recently featured scattered shoes, single socks, broken pipes and, sometimes, feces seemed spotless. The makeshift shelters, made of cardboard and fabric, were gone, and some of the graffiti on deteriorated buildings of Crackland, once a backdrop to the human drama, can finally be seen.",
      "The transformation that stationed police officers in the area and scared residents into other parts of the city is the result of an aggressive local government initiative to change the region for good.",
      "Experts caution, however, that the cleanup carried significant costs: police brutality, the spread of security risks to other areas and the neglect of treatment and protection to drug users, who are not criminals. Instead, they say, Crackland residents have only scattered and will inevitably return.",
      "Residents told The Associated Press that police aggression has escalated since earlier this year under Gov. Tarcisio de Freitas and Mayor Ricardo Nunes. They say officers more frequently are using batons, preventing them from carrying bags where drugs could be hidden, closing several local pensions and even threatening to kill them. About a fourth of neighboring slum, where drug traffickers are reportedly based, has been removed.",
      "Nearly two weeks after drug users vanished from the main Crackland area, hundreds have been spotted in smaller pockets around Sao Paulo's old city center. Social media videos show some attempting to return at night to their former drug use spot, now a 24/7 police-protected area. But all attempts have failed.",
      "Many hope to soon return to the area they occupied for decades \u2014 provided police brutality wanes and authorities lose their grip of the region, as has happened in the past.",
      "\u201cMy guitar is in the mud because of a criminal wearing blue,\" said Rog\u00e9rio, a tearful man in a dirty shirt and yoga pants, who didn't provide his surname due to fear of retribution. \"I have nothing against the law. But the law has to understand we live there. Now we have to roam, it's horrible. We can't enter where we lived, we can\u2019t even carry a blanket.\u201d",
      "Crackland is located in what was once part of Sao Paulo\u2019s old city center. The decline of the region began in the 1960s, as business moved to Paulista Avenue, a more central artery, and industries relocated to the cheaper outskirts. For about two decades, until the mid 1980s, low budget film companies moved in, earning the region the nickname of \u201cGarbage Mouth.\u201d Drug users first arrived about three decades ago.",
      "Brazilian researchers say Crackland emerged in the 1990s due to a confluence of two factors: the proximity of a major transportation hub, encompassing buses, subways and trains, and widespread mass killings in the city\u2019s most impoverished districts, which forced residents to congregate in the downtown\u2019s most dilapidated sector.",
      "For much of the last 30 years, shop owners and residents feared being mugged. Today, the area the size of 10 soccer fields in Sao Paulo\u2019s old city center, is spotless and silent.",
      "Lieutenant Sao Paulo Gov. Felicio Ramuth, who was picked by Gov. de Freitas to clean up Crackland, said last week that there was no police brutality linked to the scattering of residents.",
      "\u201cWe had 50 police raids at the scene (and) 1,000 criminals were jailed,\u201d he told daily O Estado de S.Paulo on Wednesday. \u201cWe did not receive any accusation of police brutality.\u201d",
      "Ramuth said that 1,200 drug users who were in the area until a few weeks ago are now under treatment in clinics, but offered no evidence to support his claim. He added that he will deem Crackland free of drug users if its current condition remains for the next six months.",
      "Gov. De Freitas, a former minister under President Jair Bolsonaro, is reportedly considering running against President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in the 2026 presidential election. His rivals claim he stands to gain political capital by ending Crackland, which could also make way for a 5-billion Brazilian reais ($900 million) project to relocate about 60 state government buildings to the area.",
      "Critics of the government's strategy to end Crackland are crying foul. Catholic priest J\u00falio Lancelotti, who has worked with homeless people for most of his 76 years, said police brutality and the scattering of drug users will not solve the problem.",
      "\u201cIt is not right to make political propaganda to say Crackland disappeared,\" Lancelotti said. \"Crackland is not a physical area, it's about people. They are being taken to isolated regions, they are not going to clinics.\u201d",
      "The city hall of Guarulhos, a city within the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, expressed concern in a recent statement about the accusations by Lancelotti and other activists who claim that the residents of Crackland \u201chad been brought and abandoned\u201d there. It added it will investigate the case.",
      "Sao Paulo Mayor Nunes denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Giordano Magri, a University of Sao Paulo researcher specializing in urban issues, said the current crackdown on Crackland aims to remove the infrastructure for drug users to survive in the area, but they will eventually find similar conditions elsewhere.",
      "\u201cSince the governor and the mayor became more authoritarian, that ecosystem is gone. But they can't do this forever,\u201d said Magri, who added that people leaving Crackland will have more than 70 smaller spots across the city to relocate to.",
      "Rog\u00e9rio, the man whose guitar was broken, fears the situation could get worse in the coming days as hundreds seek to return.",
      "\u201cWe are real people. I say that with a sour heart. I am garbage, I know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that they are scattering the garbage, the problem will grow.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's first locally born giant pandas have finally been named and introduced as Jia Jia and De De.",
      "The names of the cubs, affectionately known as \u201cElder Sister\u201d and \u201cLittle Brother,\u201d were announced Tuesday in a ceremony at Ocean Park, the theme park housing them, their parents and two other giant pandas that arrived from mainland China last year.",
      "The names were the winning suggestions from residents in a naming contest that drew more than 35,700 entries.",
      "The Chinese character \u201cJia,\u201d from the female cub's name \u201cJia Jia,\u201d carries a message of support and features an element of family and a sense of auspicious grace. The name embodies the prosperity of families and the nation and the happiness of the people, the park said.",
      "The Chinese character \u201cDe,\" from the male cub's name, means to succeed, carrying the connotation that Hong Kong is successful in everything. De also has the same pronunciation as the Chinese character for virtue, the park said, suggesting giant pandas possess virtues cherished by Chinese people.",
      "Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said they followed tradition by using Mandarin pronunciation for the pandas\u2019 English names. He said \u201cJia\" sounds like a word in the Cantonese term for elder sister, while \u201cDe De\u201d sounds a bit like the Cantonese phrase for little brother. Cantonese is the mother language of many Hong Kongers.",
      "\u201cIt's a very positive pair of names,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be a bit creative here with the names.\u201d",
      "The cubs, who live with their mom, attracted crowds of visitors on Tuesday. Jia Jia explored a rock and walked around their area, while De De climbed a tree.",
      "Visitor Polly Luk, a panda lover with an annual pass to the park, spent an hour in line to see the cubs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so used to their old names. Even now they have new names, I'll still call them \u2018Elder Sister\u2019 and \u2018Little Brother\u2019,\" Luk said.",
      "The twins' birth in August made their mother, Ying Ying, the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mom. Their popularity among residents, visitors and on social media raised hopes for a tourism boost in the city, where politicians touted the commercial opportunities as the \u201cpanda economy.\u201d",
      "Observers are watching whether housing six pandas helps the park revive its business, especially when caring for the animals in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year.",
      "The park recorded a nearly 40% growth in visitor flow and 40% increase in overall income during a five-day holiday beginning May 1 in mainland China, said Pong, who hopes the growth momentum will continue through summer, Halloween and Christmas seasons.",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy.",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) \u2014 King Charles III will outline new Prime Minister Mark Carney's government priorities in a speech in the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday. It's widely viewed as a show of support in the face of annexation threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex Canada  prompted Prime Minister Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "Carney said in a statement the visit speaks to the \u201cvitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity.\u201d",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign, the last time in 1977.",

      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the United States. The king\u2019s visit clearly underscores Canada\u2019s sovereignty, he said.",

      "More than 200 Ukrainian POWs have died in Russian prisons since Moscow's full-scale invasion three years ago",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cEverything will be all right.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian soldier Serhii Hryhoriev said this so often during brief phone calls from the front that his wife and two daughters took it to heart. His younger daughter, Oksana, tattooed the phrase on her wrist as a talisman.",
      "Even after Hryhoriev was captured by the Russian army in 2022, his anxious family clung to the belief that he would ultimately be OK. After all, Russia is bound by international law to protect prisoners of war.",
      "When Hryhoriev finally came home, though, it was in a body bag.",
      "A Russian death certificate said the 59-year-old died of a stroke. But a Ukrainian autopsy and a former POW who was detained with him tell a different story about how he died \u2013 one of violence and medical neglect at the hands of his captors.",
      "Hryhoriev is one of more than 200 Ukrainian POWs who have died while imprisoned since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago. Abuse inside Russian prisons was likely a contributing factor in many of these deaths, according to officials from human rights groups, the U.N., the Ukrainian government and a Ukrainian medical examiner who has performed dozens of POW autopsies.",
      "The officials say the prison death toll adds to evidence that Russia is systematically brutalizing captured soldiers. They say forensic discrepancies like Hryhoriev's, and the repatriation of bodies that are mutilated and decomposed, point to an effort to cover up alleged torture, starvation and poor health care at dozens of prisons and detention centers across Russia and occupied Ukraine.",
      "Russian authorities did not respond to requests for comment. They have previously accused Ukraine of mistreating Russian POWs \u2014 allegations the U.N. has partially backed up, though it says Ukraine's violations are far less common and severe than what Russia is accused of.",
      "Hryhoriev joined the Ukrainian army in 2019 after he lost his job as an office worker at a high school. When the war began three years later, he was stationed with other soldiers in Mariupol, an industrial port city that was the site of a fierce battle \u2014 and far from his home in the central Poltava region.",
      "On April 10, 2022, Hryhoriev called his family to reassure them that \u201ceverything will be all right.\u201d That was the last time they ever spoke to him.",
      "Two days later, a relative of a soldier in Hryhoriev\u2019s unit called to say the men had been captured. After Mariupol fell to Russia, more than 2,000 soldiers defending the city became Russian prisoners.",
      "Soon his family got a call from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which confirmed he was alive and officially registered as a POW, guaranteeing his protection under the Geneva Conventions. \u201cWe were told: \u2018that means everything is fine \u2026 Russia has to return him,\u2019\u201d Hryhoriev\u2019s wife, Halyna, recalled.",
      "In August 2022, she received a letter from him, that addressed her by a nickname. \u201cMy dear Halochka,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am alive and well. Everything will be all right.\u201d",
      "Desperate for more information, his daughter Oksana, 31, scoured Russian social media accounts, where videos of Ukrainian POWs regularly appeared. Eventually, she saw him in one \u2014 looking gaunt and missing teeth. His gray hair was cropped very short, framing gentle features now partially covered by a beard.",
      "In the video, likely shot under duress, Hryhoriev said to the camera: \u201cI\u2019m alive and well.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut if you looked at him, you could see that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Oksana said.",
      "The truth was dismal, said Oleksii Honcharov, a 48-year-old Ukrainian POW who was detained with him.",
      "Honcharov lived in the same prison barracks as Hryhoriev starting in the fall of 2022. Over a period of months, he witnessed Hryhoriev absorb the same severe punishment as every other POW at the Kamensk-Shakhtinsky Correctional Colony in southwest Russia.",
      "\u201cEveryone got hit -- no exceptions,\u201d said Honcharov, who was repatriated to Ukraine in February as part of a prisoner swap. \u201cSome more, some less, but we all took it.\u201d",
      "Honcharov endured months of chest pain while in captivity. Even then, the beatings never stopped, he said, and sometimes they began after his pleas for medical care, which were ignored.",
      "\u201cToward the end, I could barely walk,\u201d said Honcharov, who was diagnosed with tuberculosis once back in Ukraine \u2013 an increasingly common ailment among returning POWs.",
      "A 2024 U.N. report found that 95% of released Ukrainian POWs had endured \u201csystematic\u201d torture. Prisoners described beatings, electric shocks, suffocation, sexual violence, prolonged stress positions, mock executions, and sleep deprivation.",
      "\u201cThis conduct could not be more unlawful,\u201d said Danielle Bell, the U.N.\u2019s top human rights monitor in Ukraine.",
      "The report also said some Russian POWs were mistreated by Ukrainian forces during their initial capture -- including beatings, threats and electric shocks. But the abuse stopped once Russian POWs were moved to official Ukrainian detention centers, the report said.",
      "Hryhoriev was physically strong and often outlasted younger prisoners during forced exercises, Honcharov recalled. But over time, he began showing signs of physical decline: dizziness, fatigue and, eventually, an inability to walk without help.",
      "Yet despite his worsening condition, prison officials provided only minimal health care, Honcharov said.",
      "In a bright, sterile room with the sour-sweet smell of human decomposition, Inna Padei performs autopsies on Ukrainian soldiers repatriated by Russia, as well as civilians exhumed from mass graves. Hundreds of bodies zipped up in black plastic bags have been delivered in refrigerated trucks to the morgue where she works in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.",
      "Those who died in battle are still wearing military fatigues and often have obvious external wounds. The bodies of former POWs are dressed in prison uniforms and are often mutilated and decomposed.",
      "It is the job of Padei and other forensic experts to piece together how soldiers like Hryhoriev died. These reports are often the only reliable information the soldiers\u2019 families get \u2014 and they will be used by Ukraine, along with testimony from former POWs, to bring war crimes charges against Russia at the International Criminal Court.",
      "The body of a former POW recently examined by Padei had an almond-sized fracture on the right side of its skull. That suggested the soldier was struck by a blunt object \u2013 a blow potentially strong enough to have killed him instantly, or shortly after, she said.",
      "\u201cThese injuries may not always be the direct cause of death,\u201d Padei said, \u201cbut they clearly indicate the use of force and torture against the servicemen.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Amnesty International documented widespread torture of Ukrainian POWs in Russia. Its report was especially critical of Russia's secrecy regarding the whereabouts and condition of POWs, saying it refused to grant rights groups or health workers access to its prisons, leaving families in the dark for months or years about their loved ones.",
      "Of the more than 5,000 POWs Russia has repatriated to Ukraine, at least 206 died in captivity, including more than 50 when an explosion ripped through a Russian-controlled prison barracks, according to the Ukrainian government. An additional 245 Ukrainian POWs were killed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield, according to Ukrainian prosecutors.",
      "The toll of dead POWs is expected to rise as more bodies are returned and identified, but forensic experts face significant challenges in determining causes of death.",
      "In some cases, internal organs are missing. Other times, it appears as if bruises or injuries have been hidden or removed.",
      "Ukrainian officials believe the mutilation of bodies is an effort by Russia to conceal the true causes of death. Extreme decomposition is another obstacle, officials say.",
      "\u201cThey hold the bodies until they reach a state where nothing can be determined,\u201d said Petro Yatsenko, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian government agency in charge of POW affairs.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the prompt exchange of POWs must be part of any ceasefire agreement, along with the return of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, including children forcibly deported to Russia. A major prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine took place over the weekend.",
      "The Associated Press interviewed relatives of 21 Ukrainian POWs who died in captivity. Autopsies performed in Ukraine found that five of these POWs died of heart failure, including soldiers who were 22, 39 and 43. Four others died from tuberculosis or pneumonia, and three others perished, respectively, from an infection, asphyxia and a blunt force head wound.",
      "Padei said cases like these \u2014 and others she has seen \u2014 are red flags, suggesting that physical abuse and untreated injuries and illness likely contributed to many soldiers' deaths.",
      "\u201cUnder normal or humane conditions, these would not have been fatal,\u201d Padei said.",
      "In one autopsy report, coroners said an individual had been electrocuted and beaten just days before dying of heart failure and extreme emaciation. Other autopsies noted that bodies showed signs of gangrene or untreated infections.",
      "\u201cEverything the returned prisoners describe \u2026 we see the same on the bodies,\u201d Padei said.",
      "Months into Hryhoriev\u2019s detention at the Kamensk-Shakhtinsky prison \u2013 and after his daughter saw him in the Russian army\u2019s social media video -- his health deteriorated significantly, according to Honcharov.",
      "But instead of being sent to a hospital, Hryhoriev was moved to a tiny cell that was isolated from other prisoners. Another Ukrainian captive, a paramedic, was assigned to stay with him.",
      "\u201cIt was damp, cold, with no lighting at all,\u201d recalled Honcharov.",
      "He died in that cell about a month later, Honcharov said. It was May 20, 2023, according to his Russian death certificate.",
      "The Hryhoriev family didn't learn he had died until more than six months later, when a former POW reached out. Then, in March 2024, police in central Ukraine called: A body had arrived with a Russian death certificate bearing Hryhoriev\u2019s name. A DNA test confirmed it was him.",
      "An autopsy performed in Ukraine disputed Russia\u2019s claim that Hryhoriev died of a stroke. It said he bled to death after blunt trauma to his abdomen that also damaged his spleen.",
      "Hryhoriev\u2019s body was handed over to the family last June, and soon after he was buried in his hometown of Pyriatyn.",
      "To honor him, Hryhoriev\u2019s wife and older daughter, Yana, followed Oksana's lead and tattooed their wrists with the optimistic expression he had drilled into them.",
      "\u201cNow we have an angel in the sky watching over us,\u201d Halyna said. \u201cWe believe everything will be all right.\u201d",

      "Samoa\u2019s prime minister says she will seek to dissolve Parliament, prompting an early election, after a budget vote failed",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Samoa \u2019s Prime Minister said she would seek to dissolve Parliament, prompting an early election, after a vote on her government\u2019s budget for the next year failed Tuesday.",
      "Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata\u2019afa\u2019s admission of defeat followed months of political havoc in the South Pacific island nation, during which the leader survived two votes of no confidence and struggled on with a minority government. Her budget was rejected during a swift vote in the capital Apia, with 34 lawmakers against it, 16 in favor and two abstaining.",
      "An election must be held within 90 days. Samoa, a country of about 200,000 people, was due to go to the polls next April.",
      "Fiam\u0113 has led Samoa since 2021, when she ousted her predecessor of 22 years. She is the country\u2019s first woman prime minister and in 1991 was the first woman appointed to Samoa's Cabinet.",
      "The daughter of a former prime minister, Fiam\u0113 is one of the region\u2019s longest-serving politicians. She came to power after splitting with the previous leader\u2019s party over constitutional changes that she said would undermine the rule of law.",
      "Fiam\u0113 holds a chiefly rank as a village leader, rare for women in Samoa. She remains an outlier, too, in Pacific island politics, where only 8% of parliamentarians are women, according to January figures from the Inter-Parliamentary Union.",
      "Tuesday's budget defeat capped months of political turmoil after Fiam\u0113 in January sacked a Cabinet member who faced a raft of criminal charges and is also her party\u2019s chairman. He in turn expelled Fiam\u0113 from the FAST party and forced her into a minority government.",
      "She beat two no-confidence motions since. Debate over the efforts to unseat her provoked outrage among some in Samoa when Fiam\u0113\u2019s opponents derided her for being unmarried and suggested she needed a husband\u2019s advice.",
      "Earlier this month Fiam\u0113 told reporters she would contest the election next April. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "In Parliament Tuesday morning, the leader warned lawmakers that rejecting the budget would provoke operational problems for the government, according to Pacific news outlet PMN. Fiam\u0113 also cautioned that a re-registration process for Samoa\u2019s voters, which was expected to conclude before next April\u2019s vote, had only captured 52% of Samoans in the new system so far.",
      "The old registration system was obsolete, her government said last year.",
      "Fiam\u0113 has drawn attention outside Samoa for urging larger powers, such as Australia, to do more to curb the effects of climate change, which have been ruinous for low-lying Pacific island nations. She also took a more cautious approach than her predecessor to Beijing's bankrolling of infrastructure projects in Samoa, which is heavily in debt to China.",
      "Samoa has this year faced severe electricity shortages that Fiam\u0113 warned in April could seriously hamper the country's economy.",

      "The resurgence of Boko Haram attacks in Nigeria's northeast is raising fears about a risk of returning to the peak Boko Haram-era insecurity in the region",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- A resurgence of Boko Haram attacks is shaking Nigeria\u2019s northeast, as Islamic extremists have repeatedly overrun military outposts, mined roads with bombs and raided civilian communities since the start of the year, raising fears of a possible return to peak Boko Haram-era insecurity despite the military's claims of successes.",
      "Boko Haram, Nigeria\u2019s homegrown jihadis, took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law. The conflict has spilled into Nigeria\u2019s northern neighbors and resulted in the death of around 35,000 civilians and the displacement of more than 2 million others, according to the United Nations.",
      "In the latest attack last week in the village of Gajibo in Borno state, the epicenter of the crisis, extremists killed nine members of a local militia that supports the Nigerian military, after soldiers deserted the base when becoming aware of the insurgents\u2019 advance, according to the group\u2019s claim and local aid workers. That is in addition to roadside bombs and deadly attacks on villages in recent months.",
      "Nyelni Kwari's area of Borno, Hawul, includes some of the affected villages, and returning home has become unsafe. \u201cUnfortunately, the situation hasn't improved for me to feel secure,\u201d said Kwari, a graduate student in Borno's capital, Maiduguri.",
      "Boko Haram has split into two factions over the years.",
      "One is backed by the Islamic State group and is known as the Islamic State West Africa Province, or ISWAP. It has become notorious for targeting military positions and has overrun the military on at least 15 occasions this year, killing soldiers and stealing weapons, according to an Associated Press count, experts and security reports.",
      "In May, ISWAP struck outposts in Gajibo, Buni Gari, Marte, Izge and Rann and launched an assault on the Nigeria-Cameroon joint base in Wulgo and Soueram in Cameroon. Other attacks this year have hit Malam Fatori, Goniri, Sabon Gari, Wajiroko and Monguno, among others. The group often attacks at night.",
      "The other faction, Jama\u2019atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda\u2019awati wal-Jihad, or JAS, has increasingly resorted to attacking civilians and perceived collaborators, and thrives on robberies and abductions for ransom.",
      "Malik Samuel, senior researcher at nonprofit Good Governance Africa, said ISWAP\u2019s success is a result of its territorial expansion following gains against rival JAS as well as a decentralized structure that has enhanced its ability to conduct \u201ccoordinated, near-simultaneous attacks across different regions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe unpredictability of attacks under this framework illustrates ISWAP\u2019s growing strategic sophistication,\u201d Samuel said.",
      "External support from IS in Iraq and Syria is also a critical resource, said Samuel, who has interviewed ex-fighters. Such support is evident in ISWAP\u2019s evolving tactics, including nighttime raids, rapid assaults with light but effective weaponry and the use of modified commercial drones to drop explosives, Samuel said.",
      "Ali Abani, a local nonprofit worker familiar with military operations in Borno's strategic town of Dikwa, said army bases are understaffed and located in remote areas, making them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "\"When these gunmen come, they just overpower the soldiers,\u201d Abani said.",
      "Reinforcements, in the form of air support or nearby ground troops, are often too slow to arrive, allowing militants time to strip the outposts of weapons needed to bolster their arsenal, he added, recalling a May 12 attack during which soldiers fled as they were outnumbered, leaving the extremists to cart away weaponry.",
      "There also have been reports of former militants who continued to work as informants and logistics handlers after claiming to have repented.",
      "At its peak in 2013 and 2014, Boko Haram gained global notoriety after kidnapping 276 Chibok schoolgirls and controlling an area the size of Belgium.",
      "While it has lost much of that territory because of military campaigns, the new surge in Boko Haram attacks has raised fears about a possible return to the gloomy past.",
      "Borno Gov. Babagana Zulum warned recently of lost gains after raising concerns that military formations in the state are being dislodged \u201calmost on a daily basis without confrontation.\u201d",
      "Federal lawmakers highlight the extremists' growing sophistication and advanced weaponry, calling on the government to bolster military capabilities.",
      "The Nigerian military didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Last Friday, senior commanders visited one troubled area, Gamboru on the border with Cameroon, promising the deployment of more troops to combat Boko Haram.",

      "The airline announced the change in March, saying at the time that the the new policy would start with flights booked on Wednesday.",
      "Southwest had built years of advertising campaigns around its policy of letting passengers check up to two bags for free. Under its new policy, people who haven\u2019t either reached the upper tiers of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, bought a business class ticket or hold the airline\u2019s credit card will have to pay for checked bags.",

      "A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk\u2019s government efficiency team has been given sweeping powers to overhaul the federal department that manages vast tracts of resource-rich public lands, but he hasn't divested his energy investments or filed an ethics commitment to break ties with companies that pose a conflict of interest, records show.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently directed Tyler Hassen, who lacks Senate confirmation and has no public administration experience, to reorganize the Interior Department, which oversees some 70,000 employees in 11 agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.",
      "Before joining DOGE, Hassen spent nearly two decades as an executive at Basin Holdings, an enterprise involved in the manufacture, sale and servicing of oil rigs worldwide. A financial disclosure report obtained by AP shows Hassen made millions annually from these companies, owned by John Fitzgibbons \u2014 an industry giant who is well-connected in Russia.",
      "These and other potential conflicts of interest are compounding the concerns of Democratic lawmakers, conservation groups and environmental advocates, who say Hassen\u2019s appointment appears designed to evade Senate confirmation and oversight while testing the limits of congressional authority.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dereliction of duty to offload decisions about staffing and funding at the Interior Department to someone who hasn\u2019t even been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d said Kate Groetzinger, with the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation group.",
      "Interior officials didn\u2019t respond to requests to interview Hassen.",
      "Department spokesperson Katie Martin said in an email that Hassen is helping achieve the president\u2019s vision for major changes, and Interior will \u201ccontinue to prioritize retaining first responders, parks services and energy production employees.\u201d",
      "Once inside Interior in January, Hassen reviewed \u201cevery single contract, every single grant,\u201d and sent action items to Burgum, he told FOX News in an April interview. Burgum praised Hassen and DOGE on X, saying they \u201chave identified massive amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse already!\u201d",
      "A draft copy of Interior's new strategic plan includes increasing \u201cclean coal, oil, and gas production through faster permitting\u201d while reducing regulations to \u201cgenerate more revenue from lands and resources for the U.S. Treasury.\u201d",
      "Hassen also has twice filed a notice in the Federal Register extending Trump\u2019s freeze on regulations \u2014 which stops agencies from proposing or issuing new rules \u2014 and removed the opportunity for public comment as \u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u201d The latest extension pushes it to June 4.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how Hassen became involved with Musk. There\u2019s little information about him online. He told FOX News that before DOGE, he was \u201crunning five businesses in Houston.\" He said this work \u201cis me giving back to the country.\u201d",
      "Hassen was an executive at Fitzgibbons-owned Basin Holdings \u2014 the privately held parent company for Basin Energy and Basin Industries \u2014 since 2008. An old Facebook page for Tyler Hassen includes a 2010 photo of him at the \u201cSamotlor Field, Western Siberia - largest oilfield in Russia.\u201d",
      "Hassen\u2019s brother, Todd, is also a Texas energy executive. He's been CEO of Red Wolfpack Resources since 2024 and was with Tellurian, a natural gas company, and EagleStone Resources before that, according to his LinkedIn page.",
      "Burgum named Hassen his assistant secretary for policy, management and budget in March, but changed his title in April to \u201cprincipal deputy assistant secretary.\u201d An assistant secretary requires Senate approval and an ethics commitment to resign positions that would create a conflict of interest. A principal deputy does not.",
      "Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said Interior officials are committing fraud \u201cby calling someone by a different name so that they don\u2019t have to file a really important document where they explain how they\u2019re going to comply with ethics standards.\u201d",
      "Hassen sought to fire a top department lawyer in April for refusing to give him and other DOGE officials access to a highly sensitive personnel database as he pushed for massive department-wide staff reductions through buyouts, early retirements and layoffs. Hassen wrote that Tony Irish, an associate solicitor, was \u201csubverting, obstructing and delaying the process\" and should be removed for misconduct.",
      "Irish is on leave while appealing the firing and is represented by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. \u201cIn seeking to remove Tony Irish, Tyler Hassen has demonstrated his own unfitness for federal service,\u201d PEER executive director Tim Whitehouse said in a press release. \u201cThis type of corporate bullying is not how the people\u2019s business is supposed to be conducted.\u201d",
      "Jacob Malcom, a former Interior Department executive, said Burgum's order directing Hassen to make \u201cappropriate funding decisions\u201d for administrative changes and ensure \u201cthe appropriate transfer of funds, programs, records and property\" is unconstitutional \u2014 Congress appropriates funds, not assistant secretaries.",
      "\u201cUnless Congress has explicitly authorized those funds to be moved, they can\u2019t actually transfer the funds,\u201d Malcom said. \u201cThat\u2019s just flat out illegal.\u201d",
      "Although Hassen didn't file a divestment commitment, he did file a financial disclosure in February \u2014 revised five times, the most recent dated April 21 \u2014 revealing he made almost $4 million annually from Fitzgibbon's oilfield services companies. Hassen said he sold his equity in these companies and is being paid in installments through June 2026.",
      "Hassen reported that he holds $50,001 to $100,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon\u2019s company Block Harvest, a cryptocurrency mining business that uses flared natural gas to run data centers. He reported owning $250,000 to $500,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon\u2019s Global Guardian, a security company.",
      "Hassen also declared 254 stock holdings, including cryptocurrency, tobacco, foreign banking and between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock each in Archrock, a Houston company that specializes in natural gas compression services; WEC Energy Group, which holds electric and natural gas companies and Quanta Services, which is involved in pipelines and pumping.",
      "He's got a similar stake in Albemarle Corp., which owns the Silver Peak lithium mine in Nevada \u2014 the nation's only active lithium source. It's currently seeking authorization from Interior's Bureau of Land Management to expand its operations.",
      "Hassen\u2019s potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among environmental groups and some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "He\u2019s attempting to remove regulations constraining the fossil fuel industries, said Josh Axelrod, a senior policy advocate with the National Resources Defense Council. \u201cAs a member of those industries, he\u2019s uniquely qualified to flag the ones they don\u2019t like.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the ranking Democrats on Interior's Senate and House oversight subcommittees, have demanded a stop to Hassen's large-scale reorganization.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told Burgum in a May 7 letter that \u201cdelegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling.\u201d",

      "YOKOSUKA, Japan -- Money-losing Japanese automaker Nissan is banking on its latest \u201ce-Power\u201d technology for a turnaround.",
      "A kind of hybrid, e-Power comes equipped with both an electric motor and gasoline engine, much like the Toyota Motor Corp. Prius. It\u2019s different from a Prius in that it doesn\u2019t switch back and forth between the motor and engine during the drive.",
      "That means the car always is running on its EV battery, ensuring a quiet, smooth ride.",
      "\u201cNissan has a proud history of pioneering innovative technology that set us apart,\u201d Chief Technology Officer Eiichi Akashi told reporters on the sidelines of a test drive at its Grandrive course outside Tokyo.",
      "The advantage of e-Power vehicles is that they never need to be charged like EVs do. The owner just fuels up at a gas station and the car never runs out of a charge.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp., which racked up a $4.5 billion loss for the fiscal year through March, sorely needs a hot-seller, especially in the lucrative North American market. But the U.S. market is proving a big headache for all the Japanese automakers because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",
      "To achieve a turnaround, Nissan is working on reducing costs, strengthening business partnerships and redefining its lineup. That's where e-Power fits in, according to Akashi.",
      "Yokohama-based Nissan announced earlier this month that it\u2019s slashing about 15% of its global work force, or about 20,000 employees, and reducing the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under an ambitious recovery plan led by its new Chief Executive Ivan Espinosa.",
      "Nissan officials did not give a price for the upcoming e-Power models. The only other automaker offers a similar technology is \u201ckei,\u201d or tiny car manufacturer Suzuki Motor Corp.",
      "E-Power is already offered on the Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail model in Europe, and the Note in Japan. The upgraded version will be offered in the new Rogue in the U.S.",
      "Nissan, a pioneer in EVs with its Leaf, which went on sale in 2010, is also preparing beefed up EV models. It's also working on a solid-state battery which is expected to replace the lithium-ion batteries now widely used in hybrids, EVs and e-Power models.",
      "Analysts say Nissan is in danger of running out of cash and needs a partner. Speculation is rife its Yokohama headquarters building will get sold, or one of its Japan plants will be turned into a casino.",
      "Nissan started talks last year with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. for a business integration but announced in February that it was dropping the talks.",

      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says Southeast Asian nations will forge a common front to face challenges including economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs and the four-year deadly civil war in Myanmar",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Southeast Asian nations will forge a common front to face challenges including economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs and a four-year civil war in Myanmar, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday.",
      "Opening an annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Anwar said he has sought a unified bloc meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss the tariffs. Officials are hopeful it could happen later this year. Malaysia is the current chair of ASEAN.",
      "\u201cFor ASEAN, our peace, stability and prosperity have often depended on an open, inclusive, rules-based international order... These foundations are now being dismantled under the force of arbitrary action,\" Anwar said.",
      "ASEAN, which has agreed to avoid retaliatory measures, has formed a taskforce to coordinate a response to the U.S. tariffs in parallel with bilateral negotiations by some member countries, Anwar said. ASEAN members include bigger economies such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.",
      "The region relies on exports to the U.S. and is hurt by the Trump administration's tariffs, which range from 10% for Singapore to as high as 49% for Cambodia. Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs in April for most of the world, and this month struck a similar deal with key rival China, easing trade war tensions.",
      "Anwar said an ASEAN leaders' meeting on Tuesday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 the first such tripartite meeting \u2014 would spur new cooperation that could help insulate ASEAN's economy. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "ASEAN leaders later Monday will launch a new 20-year vision to deepen their economic and social integration, Anwar said.",
      "Analysts said China, which is ASEAN's top trading partner, wants to expand its influence by presenting itself as a reliable ally in the region. But tensions persist over Beijing's aggressive stance in the disputed South China Sea that has led to frequent clashes especially with the Philippines.",
      "Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told the ASEAN summit that a \"code of conduct\u201d being negotiated by ASEAN and China to govern the busy sea passage must be binding \u2014 one of the factors that has hampered talks.",
      "\u201cWe underscore the urgent need to accelerate the adoption of a legally binding code of conduct in the South China Sea to safeguard maritime rights, promote stability and prevent miscalculations at sea,\u201d he said.",
      "On the Myanmar crisis, Anwar said Malaysia has managed to \u201cmove the needle forward\u201d after forming an informal advisory group headed by former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra. Anwar met last month with Myanmar military chief Gen. Ming Aung Hlaing in Bangkok and held virtual talks with the opposition National Unity Government.",
      "Officials said the current emphasis on aid delivery following a March earthquake that killed 3,700 people could eventually pave the way for peace talks. But critics accuse the army of violating a self-proclaimed ceasefire with dozens of airstrikes, with aid not freely allowed into areas not under the army\u2019s control.",
      "The Myanmar war, which has killed thousands and displaced millions, is a challenge to ASEAN since refugees have fled across borders to neighboring nations. The region has also seen rising transnational crimes and cybercrimes. The bloc has made little headway after the Myanmar military refused to comply with its peace plan, including a ceasefire, delivery of humanitarian aid and negotiations.",
      "Anwar said more engagement is being planned in Myanmar.",
      "\u201cQuiet engagement matters. The steps may be small and the bridge may be fragile but as they say: In matters of peace, even a fragile bridge is better than a widening gulf,\u201d Anwar said.",
      "Thomas Daniel from Malaysia's Institute of Strategic and International Studies said ASEAN has no real leverage to push for reconciliation. The Myanmar military has reportedly lost control of a large part of the country, making the situation even more challenging.",
      "\u201cThe conditions on the ground are extremely difficult. I don\u2019t think we have reached a stage where ASEAN can facilitate any kind of political dialogue between conflicting parties. They are not ready for that yet,\u201d he said.",

      "About 100 people had to be evacuated after the plane struck at least one home and jet fuel caught fire throughout the neighborhood. The Federal Aviation Administration said six people were aboard the plane. It wasn't clear how many died, although music agency Sound Talent Group said its co-founder and two other employees died in the crash.",
      "Many people are concerned about aviation safety after all the aircraft collisions and near-misses.",
      "Disasters have ranged from the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington, D.C., in January to an airliner clipping another in February while taxiing at the Seattle airport. In March, an American Airlines plane caught fire after landing in Denver, sending 12 people to the hospital. A sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey last month, killing six people.",
      "Federal officials have tried to reassure travelers that flying is the safest mode of transportation, and statistics support that. But the cascade of headlines about all the things that have gone wrong is drawing increasing attention.",
      "Here is a look at some of the recent tragedies and mishaps:",
      "\u2014 The New York helicopter that crashed on April 10 departed a downtown heliport. The flight lasted less than 18 minutes. Radar data shows the helicopter flew north along the Manhattan skyline, then south toward the Statue of Liberty. The victims in this crash included a family from Spain who was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children.",
      "\u2014 Three people were killed and one was injured when a small plane crashed April 11 in Boca Raton, Florida, near a major interstate highway and pushed a car onto railroad tracks.",
      "\u2014 Two small planes collided midair near an Arizona airport in mid-February, killing two people who were on one of the aircraft. Following the collision, one plane landed uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. The crash happened at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson.",
      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and two people on the ground. About two dozen people were also hurt. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",
      "\u2014 The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",
      "\u2014 A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in late December in South Korea after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries.",
      "\u2014 A single-engine plane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames that same month in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Everyone on board survived. Three people were taken to an area burn center.",
      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries. Witnesses and video from the scene showed the plane landing so hard that its right wing was sheared off. Investigators said when trying to determine the cause, they would consider the weather conditions and the possibility of human error.",
      "\u2014 Earlier this month, two commercial planes had to abort their landings at Reagan National Airport near Washington because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter flying near the Pentagon. The Army suspended all its helicopter flights in the area after this incident. It was a Black Hawk priority air transport from the same unit known as the PAT25 that collided with the passenger jet in midair in January.",
      "\u2014 In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights.",
      "\u2014 A FedEx cargo plane made an emergency landing at a busy New Jersey airport in March after a bird strike caused an engine fire that could be seen in the morning sky. The plane landed at Newark Liberty International Airport. There were no reported injuries.",
      "\u2014 Pilots on a Southwest Airlines flight about to land at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport were forced to climb back into the sky to avoid another aircraft crossing the runway in late February. Video showed the plane approaching the runway before it abruptly pulled up as a business jet taxied onto the runway without authorization, federal officials said.",
      "\u2014 In early February, a Japan Airlines plane was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when it apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta plane. There were no injuries reported.",
      "\u2014 In early January, passengers panicked when a man aboard a JetBlue plane taxiing for takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, triggering an emergency slide to inflate. Other passengers quickly restrained the man and the plane didn't take off.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "In a story published May 22, 2025, about recent aircraft tragedies, The Associated Press erroneously reported the date of a small plane crash in Boca Raton, Florida. The crash happened April 11, not May 16.",

      "The Publix supermarket chain is recalling fruit and vegetable baby food because testing found elevated levels of lead",
      "The supermarket chain Publix has recalled fruit and vegetable baby food sold in eight states because product testing found elevated levels of lead, according to federal health officials.",
      "Publix recalled 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold at more than 1,400 stores.",
      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",
      "The potential contamination was flagged by officials in North Carolina, the state that first identified a 2023 lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches that sickened more than 500 U.S. children.",
      "Routine sampling of the baby food pouches found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, according to North Carolina agriculture officials. That exceeds the FDA's recommended limit of 10 parts per billion for such products intended for babies and young children.",
      "Publix said all the potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves. No illnesses have been reported, the company said. Customers can return the pouches to local stores for full refund.",
      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",
      "Federal health officials eventually identified 566 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of lead poisoning tied to the pouches in 44 states.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's childhood lead poisoning program investigated the applesauce outbreak and coordinated state and federal response. However, the program was eliminated in April as part of federal funding cuts under the Trump administration.",
      "CDC officials didn't say whether or how the agency would respond to a similar outbreak now. A spokesperson said the agency is aware of the Publix baby food recall but hasn't been asked to assist with any investigation.",
      "There is no safe level of lead exposure, according to CDC. While the heavy metal is toxic to people of all ages, it can be especially harmful to children, causing damage to the brain and nervous system and slow growth and development.",
      "Heavy metals like lead can get into food products from soil, air, water or industrial processes, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

      "House Republicans are jubilant about muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans were jubilant after muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote. But across the Capitol, senators were more cautious.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that, right now, who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference.",
      "Republicans\u2019 aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to review it. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll put our stamp on it,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWhat does it take to get to 51?\u201d",
      "A look at a few of the potential sticking points in the Senate:",
      "Several Republican senators have said the House\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar tax package doesn't have enough savings. Thune said many in his GOP conference favor the tax breaks in the bill but \u201cwhen it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time, in history, where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about how to control government spending.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a sharp critic of the House bill, wants the United States to go back to pre-pandemic spending levels. He has indicated he would be a no on the bill as it stands now, and he says he has at least three other senators aligned with him.",
      "Senate Republicans are generally on board with stricter work requirements for older Medicaid recipients that make up much of the bill\u2019s $700 billion savings from the program. But Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Susan Collins of Maine, among others, have voiced concerns about other changes in the bill that could potentially cut funding to rural hospitals or increase copays and other health care costs for recipients.",
      "The senators could have a powerful ally in Trump, who has frequently said he doesn\u2019t want cuts to Medicaid, even as he\u2019s endorsed the House bill. Hawley said he talked to Trump this week on the phone and \u201chis exact words were, \u2018Don\u2019t touch it, Josh.\u2019\u201d",
      "Others have been wary of the House bill\u2019s effort to shift some costs of the food stamp program to states, potentially a major issue for some red states that have high numbers of food aid recipients. The House bill saves $290 billion from the food aid, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said the Senate savings will be \u201cprobably be a little bit lower.\u201d",
      "Thune said this week that \u201cone of the principal differences\u201d between the House and Senate is that Republican senators want to make many of the tax cuts permanent while the House bill has shorter time frames for many of its cuts \u2014 including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car-loan interest and others.",
      "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said Thursday that trying to make some of the cuts permanent is \u201can objective right now.\"",
      "One of the biggest questions for the Senate: whether the tax breaks really need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
      "To offset the costs of lost tax revenue, House Republicans have proposed more than $1 trillion in spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and green energy program rollbacks. However, Republicans in the Senate do not believe there is a cost associated with permanently extending the existing taxes, setting up a political and procedural showdown ahead.",
      "The House bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States is on track to run out of money to pay its bills as early as August without congressional action.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he won\u2019t support the bill if the debt ceiling increase is included. He said he\u2019s willing to consider it if it\u2019s taken out.",
      "But most Republican senators want it to avoid a separate fight that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that if they deal with the debt ceiling outside of the legislation then they would have to \u201cpay a king\u2019s ransom\u201d to Democrats to get enough votes.",
      "Several Republican senators have said they are concerned about House provisions that repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 that have spurred investment in many states.",
      "Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Moran wrote Thune a letter last month arguing that removing the credits could \"create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.\u201d",
      "The House bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, giving the federal government more control over the policy. It\u2019s an approach that has been favored by the AI industry but has drawn concern from members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "And even if it has enough support, the provision may not pass muster from the Senate parliamentarian because it\u2019s unlikely to have impact on the federal budget.",
      "With a narrow margin for victory and only 53 Republicans in the Senate, every senator\u2019s top priority takes on outsize importance. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he supports the House bill but that the way that it deals with spectrum auctions \u2014 selling off telecommunications signal rights \u2014 is a \u201cdealbreaker\u201d for him. He said he\u2019s in talks with other senators on the issue.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said one of his main goals is that they include money for certain farm safety net programs and set up passage for a broader farm bill later this year.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have to have 50 plus one supporting it,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got some work to do.\"",

      "LOS ANGELES -- U.S. homeowners are spending more on home renovation projects, bucking a broader pullback by consumers amid diminished confidence in the economy.",
      "Sales at building materials and garden supply retailers rose 0.8% last month from March, the biggest gain since 2022, and were up 3.2% from April last year. At the same time, U.S. retail sales overall rose 0.1%, a sharp slowdown from March.",
      "The trend comes even as prices for home improvement products have been rising.",
      "The cost of home repairs and remodeling climbed by nearly 4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Verisk\u2019s Remodel Index. The strategic data analytics firm tracks costs for more than 10,000 home repair items, from appliances to windows.",
      "Recent price increases appear to be driven primarily by labor costs and don't appear to reflect the ongoing trade war that the Trump administration is engaged in with major U.S. trading partners like Mexico, China and Canada.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen panic buying from contractors or investors concerned about the impact tariffs might have on future costs, or labor rates being driven up by stricter enforcement of immigration policies,\" Greg Pyne, vice president of pricing for Verisk Property Estimating Solutions, said in a report earlier this month.",
      "Home Depot said Tuesday that it doesn\u2019t expect to raise prices because of tariffs, saying it has spent years diversifying the sources for the goods on its shelves. However, executive Billy Bastek said some products now on Home Depot shelves may disappear.",
      "He also noted that the chain is seeing fewer customers taking on large home improvement jobs like kitchen and bath remodels, because high interest rates may be dissuading homeowners from borrowing money to finance such projects.",
      "Spending on home renovations has remained resilient as elevated mortgage rates and skyrocketing home prices have frozen out many would-be buyers. That's kept U.S. home sales in a slump, limiting the market for homeowners who want to sell.",
      "Many homeowners also bought or refinanced their mortgage when the average rate on a 30-year home loan was below 3% or 4% in the first couple of years of the pandemic. That's made them reluctant to sell now, when the average rate is hovering near 7%.",
      "In response, many homeowners have opted to to invest in sprucing up their home rather than sell and take on a mortgage with a sharply higher interest rate.",
      "A shortfall in new home construction more than a decade in the making has kept people living in older homes longer. Nearly half of the owner-occupied homes in the U.S. were built before 1980 and have a median age of 41 years, according to an analysis of Census data by the National Association of Home Builders. That aging stock of homes has helped fuel the need for repairs and improvements.",
      "Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies\u2019 most recent quarterly outlook of home improvement projects that spending on home renovations will continue to increase this year, despite economic uncertainty.",
      "Spending by homeowners on maintenance and home improvement projects increased 0.5% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $513 billion, according to the JCHS' leading indicator of remodeling activity, or LIRA.",
      "It also forecasts annual increases from here that will drive spending to $526 billion by the first quarter of next year. That would represent a 2.5% increase from the first quarter of this year.",
      "Rising home prices and signs of a solid economy have supported the outlook for higher spending on home improvement, but that could change if the housing market and economic outlook worsen, said Carlos Mart\u00edn, director of the JCHS\u2019 Remodeling Futures Program.",
      "\u201cBuilding materials retail sales are strong, but we are seeing a significant downturn in the sales of existing homes and their median sales price since the last projection \u2014 both are known contributors to home improvements,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBroader economic turbulence like a recession, a worsening job market or higher inflation would almost certainly temper our expectations.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- A consortium led by U.S. investment firm RedBird Capital Partners has agreed to buy the publisher of Britain\u2019s 170-year-old Daily Telegraph newspaper for about 500 million pounds ($674 million), the two sides said Friday.",
      "Redbird said it has reached an agreement in principle to become controlling owner of the Telegraph Media Group, ending a lengthy takeover saga for the conservative-leaning newspaper.",

      "The group, previously owned by Britain\u2019s Barclay family, was put up for sale two years ago to help pay off the family\u2019s debts. It published the daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers and weekly newsmagazine The Spectator, which all are closely allied to Britain\u2019s Conservative Party.",
      "In 2023 there was an offer to buy the publications from RedBird IMI, a consortium backed by RedBird Capital Partners and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi\u2019s royal family and the vice president of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "But the consortium pulled out last year following strong opposition from the U.K. government, which launched legislation to block foreign state ownership of the British press.",
      "The Spectator was sold separately in September to British hedge fund investor Paul Marshall.",
      "Telegraph Media Group chief executive Anna Jones said, \u201cRedBird Capital Partners have exciting growth plans that build on our success \u2014 and will unlock our full potential across the breadth of our business.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "News that air traffic controllers directing planes into New Jersey\u2019s busiest airport twice lost both their radar and radios is alarming",
      "It was alarming news when air traffic controllers directing planes coming and going around one of the nation's busiest airports repeatedly lost their radar and radio communications, but pilots, independent air safety experts and the Federal Aviation Administration say other redundant systems kept planes from colliding.",
      "\u201cI think the risk of a collision or an incident was increased, but not significantly because of the redundancy in the aviation system,\u201d said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Crashes like January's deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter usually have different causes \u2014 a combination of many things that go wrong, he says.",
      "Here's a look at what happened in Newark \u2014 and how key pieces of the safety net protected planeloads of people.",
      "The radar and communications systems that a terminal control team in Philadelphia relies on to direct planes in and out of Newark International Airport simultaneously failed twice in the past month for brief periods. The main line that carries the radar signal from another FAA facility in New York failed, and the backup line didn\u2019t work immediately. The system relies in part on aging copper wires and even when there are fiber optic lines, the signal has to be slowed down when it reaches the facility because the FAA computers are so old they can't handle all the data at full speed.",
      "As a result, the controllers were suddenly unable to see or communicate with planes coming from or going to Newark for as long as 90 seconds on April 28 and May 9. Their radar screens showing each flights in motion suddenly went black. Their radio connections went silent.",
      "The main line failed a third time May 11, but the backup system worked and the radar stayed online. The FAA said a fourth outage Monday knocked out radio communications for two seconds, but the radar stayed online.",
      "After the initial outage, the already shorthanded control center in Philadelphia lost five to seven controllers to trauma leave. Newark's terminal control team could no longer manage a full schedule of handoffs with the airport's control tower, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays that rippled across the nation's airlines. The FAA then imposed safety limits, allowing no more than 28 arrivals and 28 departures every hour. Before, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly.",
      "When air traffic controllers lose the ability to see or speak to airborne planes, they can try text messaging the pilots via data link systems or try high-powered portable radios. An emergency radio frequency might also be an alternative if main communications are down. Tower controllers have high-powered light guns to send a green or red signal to pilots to let them know if they are clear to land even if they can't talk to them over the radio.",
      "And the entire air traffic control system is built on an overlapping network of radar sites. So if a terminal control team like the one in Philadelphia loses its communications, a controller in a radar center that normally directs planes at higher altitudes might step in. If some other controller in the area hears a pilot broadcasting on an emergency frequency, they too can relay a message.",
      "During these Philadelphia outages, voice communications came back online first while the radar took another minute to reboot, and controllers were able to hand off planes without having to resort to some of those other options.",
      "In a May 9 recording captured by www.liveATC.net, a controller can be heard saying \u201cFedEx 1989. I'm going to hand you off here. Our scopes just went black again. If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.\u201d The pilot acknowledged that and wished the controllers \u201cgood luck guys\u201d before switching frequencies.",
      "Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau has tried to reassure the public that all these backups and limits on the number of flights keep flying safe, despite these problems that have exposed how fragile and outdated some air traffic control systems have become.",
      "\u201cWhen disruptions occur at any airport because of equipment issues or staffing, the FAA will always ensure safety by slowing down airport arrivals and departures and reducing congestion,\u201d Rocheleau posted on X. \u201cWe keep the flying public safe because there are redundancies built throughout the entire system used by pilots, technicians and air traffic controllers.\u201d",
      "Every pilot is trained on what to do if they can't talk to the air traffic controllers, and modern passenger jets have their own backup systems. Airline pilots all regularly get refresher training emphasizing safety.",
      "Capt. Miles Morgan oversees all training for 17,000 United Airlines pilots at a facility in Denver filled with simulators and classrooms. He said losing communications is rare, but it's something pilots prepare for, as most training focuses on what to do if something goes wrong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been flying for 30 years. I\u2019ve got almost 18,000 hours in United airplanes -- jets, and I\u2019ve lost communication one time,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt really ended up not being that big of a deal. I just went to the emergency frequency, got a different channel, and contacted a different facility to get back into communication.\u201d",
      "In addition to multiple communications systems, planes are equipped with collision avoidance technology that shows pilots where all the other planes are moving around them. These systems alert pilots to an approaching aircraft's trajectory and can recommend evasive action to prevent a collision if planes get too close, Morgan said.",
      "Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said that when pilots lose contact with controllers, their first action is to continue on their last-directed path. If the outage continues, they'll broadcast their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower \u2014 as they follow their flight plans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not to downplay the seriousness of communication failure or radar outages, but it\u2019s to recognize that we have procedures, we trained to those procedures, and we have additional equipment that can only enhance the safety margin while we deal with that scenario,\u201d Tajer said.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of Louisiana environmental groups is suing the state over a law they say violates their free speech rights by restricting them from sharing information about air quality",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- On days of heavy pollution in Sulphur, a southwest Louisiana town surrounded by more than 16 industrial plants, Cynthia \u201cCindy\u201d Robertson once flew a red flag outside her home so her community knew they faced health hazards from high levels of soot and other pollutants.",
      "But she stopped flying the flag after Louisiana passed a law last May that threatened fines of up to $1 million for sharing information about air quality that did not meet strict standards.",
      "On Thursday, Robertson's group Micah 6:8 Mission and other Louisiana environmental organizations sued the state in federal court over the law they say restricts their free speech and undermines their ability to promote public health in heavily industrialized communities.",
      "When neighbors asked where the flags went, \"I\u2019d tell them, \u2019The state of Louisiana says we can\u2019t tell y\u2019all that stuff,' \u201d Robertson said.",
      "While the state has argued the law ensures that accurate data is shared with the public, environmental groups like Micah 6:8 Mission believed it was intended to censor them with \u201conerous restrictions\u201d and violates their free speech rights, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Despite having received Environmental Protection Agency funding to monitor Sulphur's pollution using high quality air monitors for several years, Michah 6:8 Mission stopped posting data on the group's social media after the law was signed last May, Robertson said.",
      "While federal law requires publicly disclosed monitoring of major pollutants, fence-line communities in Louisiana have long sought data on their exposure to hazardous and likely carcinogenic chemicals like chloroprene and ethylene oxide, which were not subject to these same regulations.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened regulations for these pollutants, though the Trump administration has committed to rolling them back.",
      "The Biden administration's EPA also injected funding to support community-based air monitoring, especially in neighborhoods on the \u201cfence-line\u201d with industrial plants that emitted pollutants that they were not required to publicly monitor under federal law. Some groups say they lack confidence in the data the state does provide and embraced the chance to monitor the air themselves with federal funding.",
      "\u201cThese programs help detect pollution levels in areas of the country not well served by traditional and costly air monitoring systems,\u201d the lawsuit stated.",
      "In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana's Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants \u201cfor the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance\u201d of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cYou can't talk about air quality unless you're using the equipment that they want you to use,\u201d said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which represents the plaintiffs. He added there was no need for community groups to purchase such expensive equipment when cheaper technology could provide \u201cperfectly adequate results ... to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they're breathing is safe.\u201d",
      "Community groups sharing information based on cheaper air monitoring equipment that did not meet these requirements could face penalties of $32,500 a day and up to $1 million for intentional violations, according to analysis from the Environmental Integrity Project.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a small nonprofit, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay one day's worth of that,\u201d Robertson said. \"And the way the law is written, it\u2019s so ambiguous, you don\u2019t really know what you can and can\u2019t do.\"",
      "There is no known instance in which the state has pursued these penalties, but community groups say the law has a chilling effect on their work.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this was very clear: to silence the science, preventing people from doing anything with it, sharing it in any form,\u201d said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for Rise St. James, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs \u2018violates their constitutional rights\u2019,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill countered in a written statement.",
      "Industry groups are excluded from the law's requirements, the lawsuit notes.",
      "The law presumes \u201cthat air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,\u201d the complaint states.",

      "That edition of the tournament in New York only placed line judges on its two largest courts, while others used an electronic setup, a nod to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australian Open got rid of all line judges in 2021, a first at a tennis major; the U.S. Open did the same later that year.",
      "The French Open remains a holdout, and that's not likely to change anytime soon.",
      "\u201cUnless the players are unanimous and come to us and say, \u2018We won\u2019t play if there isn\u2019t a machine\u2019 ... then I think we\u2019ve got a great future ahead of us to maintain this style of refereeing,\u201d French federation president Gilles Moretton said, while boasting of the quality of his country's officials.",
      "Players don't sound that adamant, although they tend to echo the opinion of 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, who is 21: \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like the \u2018Gen Z\u2019 in me, but I think if we have the technology, we should use it.\u201d",
      "Still, there is some charm to be found in the choreography of players insisting a call was wrong and chair umpires climbing down for a closer look at a ball mark on the clay. Watch a day of TV coverage from Paris and odds are good that dance will take place \u2014 probably more than once.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what makes clay special, in a way \u2014 that you can always review the shots. ... Obviously, you can\u2019t deny that electronic line-calling is the future, and everything is moving towards AI and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Stefanos Tsitsipas, the runner-up to Djokovic at Roland-Garros four years ago. \"But me, personally, I wouldn\u2019t mind playing on clay with maybe the judgment of a human instead of a robot.\u201d",
      "No matter the form of officiating, there invariably are times when athletes \u2014 perhaps eyesight or faith strained by heat-of-the-moment tension and an eagerness to be correct \u2014 just won't agree with a call.",
      "That, in turn, can lead to extended arguments and sometimes a scene seen recently: A player grabs a cell phone from the sideline to snap a photo of a mark in a bid to prove, and win, a point.",
      "Aryna Sabalenka, a three-time Slam champ and No. 1 women's player, and Alexander Zverev, a three-time major finalist, did just that, although they weren't the first. Back at the 2013 French Open, Sergiy Stakhovsky put down his racket and took a picture of where a ball had landed during a loss to Richard Gasquet; Stakhovsky said then he'd done it before.",
      "\u201cLinespeople mess up sometimes,\u201d said 2023 Australian Open semifinalist Tommy Paul. \u201cAutomatic line-calling is going to mess up probably less.\u201d",

      "Regional winners advance to best-of-three super regionals next week, and the final eight go to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, beginning June 13.",
      "Northeastern's 27-game win streak is the longest in Division I since Fairfield rolled off 28 straight in 2021. The Huskies (48-9) are making their fourth NCAA appearance since 2018 under Mike Glavine, younger brother of Baseball Hall of Fame member Tom Glavine. The Huskies are the No. 2 regional seed in Tallahassee, Florida, and open against Mississippi State.",
      "No. 13 national seed Coastal Carolina (48-11) brings an 18-game streak into its home regional. The Chanticleers swept the Sun Belt regular-season and tournament titles under Kevin Schnall, who took over for longtime coach Gary Gilmore this year. They open against Fairfield.",
      "Columbia (29-17) has won nine in a row and 16 of 17. The Ivy League champions are a No. 4 regional seed and meet No. 16 national seed Southern Mississippi.",

      "East Carolina (33-25), which received the American Athletic's automatic bid by winning the conference tournament as a No. 6 seed, has never reached the College World Series in 34 previous NCAA Tournament appearances, the longest streak of its kind. The Pirates are in the field for the ninth time in 10 years.",
      "Clemson (44-16) has never won a national championship, or finished as runner-up, in 46 previous appearances.",
      "The curse of the No. 1 national seed was finally broken last year when Tennessee won the national championship. Before that, the only No. 1 to win it all was Miami in 1999.",
      "Big South Tournament champion USC Upstate, a full Division I member since 2011, is making its tournament debut. The Spartans are second in the nation in scoring at 9.7 runs per game, and Johnny Sweeney is third in RBIs (81) and Scott Campbell is 17th in batting average (.400). They open at No. 11 national seed Clemson, just over an hour southwest of their Spartanburg, South Carolina, campus.",
      "The Oxford Regional, hosted by Mississippi, gets the nod.",

      "Their opponent, Murray State (39-13), is in the tournament for the first time since 2003 after winning the Missouri Valley Tournament. The Racers had a three-run lead against the Rebels in Oxford on March 5 before losing 8-7 in 10 innings.",
      "Georgia Tech (40-17), the No. 2 regional seed, is the first ACC regular-season champion since 1999 to not host. The Yellow Jackets are matched against Western Kentucky (46-12), which set a school record for wins and has the Conference USA player and newcomer of the year in Ryan Wideman and pitcher of the year in Drew Whalen.",
      "Regional hosts have advanced to super regionals 66.8% of the time (267 of 400) since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. Last year, 10 hosts won regionals.",
      "The fewest hosts to advance were seven in 2007 and 2014, eight in 2018 and nine in 2017 and 2023.",
      "Eleven projected first-round picks in the Major League Baseball amateur draft are in the tournament, including four of the top six, according to MLB.com analyst Jim Callis.",

      "Next are Oregon State SS Aiva Arquette (6), Oklahoma RHP Kyson Witherspoon (11), North Carolina C Luke Stevenson (16), Tennessee 2B Gavin Kilen (18), Wake Forest SS Marek Houston (19), Arizona OF Brendan Summerhill (20), Auburn OF-C Ike Irish (21) and Southern Mississippi RHP J.B. Middleton (22).",
      "Oregon center fielder and leadoff man Mason Neville is first in the nation in homers with a school-record 26, and 42 of his 61 hits have gone for extra bases. But Neville enters regionals just 2 for his last 27, and he has gone a season-high five straight games without a homer.",
      "The best player you've probably never heard of is Northeastern left-handed pitcher Will Jones. The 6-foot-5, 215-pound graduate student is second in the nation with a 1.82 ERA and third in wins with an 11-0 record. He has been part of five of the Huskies' nation-leading 17 shutouts.",
      "Jones had Tommy John surgery when he was in high school in Southampton, Massachusetts, and didn't throw a pitch his first two seasons with the Huskies. He threw in 48 innings over 21 appearances, including two starts, in 2023 and \u201824. He has pitched 69 1/3 innings this season with 72 strikeouts, and his 11 wins are a school record.",
      "California has six teams in regionals, most among the 25 states represented in the tournament.",
      "Cal Poly, Fresno State, Southern California, UC Irvine, UCLA and Saint Mary's are the Golden State schools that earned bids.",

      "Even the NBA MVP needs a wing man",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- With Oklahoma City clutching a four-point lead, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drove into the lane and smacked into triple coverage \u2014 doing the splits as he stopped and desperately tried to find a safe place for the ball.",
      "Somehow, as he lost his balance and fell toward the court, he found space to fling it between the legs of Minnesota's Jaden McDaniels \u2014 and straight to a wide-open Jalen Williams behind the arc with 1:21 to go.",
      "Swish. Game. Maybe even the series.",
      "The Thunder saw that seven-point lead shrink back to one in the closing seconds, but they staved off the late push with a parade to the free-throw line and pulled out a 128-126 victory in Game 4 that gave them a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference finals.",
      "Even the NBA MVP needs a wing man, and Gilgeous-Alexander has two. Williams and Chet Holmgren were so good in their own ways that a 40-point, 10-assist, nine-rebound performance by Gilgeous-Alexander on Monday night was somehow overshadowed.",
      "Williams had 13 of his 34 points in the first quarter to give the Thunder the scoring to match their tenacious start after a 42-point loss in Game 3. He shot 13 for 24, including 6 for 9 from 3-point range, and pitched in three of the team's 14 steals.",
      "\u201cFrom start to finish, he picked his spots great, he was aggressive, stepped into everything,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cHe was who he is. He\u2019s gotten all these awards this year for a good reason, and he proved it tonight. He\u2019s a really good basketball player. It\u2019s crazy to think he\u2019s so young and what he has already achieved.\u201d",
      "Holmgren had nine of his 21 points in the fourth quarter. He went 9 for 14 from the floor, grabbed four of his seven rebounds on the offensive end and blocked three shots \u2014 including a highlight-reel rejection of McDaniels in the final minute in a five-point game.",
      "After McDaniels followed his hard drive right with a slick spin move to beat him to the basket for a left-side layup attempt, Holmgren never lost his footing despite the change in direction and swiftly slid to his right before a perfectly timed jump to swat the ball without fouling as the clock dropped under the 40-second mark.",
      "\u201cOn both ends of the floor, he affects the game at such a high level,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s crazy because he\u2019s out there just running around right now. We rarely call plays for him. He rarely gets anything set for him. He\u2019s just out there playing off of feel and affecting the game at a high level, whether it\u2019s making open shots, blocking shots, offensive rebounding, defensive rebounding.",
      "\"He\u2019s just a winning player.\u201d",
      "Though the Timberwolves regained possession after a charging foul on Gilgeous-Alexander, precious more time went by before they scored again on a 3-pointer by McDaniels with 23 seconds left.",
      "Gilgeous-Alexander helped ice the game at the line, and Williams eventually grabbed a desperation inbounds pass by the Timberwolves from half-court with 0.3 seconds left.",
      "Holmgren, the second overall pick in the 2022 draft who missed his entire rookie season with a foot injury and 50 games this season following a pelvic fracture from a hard fall, happily left his hometown with a statement performance that put him and his teammates within one win of reaching the NBA Finals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have really good players that the other team needs to stop, they\u2019re going to have to help recover from somewhere,\u201d Holmgren said. \"So just understanding that we have to make them pay for that and just try to be aggressive, try to make the right play, too. It\u2019s not always score. Sometimes it\u2019s make the extra pass, sometimes it\u2019s find the next action, whatever it is, just try to leave fingerprints on the game and make winning plays.\u201d",
      "Despite playing in one of the league's smallest markets, the trio already has its own commercial, a humorous spot for AT&T highlighting the importance of communication when they all show up for a red-carpet event in the exact same outfits.",
      "The camaraderie isn't an act.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all really cool with each other, to be honest,\u201d said Williams, the 12th overall pick in the 2022 draft who made his first All-Star team this season. \"Off-the-court chemistry seeps into on the court. We\u2019ve just grown up together. Obviously Shai\u2019s a little bit older than us, but we\u2019ve been through a lot of experiences in a short amount of time that have either forced us to trust each other or grow apart, and we\u2019ve grown closer to each other.",
      "\"That\u2019s just kind of how we play \u2014 live and die by trusting each other, and whatever happens from there happens.\u201d",

      "The commissioner of the Southeastern Conference is hearing an increased amount of interest from his league\u2019s leaders about a previously little-discussed idea of expanding the College Football Playoff from 12 to 16 teams",
      "MIRAMAR BEACH, Fla. -- The commissioner of the Southeastern Conference is hearing increased interest from his league's leaders about a previously little-discussed idea of expanding the College Football Playoff from 12 to 16 teams.",
      "\u201cSixteen has had more traction in my league than I would've anticipated,\u201d Greg Sankey said Monday at the kickoff of the league's annual meetings.",
      "A move to 14 teams had been widely viewed as the next expansion, but Sankey said \"16 has become more central in the conversation. We're interested, not committed, but the interest level has gone higher.\u201d",
      "The future of the playoff will be among the topics discussed among school presidents, athletic directors and coaches in what might be the most consequential of the many conference meetings taking place this spring.",
      "Last week, all 10 conferences and Notre Dame provided the unanimous agreement needed to move to a straight seeding model for next year's playoff, which will remain a 12-team affair.",
      "It's a move Sankey started pushing for shortly after last season's bracket elevated Arizona State and Boise State \u2014 each ranked ninth or lower by the playoff selection committee \u2014 into the top four, where they received first-round byes.",
      "The next major shakeup will comes for the 2026 season, where the SEC and Big Ten will play the biggest decision-making role in what comes for the six-year, $7.8 billion ESPN contract that covers the playoff through 2031.",
      "The commissioner said he is neither committed to the 16-team idea, nor to the oft-floated idea of providing up to four automatic bids to both the SEC and Big Ten in whatever format comes next.",
      "A shift to more automatic bids for the SEC could lead the league to scrap its conference title game \u2014 a concept hatched 33 years ago by former SEC commissioner Roy Kramer \u2014 in favor of some slate of \u201cplay-in\u201d games for those automatic spots.",
      "It could be a money maker. Ultimately, all schools desperately need to increase revenue to cover the $20.5 million in direct name, image, likeness payments, along with added expenses for financial aid \u2014 all of which come into play if a federal judge approves settlement terms of a long-running lawsuit that could be wrapped up while the meetings are happening this week.",
      "But Sankey said no decisions have been made, and this is the week for hashing them out.",
      "\u201cWe'll look a little bit more deeply at different ideas, which will put me at some point in a better position to answer those questions,\u201d Sankey said.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton blamed himself for the Indiana Pacers' second-half collapse in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals.",
      "Coach Rick Carlisle figured Haliburton's teammates played their part, too.",
      "Less than 24 hours after blowing a 16-point lead in the final 20 minutes Sunday night and allowing the New York Knicks to cut their series deficit to 2-1, the Pacers went back to work Monday in search of solutions. Game 4 will be Tuesday night in Indianapolis.",
      "\u201cI felt like we got kind of stagnant on that end,\u201d Haliburton said minutes after the 106-100 loss. \u201cI thought we just didn't do a good job of continuing to play fast. I felt like I did a poor job of keeping pace in the game, especially in the fourth quarter. I feel like I was walking the ball up every play, so I know it's got to be a big area of improvement for me.\u201d",
      "Clearly, it wasn't just Haliburton \u2014 or his teammates \u2014 struggling to seal a victory that would have put the Pacers within one win of reaching the franchise's second NBA Finals.",
      "An increasingly aggressive Karl-Anthony Towns scored 20 of his team's 36 points in the fourth quarter and an increasingly shifty defense slowed down Indiana just enough to hold them to a playoff-low 42 points in the second half. Carlisle credited the Knicks' defense for making the right adjustments.",
      "And just like that, New York managed to avoid the dreaded 3-0 hole that no team has recovered from and climb back into the series, giving themselves a chance at evening the series Tuesday.",
      "Strangely, the road team has won each of the first games and the Knicks have won six of seven on the road this postseason, their only loss coming at Boston as last year's champions briefly delayed a second-round exit by winning Game 5.",
      "\u201cI think we have to continue to fly around (defensively),\u201d Knicks All-Star guard Jalen Brunson said Monday. \u201cObviously, we don't want to have breakdowns and when we do, we've got to continue to slide and help each other out, giving my team more opportunities to shoot the ball and score the ball instead of turning the ball over I think will be a big key for us.\u201d",
      "Coach Tom Thibodeau's chess moves could be crucial, too. After benching Josh Hart in favor of starting Mitchell Robinson in Game 3, Hart and Towns played key roles in the fourth-quarter rally as Brunson was stuck in foul trouble.",
      "But Towns and Hart appeared to suffer knee injuries Sunday. Thibodeau remains hopeful both will be available \u2014 and play well \u2014 Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cI don't know if you're aware but our medical team has been voted the best in the league,\" Thibodeau said, drawing laughter. \u201cThey are tough-minded and I think at this time of year, the mental toughness is probably more important than the physical toughness and both of those guys are mentally tough.\u201d",
      "But the Pacers have been here before.",
      "Just two weeks ago after winning the first two conference semifinal games at Cleveland, they lost to the desperate Cavaliers at home before Haliburton and the Pacers rebounded with a shooting clinic and beat Cleveland in Game 4 before closing out the series on the road.",
      "Could it happen again?",
      "The Knicks prevented Indiana from implementing its usually track-like tempo, outscoring the Pacers 22-8 in transition while limiting them to 5-for-25 shooting from 3-point range. The Pacers have their own injury concern with Aaron Nesmith, their top defender who has primarily been paired against Brunson, who sprained his right ankle Sunday.",
      "\u201cAaron is sore as is to be expected,\u201d Carlisle said Monday. \u201cHe will be likely a game-time decision, probably listed as questionable and we've got to play better.\"",
      "Nobody understands it better than Haliburton, who will have plenty of motivation Tuesday.",
      "His father, John, will be watching from a Gainbridge Fieldhouse suite \u2014 the first game he has attended in person since being banned following his run onto the court after Indiana closed out the first-round series against Milwaukee. And, of course, he has something to prove again as the Pacers try to position themselves for a second straight series-clinching victory at Madison Square Garden.",
      "\u201cI didn't do a good job getting downhill and making plays,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cI've got to do a better job there. I think I've relied a lot down the stretch of games getting guys in the right positions and I feel like I didn't do, personally, a great job with that. Execution down the stretch, we definitely can be better and that starts with me.\u201d",

      "Indianapolis 500 runner-up Marcus Ericsson was penalized to the rear of the 33-car field along with Andretti Global teammate Kyle Kirkwood on Monday",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis 500 runner-up Marcus Ericsson was penalized to the rear of the 33-car field along with Andretti Global teammate Kyle Kirkwood on Monday after their cars were found to have unapproved modifications in the post-race inspection that could have helped their aerodynamic efficiency.",
      "Ericsson finished second to Alex Palou on Sunday when he was unable to make a winning pass in the closing laps. He now will be credited with a 31st-place finish while Kirkwood, who had finished sixth, has been relegated to 32nd.",
      "\u201cWe are in receipt of the Indianapolis 500 Post-Race Notice as provided by IndyCar,\" Andretti Global said in a statement. \u201cWe are taking the necessary time to assess the information and we will be requesting a full review with IndyCar.\u201d",
      "IndyCar said the modifications made by Andretti Global were to the Energy Management System covers provided by Dallara, the company that provides the chassis for the series. The rulebook states that those parts must be used as supplied.",
      "Ericsson and Kirkwood had to forfeit their prize money and championship points from their original finish, and instead will receive the money and points for their penalized finish. Each of the cars also was fined $100,000 and the competition managers for the teams have been suspended for the upcoming race on the streets of Detroit.",
      "It was an incredibly costly swing for Andretti as the Indy 500 purse this year was a record $20,283,000, with winner Palou set to receive $3.8 million. Ericsson will receive $610,500 for finishing 31st when he could have earned up to a $1 million in second.",
      "Kirkwood initially was credited with a sixth-place finish, but once dropped to 32nd received $607,500.",
      "\u201cWe had a great race, we came across the line in sixth,\u201d Kirkwood said. \u201cWe'll go through the (review) process and this team is built on sportsmanship, they are built on integrity and we'll try to do everything right in the future.\u201d",
      "The disqualifications changed the podium finishing order, with David Malukas of A.J. Foyt Racing moving up to second and Pato O'Ward of Arrow McLaren moving up to third. For the Foyt team, combined with Santino Ferrucci's adjusted fifth-place finish, it marked the best Indy 500 finish in 25 years for the team.",
      "The No. 90 car of Callum Ilott also failed post-race technical inspection after it failed to meet the minimum endplate height and location specification. Prema Racing was handed the same penalties as Andretti Global, which means rather than 12th, Ilott will be credited with finishing last in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d Ilott posted on social media after learning of the penalty. His payout was decreased to $155,300. \u201cI was at brunch and it was ruined.\u201d",
      "Ilott's teammate at Prema, rookie Robert Shwartzman, was named top rookie of the race after becoming the first rookie to win the pole since 1983. Ilott joked he was almost late to the awards ceremony because he was searching for Shwartzman for a loan to pay the IndyCar fine.",
      "Prema said in a statement that Ilott's front wing endplate did not meet minimum height and passed technical inspection multiple times.",
      "\u201cThe issue didn't lead to any performance gain, the car ended up being non-compliant with the rules at the end of the race, so the team accepts full responsibility,\u201d Prema said. \u201cThe team is currently investigating the root of the problem. We look forward to implementing the needed procedures to ensure improved control and avoid these kinds of issues in the future.\u201d",
      "Doug Boles, the president of IndyCar and Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said at the annual Monday night awards ceremony that Ericsson, Kirkwood and Ilott were all given the opportunity to skip the event but showed anyway.",
      "\u201cTo a man, Marcus, Kyle and Callum, all said \u2018We would not miss an opportunity to come to the victory banquet for the greatest race on earth,\u2019\u201d Boles said. \"And that tells you the character of the drivers who are in the cars in the IndyCar Series.\u201d",
      "Ericsson, already devastated by his second runner-up finish in the biggest race of the world, said the disqualification was another blow.",
      "\"I don't know the details enough, it's so fresh and the team is reviewing it all,\" Ericsson said before the awards ceremony. \u201cIt's obviously very harsh penalties, but if that's the rules, then that's the rules. We respect the integrity of the sport.\u201d",
      "IndyCar's inspection process came under scrutiny a week before the race, when the Team Penske cars of two-time winner Josef Newgarden and Will Power were found to have had unapproved modifications to the rear shock-absorbing attenuator.",
      "Newgarden and Power were unable to compete in the second round of qualifying, and instead had to start in the final row of the 11-row grid. Newgarden ended up having a fuel pump issue and finished 25th and Power finished 19th, though both of them will move up three spots following the penalties to Andretti Global and Prema Racing.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment that I think we all can use to move forward because in our most difficult times is when true character is shown,\u201d Boles said. \u201cAs a community, we're going to get stronger. We're going to get better. We're going to show everyone why we had 7 million viewers watch this Indy 500.\u201d",

      "Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark has a left quad strain and will be out at least two weeks",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark will miss at least two weeks after straining her left quadriceps during Saturday's 90-88 loss to the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty.",
      "Coach Stephanie White told reporters Monday she wasn't sure exactly when Clark was injured but was told after the game she had \u201csomething going on with her leg.\u201d An MRI confirmed the diagnosis. Clark's absence could wind up being a big blow for one of the league's title favorites.",
      "\u201cObviously, she wants to play and, obviously, everyone wants to see her play,\u201d White said following Monday's practice. \u201cBut for me, it's about maintaining perspective. It's making sure that we address this that doesn't affect the long term, that we take care of it and don't overpush, don't overexert.\u201d",
      "Clark was not seen with her teammates at the end of practice and was not available for comment. Team officials said additional updates will be provided as circumstances warrant.",
      "It's the first time in Clark's career she's missed a game after playing in all 40 games and both playoff games last season and the first four games this year. She did miss Indiana's first preseason game this year with a leg injury.",
      "Last season's WNBA rookie of the year finished with 18 points and 10 assists Saturday but lost the ball on Indiana's final possession as she tried to take a 3-pointer that could have won the game in the waning seconds.",
      "Afterward, White complained that New York was not called for a foul. Clark is averaging 19.0 points, 9.3 assists and 6.0 rebounds this season as the Fever have opened with a 2-2 mark. Indiana returns to action Wednesday at Washington and Clark is expected to miss that game as well as home contests against Connecticut and Washington and Indiana's rematch at Chicago on June 7 against Clark's rival, Angel Reese.",
      "The league's top drawing player could miss additional time, but the Fever seem more capable of winning without Clark this season after using the offseason to bring in a large group of veteran players with championship experience.",
      "It's unclear just how the Fever will try to replace Clark's play-making ability.",
      "\u201cSometimes great players don't tell you when they're hurting,\u201d White said. \u201cI'm glad that she did because we need to nip this in the bud.\u201d",
      "Clark set a single-season league record last season with 337 assists after leading the Iowa Hawkeyes to back-to-back national runner-up finishes in college.",

    "story": [
      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world\u2019s leading scientific power \u2014 and has led to the invention of cell phones and the internet as well as new ways to treat cancer, heart disease and strokes, noted Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the journal Science.",
      "But today that system is being shaken.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.",
      "The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation\u2019s by 55%.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people\u2019s priorities and continue our innovative dominance,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.",
      "Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold.",
      "Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. \u2014 but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.",
      "\u201cThere are threats to science ... south of the border,\u201d said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada\u2019s leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the \u201cCanada Leads\u201d recruitment drive. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.\u201d",
      "Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends \u201cto enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.\u201d She spoke at the launch of the bloc's \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d \u2014 which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.",
      "Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution\u2019s \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program.",
      "\u201cOur American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,\" he said of applicants. \"What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.\"",
      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d \u2014 139 out of 300 total \u2014 came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.",
      "U.S.-based applicants in this year\u2019s recruitment round for France\u2019s Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.",
      "At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program \u2014 aimed at young female researchers \u2014 drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.",
      "Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.",
      "Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., \u201cwe are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.\u201d",
      "Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.",
      "Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he\u2019s applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,\u201d said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "But it\u2019s not easy to pick up and move a scientific career \u2014 let alone a life.",
      "Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. She said it felt like \u201cAmerica as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.\u201d",
      "Still, she wasn\u2019t sure of her next move. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,\u201d she said.",
      "The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide \u201cChoose Europe\u201d initiative.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.",
      "Even as universities and institutes think about recruiting talent from the U.S., there\u2019s more apprehension than glee at the funding cuts.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status.

      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers working for Russian military intelligence targeted Western technology and logistics companies involved in shipping assistance to Ukraine, the U.S. National Security Agency said.",
      "The hackers were trying to obtain details about the type of assistance entering Ukraine and, as part of the effort, sought access to the feeds of internet-connected cameras near Ukrainian border crossings, according to the NSA's report on the cyberattack, which was issued late Wednesday.",
      "The cyber campaign sought to penetrate defense, transportation and logistics companies in several Western countries, including the U.S., as well as ports, airports and rail systems. The report didn\u2019t specify which types of aid Russia was surveilling, but Ukraine\u2019s allies have contributed significant amounts of military and humanitarian assistance since the war began.",
      "More than 10,000 internet-connected cameras were targeted, including private devices and public traffic cameras near critical transportation points, such as ports, rail hubs or border crossings. Most were in Ukraine, though some were in Romania, Poland and other eastern or central European countries.",
      "Officials did not disclose details about the hackers' success or how long they remained unnoticed. The activity detailed in the report began in 2022, the same year that Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Russia is expected to continue its efforts to spy on aid shipments, and companies involved in aid logistics or shipments should be on guard, according to the report, which was issued jointly by the NSA, the FBI and security agencies in several allied nations.",
      "\u201cTo defend against and mitigate these threats, at-risk entities should anticipate targeting,\u201d the NSA said.",
      "Authorities linked the activity to a Russian military intelligence unit dubbed \u201cFancy Bear\u201d that is well known for its past campaigns targeting the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The hackers used a variety of tactics to gain access, including spearphishing, which involves sending authentic-looking messages to a potential victim that contain links to harmful software or requests for sensitive information.",
      "The Russian team also exploited security vulnerabilities in computer devices used at small and in-home offices, networks that often lack the security measures found in larger systems.",
      "The hackers didn't use particularly innovative techniques, according to Grant Geyer, chief strategy officer at the cybersecurity company Claroty. Nevertheless, the sprawling yet carefully orchestrated effort gives the Russians a \u201cgranular understanding\u201d of the aid sent to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have done detailed targeting across the entire supply chain to understand what equipment is moving, when and how \u2014 whether it\u2019s by aircraft, ship or rail,\u201d Geyer said.",
      "Russia could use the information it obtained to hone its war planning, Geyer said, or to plot further cyber or physical attacks on the supply chain to Ukraine.",
      "Last fall, U.S. intelligence officials issued a public bulletin directing American defense companies and suppliers to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",

      "It\u2019s not an official holiday \u2013 yet \u2013 but for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day\u201d is still special",
      "It\u2019s not an official holiday \u2013 yet \u2013 but for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day\u201d is still special. Thursday marks the 15th anniversary of the first known use of cryptocurrency to buy real-world goods.",
      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",

      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",

Harlem, NYC & America are better today because of his service. May he forever rest in power,\" Jeffries posted on X.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted to X on Monday that Rangel \"was a great man, a great friend, and someone who never stopped fighting for his constituents and the best of America.\"",
      "\"The list of his accomplishments could take pages, but he leaves the world a much better place than he found it,\" Schumer said.",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, called Rangel \"an impactful legislator and a lifelong voice for the voiceless and champion of the oppressed.\"",

      "Sangrok Oh, a Korean crypto investor and entrepreneur, told ABC News on Friday that he and other top investors had been invited to tour the White House Friday afternoon, though it was not clear to him whether Trump himself would meet them.",
      "\"So, we're going to visit and tour the White House [and] at the same time talk about crypto industries and the future of crypto,\" Oh said.",
      "Thursday night's black tie event, held at Trump's Washington-area golf club, was attended by around 200 cryptocurrency traders, including many from overseas, who gained admission through a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors in Trump's meme coin -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.",
      "Critics have blasted the gala as a \"pay for play\" event in which investors who poured millions into Trump's crypto coin got special access to the president.",
      "News that top $TRUMP coin investors visited the White House appeared to contradict White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion Thursday that the president was attending the crypto gala in a personal capacity, and that since the dinner did not take place at the White House, it was separate from his official duties.",
      "\"The president is attending [the dinner] in his personal time,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Cherry Hsu, an executive at MemeCore, a Singapore-based blockchain startup, said the firm's founder, known publicly as \"Ice,\" had also been invited to the White House on Friday afternoon. MemeCore, according to the contest leaderboard, finished second in the competition with $TRUMP coin holdings in excess of $1 million.",
      "And late Friday, Justin Sun, a Chinese crupto mogul and the top investor in Trump's meme coin, posted a highly produced video of his White House tour, writing on X, \"Was an honor to be invited to tour the @WhiteHouse. Such a privilege to see it in person.\"",
      "In addition to his multimillion-dollar investment in the $TRUMP coin, Sun has also invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another Trump-backed crypto venture. One month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun.",
      "The Trump meme coin's website at one point earlier this month advertised a \"Special VIP White House tour\" for the top 25 meme coin holders as part of the contest -- but as of last week, the site said only that a \"Special VIP tour\" would be arranged, without mentioning the White House.",
      "The site also included a disclaimer saying the tour was being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself would be appearing as a \"guest.\"",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman \u2013 both of whom joined Trump on his recent trip to the Middle East \u2013 helmed their respective companies as each invested in Figure. OpenAI ended its partnership with Figure last year.",
      "\u201cTrump is talking about bringing back the jobs, and he\u2019s not understanding the tension between that goal and automation, which the tech bros have enthusiasm for,\u201d Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University and a former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, told ABC News. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental conflict between those goals.\u201d",

      "\"New jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, every job will be changed,\" Huang said. \"Remember, it's not AI that's going to take your job. It's not AI that's going to destroy your company. It's the company and the person who uses AI that's going to take your job. And so that's something to internalize.\"",

      "A key reason for the tariffs, White House officials say: Reshoring factories and rejuvenating employment in the manufacturing industry.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this month in an interview with Fox News that Trump's vision for ushering in a \"golden age\" for America involved enticing manufacturers to open factories and build in the United States.",
      "\"We're going to have huge jobs in manufacturing. You've heard the president talk about trillions and trillions of factories being built in America,\" he said in the interview on May 11.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, White House Spokesperson Kush Desai said \"the importance of President Trump\u2019s push to reinvigorate American industry goes beyond creating good-paying jobs for everyday Americans.\"",
      "\"Supply chain shocks of critical pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and semiconductors during the COVID era prove that America cannot rely on foreign imports. The Trump administration remains committed to reshoring manufacturing that\u2019s critical to our national and economic security with a multifaceted approach of tariffs, tax cuts, rapid deregulation, and domestic energy production,\" Desai added.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in manufacturing has plummeted for decades. Roughly 8% of U.S. workers currently hold positions in manufacturing, which marks a steep decline from about a quarter of all employees as recently as 1970.",
      "Researchers attribute such decline to overlapping trends, including the offshoring of manufacturing to low-wage markets overseas and the adoption of labor-saving technology throughout the sector.",
      "Long before current advances, automation significantly increased productivity in U.S. factories, meaning the same number of workers could produce many more goods, researchers at Ball State University found in 2015. As a result, they said, manufacturing employment stagnated for decades even as output climbed.",

      "Discordant views among some tech leaders and White House officials surfaced in April, when Musk sharply criticized tariff-advocate Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. Navarro, Musk said, is \u201ctruly a moron.\u201d",
      "In an interview with CNBC, Navarro responded, saying Musk \"isn't a car manufacturer \u2014 he's a car assembler.\u201d",
      "To be sure, analysts said, automation in manufacturing would likely continue regardless of support from Trump\u2019s tech allies, since producers are locked in a competition to lower costs and increase output. The precise outlook for manufacturing employment is unclear, they added, since additional technology may add jobs for those maintaining and optimizing the machinery.",

      "Republicans are using a budgeting tactic called reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass, to get the package through both chambers and to Trump's desk. But any changes in the Senate would require the bill to go back to the House, where it was passed by only one vote among a divided Republican conference last week.",
      "Speaker Johnson made the rounds on the Sunday talk shows this week to defend the bill and to encourage the Senate to pass it without too many changes.",
      "\"I encourage them, you know, to do their work, of course, as we all anticipate. But to make as few modifications to this package as possible, because remembering that we've got to pass it one more time to ratify their changes in the House,\" Johnson told \"State of the Union.\" \"And I have a very delicate balance here, very delicate equilibrium that we've reached over a long period of time. And it's best not to meddle with it too much.\"",
      "The speaker emphasized the need to expedite the bill's passage and expressed hope that the president could sign it by Independence Day.",

      "But Sen. Johnson criticized the rushed process, saying, \"You have to do the work, which takes time. That's part of the problem. The problem here is we've rushed this process. We haven't taken the time. We've done the same old way, exempted most programs.\"",
      "Another issue with the bill in the Senate is that it raises the debt ceiling, which some GOP senators said they wanted to deal with separately rather than add it to the package that cuts spending and makes Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he won't vote for the legislation unless the debt ceiling increase is stripped because he said it would \"explode deficits.\"",

      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs may be able to survive a legal challenge, thanks in part to a Japanese zipper company that sued the Nixon administration 50 years ago.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Donald Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs -- basing his ruling on the precedent from a 1970s court case -- but stopped short of issuing an order affirming the president's right to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "In a largely technical ruling issued on Tuesday, U.S. Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred one of the first lawsuits challenging Trump's tariffs to a different federal court while also weighing in on the legality of the controversial tariffs. Florida-based planner company Emily Ley Paper sued over the tariffs in April, asking Wetherell to invalidate them because Trump lacks the power to impose tariffs himself.",
      "According to the judge, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 gives Trump the authority to set tariffs for reasons other than raising revenue. Wetherell wrote that Trump's justification for the tariffs -- both stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the country and resolving a trade imbalance -- is sufficient to satisfy the terms set by Congress.",
      "\"This is a civil action commenced against the United States and it 'arises out of' a federal law\u2014IEEPA\u2014so the dispositive question framed by the parties' filings is whether IEEPA 'provid[es] for \u2026 tariffs,'\" he wrote. \"Defendants contend that it does; Plaintiffs contend that it doesn't.

Lawyers challenging the tariffs have argued that Trump's interpretation of the law oversteps his authority by treading into an issue controlled by Congress, but the Trump administration has pointed judges to a court decision related to the IEEPA's legal predecessor -- the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- to guide the way.",

      "According to Wetherell, the same reasoning would apply 50 years later to the IEEPA, meaning Trump has the power to impose tariffs without the help of Congress. \"The reasoning in Yoshida is persuasive, and the Court sees no reason why it would not apply to IEEPA because the operative language of IEEPA is identical to the operative language in TWEA,\" the judge wrote.",

      "It\u2019s the last day to book a flight on Southwest Airlines without being hit with a fee to check bags after the airline abandoned a decades-long luggage policy",
      "It's the last day to book a flight on Southwest Airlines without being hit with a fee to check bags after the airline abandoned a decades-long luggage policy that executives had described last fall as key to differentiating the budget carrier from its rivals.",
      "The airline announced the change in March, saying at the time that the the new policy would start with flights booked on Wednesday.",
      "Southwest had built years of advertising campaigns around its policy of letting passengers check up to two bags for free. Under its new policy, people who haven\u2019t either reached the upper tiers of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, bought a business class ticket or hold the airline\u2019s credit card will have to pay for checked bags.",
      "Southwest will continue to offer two free checked bags to Rapid Rewards A-List preferred members and customers traveling on Business Select fares, and one free checked bag to A-List members and other select customers. Passengers with Rapid Rewards credit cards will receive a credit for one checked bag.",
      "People who don\u2019t qualify for those categories will get charged to check bags. The airline said in March that it also would roll out a new, basic fare on its lowest priced tickets when the change takes effect.",
      "The airline estimated in September that charging bag fees would bring in about $1.5 billion a year but cost the airline $1.8 billion in lost business from customers who chose to fly Southwest because of its generous baggage allowance.",
      "Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its new checked bag fees, but most major airlines typically charge between $35 and $40 for checked bags.",
      "Another policy that will take effect on Wednesday is Southwest requiring passengers to keep their portable chargers in plain sight while using them because of concerns about the growing number of lithium-ion battery fires.",
      "These aren't the only changes at Southwest. The Dallas airline previously announced that it was leaving behind another Southwest tradition, the open-boarding system it has used for more than 50 years. Southwest expects to begin operating flights with passengers in assigned seats next year.",
      "The airline also said last year that it would charge customers extra for more legroom and offer red-eye flights.",
      "Southwest has struggled recently and is under pressure from activist investors to boost profits and revenue. The airline reached a truce in October with hedge fund Elliott Investment Management to avoid a proxy fight, but Elliott won several seats on the company's board.",
      "The airline announced in February that it was eliminating 1,750 jobs, or 15% of its corporate workforce, in the first major layoffs in the company\u2019s 53-year history.",

      "When President Donald Trump directed his attorney general last month to investigate campaign fundraising, he cited concerns that foreigners and \u201cmalign actors\u201d were laundering illegal contributions to U.S. politicians through the internet",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump directed his attorney general last month to investigate online fundraising, he cited concerns that foreigners and fraudsters were using elaborate \u201cschemes\u201c and \"dummy accounts\u201d to funnel illegal contributions to politicians and causes.",
      "Instead of calling for an expansive probe, however, the president identified just one potential target: ActBlue, the Democrats\u2019 online fundraising juggernaut, which has acknowledged receiving over 200 potentially illicit contributions last year from foreign internet addresses.",
      "Trump's announcement contained a glaring omission \u2014 his political committees also received scores of potentially problematic contributions.",
      "An Associated Press review of donations to Trump over the past five years found 1,600 contributions from donors who live abroad, have close ties to foreign interests or failed to disclose basic information, often making it difficult, if not impossible, to identify them and verify the legality of their donations Among those was $5,000 linked to a derelict building, and $5,000 from a Chinese businessman who listed a La Quinta Inn as his address. Another sizable donation \u2014 $1 million \u2014 was made by the wife of an African oil and mining magnate.",
      "It\u2019s against the law for U.S. candidates and political committees to accept contributions from foreign nationals. Laws also place strict limits on donation amounts and prohibit the laundering of contributions to get around legal caps. For the most part, such donations have been policed by campaigns and the Federal Election Commission, with only the most egregious examples being targeted by federal law enforcement.",
      "But after reclaiming the White House, Trump embarked on a campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies, launching broadsides against universities, law firms and his own former officials. If the Justice Department were to investigate ActBlue, it could imperil a key fundraising tool for Trump\u2019s political rivals before the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans\u2019 threadbare House majority \u2014 and the president's ability to pass an agenda through Congress \u2014 will be on the line.",
      "\u201cThis is him taking direct aim at the center of Democratic and progressive fundraising to hamstring his political opponents,\u201d said Ezra Reese, an attorney who leads the political law division at the Elias Law Group, a leading Democratic firm that does not represent ActBlue. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that they picked their target first. He\u2019s not even pretending.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about Trump's fundraising, including what sort of fraud prevention measures his committees have in place. Instead, a senior administration official pointed to the findings of a recent House Republican investigation of ActBlue that the White House alleges \u201cuncovered specific evidence of potentially unlawful conduct.\u201d",
      "\"The memorandum directs the attorney general to investigate this matter broadly, and she will follow the evidence and take appropriate action as warranted,\u201d said the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter.",
      "Neither the Justice Department nor Trump's 2024 campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita responded to requests for comment.",
      "U.S. citizens living abroad are free to donate to politicians back home. But it can be difficult even for campaigns to discern who is allowed to give and whether a person may be serving as a \"straw\" donor for someone else seeking to influence U.S. elections.",
      "The AP identified only two Trump donors out of more than 200 living abroad whose U.S. citizenship was listed as \u201cverified\u201d in the president's campaign finance reports. He received over 1,000 contributions from 150 donors who omitted key identifying details such as their city, state, address or country. Trump also received at least 90 contributions from people who did not give a full name, are listed as \u201canonymous\u201d or whose donations include the notation \u201cname not provided.\u201d",
      "Many of these Trump donors contributed through WinRed, the Republicans' online fundraising platform that is the GOP\u2019s answer to ActBlue. Only about three dozen of these contributions were rejected, most of which came from an unknown source and were paid in cryptocurrency, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "WinRed officials did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cForeign money in our elections is a legitimate concern,\u201d said Dan Weiner, a former Federal Election Commission attorney who is now director of the Brennan Center\u2019s elections and government program. \u201cWhat\u2019s not legitimate is to single out one political opponent and pretend the problem is limited to them.\u201d",
      "Jiajun \u201cJack\u201d Zhang, for example, is a jet-setting Chinese businessman whose Qingdao Scaffolding Co. boasts of being one of the \u201cbiggest manufacturers and suppliers in China\u201d of scaffolding. In October, he used WinRed to donate $5,000 to Trump, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "Zhang lives in China\u2019s Shandong province, according to his LinkedIn account, and is described in French business filings as a Chinese national. But his contribution to Trump lists a La Quinta Inn in Hawaiian Gardens, California, as his address, records show. The donation was made around the time that Zhang posted a photo on social media of his family visiting Disneyland, which is near the hotel.",
      "Zhang did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Other potentially troublesome donations include four from unnamed donors listing an address of \u201c999 Anonymous Dr.\u201d",
      "There is also a series of contributions made through WinRed that listed the donor's address as a vacant building in Washington that was formerly a funeral home. The donor, identified only as \u201cAlex, A\u201d on Trump\u2019s campaign finance report, gave nearly $5,000, spread across more than 40 separate transactions last year. Those types of donations tend to draw scrutiny from campaigns and regulators.",
      "Regulators and watchdogs have also long been concerned about donations from individuals with ties to foreign interests. Trump has received many such contributions, including one in December from Nnenna Peters, the wife of Benedict Peters, a Nigerian billionaire who is the founder and CEO of oil and mining businesses.",
      "Nnenna Peters, who goes by Ella, gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. A naturalized citizen, Nnenna Peters \u2014 who lives in Potomac, Maryland, a tony suburb of the capital \u2014 is allowed to make campaign donations.",
      "Federal law, however, bars U.S. citizens from making contributions on behalf of a noncitizen spouse if the money is not a shared asset. For example, experts said, a husband could be prohibited from making a campaign donation using funds from a checking account solely in his wife\u2019s name.",
      "In practice, such a prohibition is hard to enforce because it is difficult to assess whether spouses are acting on their own accord or on behalf of significant others. Government watchdogs say donations like these raise the risk of an attempt to influence U.S. policy on behalf of a foreign interest.",
      "That was precisely the kind of problem Trump cited in his executive order that singled out ActBlue.",
      "Benedict Peters, as it turns out, has a lot to offer that could be of interest to Trump, who has made the extraction of natural resources a focus on his second administration. In particular, the Trump administration has sought to secure access to critical minerals that help power modern technology. Peters\u2019 Aiteo Group markets itself as one of the largest energy conglomerates in Nigeria, while his company, Bravura Holdings, purports to hold the rights to vast critical mineral deposits across Africa.",
      "His wife\u2019s donation stands out in light of her past giving: She donated exclusively to Democrats, records show, including a $66,800 contribution to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.",
      "\u201cThis clearly could have come from her husband,\u201d said Craig Holman, a registered lobbyist for Public Citizen, a Washington-based government watchdog group. \u201cThis is something the FEC should take a very, very close look at.\u201d",
      "Benedict and Ella Peters did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The questionable donations fit a pattern for Trump, who has in the past exhibited indifference toward campaign finance rules and used his presidential powers to assist those facing legal trouble in such matters.",
      "In January, Trump\u2019s Justice Department dropped its case against former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Nebraska Republican accused of accepting a $30,000 contribution from a Nigerian billionaire. During his first term, Trump pardoned conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza and Republican donor Michael Liberty, who were both convicted of using straw donors to evade contribution limits. He also pardoned former California Rep. Duncan Hunter, who was convicted in 2020 of stealing $250,000 from his campaign fund.",
      "Trump's political efforts have also drawn contributions from straw donors and foreigners who have been subjected to legal scrutiny.",
      "Among them is Barry Zekelman, a Canadian steel industry billionaire, who was fined $975,000 in 2022 by the Federal Election Commission for funneling $1.75 million to America First Action, Trump's official super PAC, in 2018. The contribution helped Zekelman secure a dinner with Trump at which steel tariffs were discussed.",
      "Two Soviet-born U.S. citizens, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were convicted in a straw donor scheme that funneled $325,000 to the same super PAC in the runup to Trump's losing 2020 reelection campaign.",
      "Jesse Benton, a Republican political operative, was convicted in 2022 of serving as a straw donor for a Russian businessman who contributed $25,000 to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.",
      "Democrats say Trump\u2019s focus on ActBlue is a lot to stomach in light of Trump\u2019s acceptance of questionable donations and his seeming lack of interest in enforcing campaign finance laws more generally. They noted that Trump in February fired a commissioner at the Federal Election Commission. The firing, followed by the resignation of a Republican commissioner, has denied the agency the quorum necessary to enforce campaign finance laws and regulations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s telling that while Trump and his allies attack grassroots-funded platforms like ours, their own campaigns have welcomed money from questionable sources,\u201d ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said.",
      "Republicans counter that there is well-founded reason to investigate the Democratic platform, which eased some fraud detection protocols in 2024 before the presidential election.",
      "There is, however, a political upside to investigating ActBlue. The platform has proved more successful than WinRed, the Republican platform designed to imitate it, which took in less than half of the $3.8 billion that ActBlue raised during the 2024 election cycle.",
      "ActBlue representatives declined to say whether they have been contacted by the Justice Department.",
      "ActBlue is expected to battle any investigation. It took a different approach when a Republican-led congressional committee launched an investigation in 2023. That committee\u2019s findings turned out to be the basis for some of the allegations cited by Trump in his executive order.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, are preparing for the worst.",
      "\u201cThere is a pervasive fear that ActBlue could cease to exist,\u201d said Matt Hodges, a veteran Democratic operative who served as the director of engineering for Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst fear people have \u2014 that this will escalate or drain legal resources that hinder their ability to operate.\u201d",
      "He predicted that the Democrats could lose more than $10 million in the short term if ActBlue were forced to shut down. That has led some Democrats to begin thinking about alternatives, but they acknowledged it might be too late to create something as successful as ActBlue with the midterms around the corner.",

      "Some of the most unique living things in the world \u2014 plants that supplement the nutrients they get from sunlight by digesting ants, flies and spiders \u2014 are only found in a small part of North and South Carolina",
      "CAROLINA BEACH, N.C. -- Park ranger Jesse Anderson leads dozens of people on a weekly hike in North Carolina to see some of the most unique living things in the world \u2014 plants that supplement the nutrients they get from sunlight by digesting ants, flies and spiders.",
      "But the Venus flytraps aren't like the human-size, ravenous and cruel Audrey in \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201d",
      "In the wild, Venus flytraps are the size of a lima bean and pose no harm to anything other than insects. Their special hairs snap their leaves together when brushed \u2014 but only twice in about 20 seconds or less to reduce the amount of false alarms by dust or rain.",
      "Once inside, the insect is doomed to become plant food, Anderson said.",
      "\u201cIt continues to trigger those hairs and the trap slowly closes and eventually starts releasing digestive enzymes to start breaking down the insect. And because they\u2019re in nutrient-poor environments, they supplement their food with insects,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "Anderson's hike at Carolina Beach State Park on the southeast North Carolina coast also showcases other carnivorous plants. There are vase-shaped pitcher plants with liquid at the bottom that traps insects, then digests them. Butterworts and sundews attract insects with glistening leaves, then secrete an adhesive to trap them in place. Bladderworts work similarly to Venus flytraps.",
      "And the hike is one of the few places to see Venus flytraps. The plant only grows in 12 counties in southeast North Carolina near Wilmington and a few nearby places in South Carolina, which made the organism the state's official carnivorous plant in 2023.",
      "Now is an especially good time to take that hike. Venus flytraps bloom from about mid-May to mid-June, Anderson said.",
      "The flytrap is a fragile plant that needs fire to survive. Wildfires in the pine forests where they grow clear off the denser overgrowth to provide the abundant sunlight the plants need.",
      "They face two big enemies \u2014 poachers and development.",
      "Harvesting the plants without permission is a felony in North Carolina and a misdemeanor in South Carolina. In 2016, a man was sentenced to 17 months in prison for taking nearly 1,000 Venus flytraps from game land in Hampstead, North Carolina.",
      "And the flytraps live in one of the fastest-growing parts of the U.S., where neighborhoods and businesses have been built over their habitats. Most of the plants can now be found in preserves and other undisturbed areas.",
      "Scientists counted only about 300,000 flytraps in the Carolinas several years ago.",
      "While Anderson's hike is one of the few ways to see Venus flytraps in their natural environment, he said commercially grown plants can be found around in greenhouses and plant stores around the world and can thrive in homes in the right conditions",
      "\u201cThey like nutrient-poor soils, and also they can\u2019t stand typical well water or tap water. So they need things like rainwater or distilled water or versus osmosis,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "Venus flytraps need abundant sunlight and soils that are moist but not drenched. And they don't have to eat bugs if they can get enough nutrients from photosynthesis.",
      "Please don't feed them hamburger meat \u2014 that's not what they eat. And try not to trigger the leaves shut without something to digest. That takes a lot of energy the plant needs to replace.",

      "Authorities say they\u2019ve captured three more of the 10 escapees who broke out of a New Orleans jail, leaving two more on the run",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Three more of the 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier this month were re-arrested Monday in two different states after more than a week on the lam, authorities said.",
      "One of the men was arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by local police and two others were arrested in Walker County, Texas, by officials there, Louisiana State Police posted on the platform X.",
      "Two more inmates are still on the run, state police said. No other details were immediately released about Monday's arrests.",
      "Authorities have been scouring the New Orleans area for the men after they escaped in an audacious May 16 jailbreak. The men yanked open a faulty cell door inside a jail, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the coverage of darkness.",
      "The inmates\u2019 absence wasn\u2019t discovered until a morning headcount, hours after they bolted for freedom. Graffiti left on the wall included the message \u201cTo Easy LoL,\u201d with an arrow pointing to the gap.",
      "City and state officials have pointed to multiple security lapses in the jail.",
      "Louisiana authorities named the latest inmates who were recaptured as Lenton Vanburen, Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald. Jail escapees Dkenan Dennis, Corey Boyd, Gary C. Price, Kendell Myles and Robert Moody were previously taken into custody by authorities.",
      "Many of the men were originally in the New Orleans jail awaiting sentences or trials for alleged violent crimes including murder.",
      "After the escape, a jail maintenance worker was arrested and accused of turning off the water to the toilet, an act authorities said helped the men get out. The worker said he had been threatened by one of the inmates if he refused to do so.",
      "In addition, four other people have been arrested for allegedly helping the inmates once they were on the loose.",

      "Former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, 53, was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced in March. But on Monday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that Jenkins and his family \u201chave been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.\"",
      "\u201cThis Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn\u2019t deserve to spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left \u201cmonsters,\u201d and \u201cleft for dead,\u201d Trump said in the post. \u201cHe will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.\"",

      "Jenkins took the stand in his own defense and said there was no connection between the payments he received and the badges he handed out, according to news reports.

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A wildfire swept through portions of a Civil War-era fort and historical site in southern New Mexico, forcing the evacuations of campgrounds and a horse ranch, authorities said Monday.",
      "The fire damaged structures at Fort Stanton Historical Site built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and a gym erected by Germans interned at the site during World War II after their ship sank.",
      "Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters joined efforts to contain a blaze that scorched more than a square mile (3 square kilometers) of terrain at the site and surrounding conservation lands managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management.",
      "Laura Rabon, a spokesperson for a multiagency team responding to the situation, said crews cleared lines of vegetation Monday on the north side of the wildfire and helicopters doused smoldering hot spots with water. The fire was contained along 4% of its boundary.",
      "The blaze at Fort Stanton is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away from communities at Ruidoso that were ravaged by wildfires last year when several hundred homes and businesses were destroyed. Those fires were followed by devastating flooding and erosion in scorched areas.",
      "Separately in Arizona, more than 500 firefighters and support personnel had largely contained the boundaries of a wildfire northeast of Tuscon, in the Santa Catalina Mountains, that has destroyed five homes in the community of Oracle.

      "Flamingos, pelicans, herons and parrots are just a few of the wild birds that call Miami home",
      "MIAMI -- Flamingos, pelicans, herons and parrots are just a few of the wild birds that call Miami home, but it\u2019s the roosters, hens and baby chicks that have come to rule the roost in recent years.",
      "Not only found in residential neighborhoods like Little Havana, Little Haiti and Wynwood, the fowl families are also making their home among the high-rises and government buildings downtown. And while some people find the crowing to be a nuisance, many have adopted the rooster as an unofficial mascot for the city.",
      "Paul George, the resident historian at HistoryMiami Museum, said the chickens are closely connected to the people who have moved to Miami over the decades. For a long time, the domesticated birds were mostly kept in backyards, but George began to notice their feral cousins wandering in public areas about 20 years ago.",
      "He said the chickens have a cultural connection to people who grew up in rural areas of Cuba and other parts of Latin America: \u201cThey\u2019ve always had these hens and roosters around.\u201d",
      "Wild chickens can be found in many Florida communities, from Key West to Tampa to St. Augustine, along with other large cities throughout the U.S., like New Orleans, Houston and Los Angeles.",
      "But Miami's Little Havana truly adopted the birds as a symbol in 2002 when 6-foot (2-meter) fiberglass rooster statues began appearing outside shops and restaurants along Calle Ocho, which is Spanish for 8th Street, as part of a campaign to celebrate the area's culture.",
      "More than two decades later, dozens of the colorfully painted statues, designed by the late artist Pedro Dami\u00e1n, continue to attract tourists seeking fun photo opportunities.",
      "Owner Jakelin Llaguna of Little Havana Visitors Center, a souvenir shop along Calle Ocho, said the community is largely fond of the avian inhabitants, which forage around local businesses and parks.",
      "\u201cThe neighbors have welcomed them,\u201d Llaguna said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t mind if they\u2019re in their backyard or in their front lawn. Nobody messes with them, they\u2019re our mascot.\u201d",
      "Llaguna said the roosters' crowing at sunrise symbolizes renewal.",
      "\u201cThe Cubans came to Little Havana when the revolution came into Cuba,\u201d Llaguna said. \u201cThey settled in this neighborhood, so they had a new beginning in Little Havana.\u201d",
      "Llaguna's store is filled with rooster merchandise, including shirts, hats, glasses and magnets.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants a rooster,\u201d Llaguna said. \u201cThey want to take home a memento. They want have a memory of a fun time. And the rooster has turned into that.\u201d",
      "As the feral roosters spread, they might soon face competition from the invasive peacocks that have taken over neighboring communities like Coconut Grove and Coral Gables.",
      "\u201cThe peacocks have very bad tempers,\u201d George said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty ill-mannered, and they tend to be a lot bigger than the chickens, and they make a lot of noise.\u201d",
      "But George is more concerned that development and gentrification in older neighborhoods could eventually lead to the disappearance of their feathered residents. When 50-year-old houses are replaced with brand new condos, George isn't sure whether people spending over $1 million for a home are going to tolerate the loud birds.",
      "\u201cEven with hurricane windows, I just don\u2019t think a lot of these people are gonna put up with it as the neighborhood becomes richer.\u201d George said. \u201cAnd I think they\u2019re gonna really lean on the city\u2019s code enforcement for it.\u201d",
      "The legal status of the roosters and chickens is somewhat murky. Both the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County have ordinances that either strictly regulate or completely ban live poultry in residential areas. Meanwhile, the birds freely roam downtown among offices, public parks and courthouses.",
      "Asked about the birds, both city and county officials described their presence as a code compliance issue and referred The Associated Press to their live animal ordinances.",
      "Little Havana resident Donato Ramos Mart\u00ednez enjoys having the roosters and chickens around and even feeds them near the Bay of Pigs Monument, off Calle Ocho.",
      "\u201cThe rooster is the perfect animal for someone to wake up, because they begin to crow at about 4 a.m., from 4 to 5 a.m.,\u201d Ramos Mart\u00ednez said in Spanish. \u201cAnd it is an attractive animal that tourists, both young and old, are excited about, and they take their picture, you know what I mean?\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so I don\u2019t understand,\u201d he added, \u201cwhy there are some \u2014 excuse my language \u2014 some idiots who don\u2019t want roosters or chickens or chicks on the street.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe will be closed Thursday 9-26-2024 due to impending weather,\u201d it reads. It promised to reopen the next day at noon, weather permitting.",
      "That impending weather was the remnants of Hurricane Helene. And that reopening still hasn't arrived.",

Chimney Rock, a hamlet of about 140 named for the 535-million-year-old geological wonder that underpins its tourism industry, was hit particularly hard.",
      "Eight months later, the mine, like most of the surviving businesses on the village\u2019s quaint Main Street, is still an open construction site. A flashing sign at the guard shack on the town line warns: \u201cROAD CLOSED. LOCAL TRAFFIC ONLY.\u201d",

Anybody that\u2019s shot a gun or bow and arrow knows, you don\u2019t always hit the target.\u201d",
      "The Broad River \u2014 which gave the restaurants and inns lining its banks their marketable water views \u2014 left its course, carving away foundations and sweeping away the bridge to Chimney Rock State Park. O\u2019Leary said about a third of the town\u2019s businesses were \u201ctotally destroyed.\u201d",
      "Several are gone for good.",
      "At the north end of town, all that remains of Bayou Billy\u2019s Chimney Rock Country Fair amusement park is a pile of twisted metal, tattered awnings and jumbled train cars. A peeling, cracked yellow carousel horse that owner Bill Robeson\u2019s own children once rode balances precariously on a debris pile, its mouth agape to the sky.",
      "At 71, Robeson \u2014 who also lost a two-story building where he sold popcorn, pizza and souvenir tin cups \u2014 said he doesn\u2019t have the heart to rebuild.",
      "\u201cWe made the dream come true and everything,\u201d said Robeson, who\u2019s been coming to Chimney Rock since he was in diapers. \u201cI hate I had to leave like it was. But, you know, life is short. You just can\u2019t ponder over it. You\u2019ve got to keep going, you know?\u201d",
      "At the other end of town, the Carter Lodge boasted \u201cBALCONIES OVERLOOKING RIVER.\u201d Much of the back side of the 19-room hotel now dangles in midair, an angry red-brown gash in the soil that once supported it.",
      "Barely a month before Helene, Linda Carter made the last loan payments on repairs from a 100-year flood in 1996. Contractors estimate it will cost $2.6 million to rebuild.",
      "So, the widow said she's waiting to see how much the federal government will offer her to let the lot become a flood-mitigation zone.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t have it in me,\u201d said Carter, who lived in the hotel. \u201cI\u2019m 74. I don\u2019t want to die and leave my children in debt. I also don\u2019t want to go through the pain of rebuilding.\u201d",

      "The Florida native fell in love with a fudge shop here during a vacation more than 30 years ago. Today, he and his family own four businesses in town, including the gem mine and the RiverWatch Bar & Grill.",
      "\u201cThe day after the storm, we didn\u2019t even question whether we were going to rebuild,\u201d Banz said, with workers rebuilding the riverfront deck on new cement footers. \u201cWe knew right away that we weren\u2019t going to let go.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Leary, Banz and others say federal relief has been slow. But volunteers have filled the gaps.",
      "Down the street, Amish workers from Pennsylvania pieced together a mold before pouring a new reinforced foundation for the Broad River Inn, among the oldest businesses in town. The river undermined the back end and obliterated the neighboring miniature golf course.",
      "\u201cWe definitely could not have done what we\u2019re doing without them, that is for certain,\u201d inn co-owner Kristen Sottile said. \u201cThey have brought so much willpower, hope, as well as many other things to our community.\u201d",
      "The Amish are working in concert with Spokes of Hope, a Christian nonprofit formed in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which hit the Carolinas in September 2018.",
      "Jonathan Graef and his siblings bought the Best View Inn in late 2023 and were halfway through renovations when Helene struck. They\u2019ve been flooded twice since, but the new rafters and framing the Amish workers constructed have held.",

      "Throughout town, the ring of hammers and saws mingles with the sizzle of welding and the rumble of debris-removal trucks.",
      "Workers lay sewer lines. A temporary steel bridge to the state park \u2014 replacing the ornate stone and concrete span that washed out \u2014 should be ready soon, O\u2019Leary said.",

      "One recent evening, Rose Senehi walked down Main Street, stopping to peer into shop windows to see how much progress had been made.",

      "The bridge is gone. So is that ice cream shop. But Senehi said there\u2019s more to this place than stores and treats.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about this area that, it\u2019s just compelling. The mountains. The green. It\u2019s just beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll definitely come back. And it won\u2019t be the same; it\u2019ll be better.\u201d",

      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley expressed regret that viewers of the film became so afraid of sharks, and both later contributed to conservation efforts as their populations declined, largely due to commercial fishing.",

      "The World War II bomber Heaven Can Wait was shot down off the Pacific island of New Guinea on March 11, 1944",
      "WAPPINGERS FALLS, N.Y. -- As the World War II bomber Heaven Can Wait was hit by enemy fire off the Pacific island of New Guinea on March 11, 1944, the co-pilot managed a final salute to flyers in an adjacent plane before crashing into the water.",
      "All 11 men aboard were killed. Their remains, deep below the vast sea, were designated as non-recoverable.",
      "Yet four crew members' remains are beginning to return to their hometowns after a remarkable investigation by family members and a recovery mission involving elite Navy divers who descended 200 feet (61 meters) in a pressurized bell to reach the sea floor.",
      "Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, the radio operator, was buried with military honors and community support on Saturday in his hometown of Wappingers Falls, New York, more than eight decades after leaving behind his wife and baby son.",
      "The bombardier, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, was to be buried Monday in Livermore, California, where he grew up in a ranching family. The remains of the pilot, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and navigator, 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick, will be interred in the coming months.",
      "The ceremonies are happening 12 years after one of Kelly's relatives, Scott Althaus, set out to solve the mystery of where exactly the plane went down.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so grateful,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s been an impossible journey \u2014 just should never have been able to get to this day. And here we are, 81 years later.\u201d",
      "The Army Air Forces plane nicknamed Heaven Can Wait was a B-24 with a cartoon pin-up angel painted on its nose and a crew of 11 on its final flight.",
      "They were on a mission to bomb Japanese targets when the plane was shot down. Other flyers on the mission were not able to spot survivors.",
      "Their wives, parents and siblings were of a generation that tended to be tight-lipped in their grief. But the men were sorely missed.",
      "Sheppick, 26, and Tennyson, 24, each left behind pregnant wives who would sometimes write them two or three letters a day. Darrigan, 26, also was married, and had been able to attend his son's baptism while on leave. A photo shows him in uniform, smiling as he holds the boy.",
      "Darrigan\u2019s wife, Florence, remarried but quietly held on to photos of her late husband, as well as a telegram informing her of his death.",
      "Tennyson\u2019s wife, Jean, lived until age 96 and never remarried.",
      "\u201cShe never stopped believing that he was going to come home,\u201d said her grandson, Scott Jefferson.",
      "As Memorial Day approached 12 years ago, Althaus asked his mother for names of relatives who died in World War II.",
      "Althaus, a political science and communications professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, became curious while researching World War II casualties for work. His mother gave him the name of her cousin Thomas Kelly, who was 21 years old when he was reported missing in action.",
      "Althaus recalled that as a boy, he visited Kelly's memorial stone, which has a bomber engraved on it. He began reading up on the lost plane.",
      "\u201cIt was a mystery that I discovered really mattered to my extended family,\u201d he said.",
      "With help from other relatives, he analyzed historical documents, photos and eyewitness recollections. They weighed sometimes conflicting accounts of where the plane went down. After a four-year investigation, Althaus wrote a report concluding that the bomber likely crashed off of Awar Point in what is now Papua New Guinea",
      "The report was shared with Project Recover, a nonprofit committed to finding and repatriating missing American service members and a partner of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA. A team from Project Recover, led by researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, located the debris field in 2017 after searching nearly 10 square miles (27 square kilometers) of seafloor.",
      "The DPAA launched its deepest ever underwater recovery mission in 2023.",
      "A Navy dive team recovered dog tags, including Darrigan\u2019s partially corroded tag with his the name of his wife, Florence, as an emergency contact. Kelly\u2019s ring was recovered. The stone was gone, but the word BOMBARDIER was still legible.",
      "And they recovered remains that underwent DNA testing. Last September, the military officially accounted for Darrigan, Kelly, Sheppick and Tennyson.",
      "With seven men who were on the plane still unaccounted for, a future DPAA mission to the site is possible.",
      "More than 200 people honored Darrigan on Saturday in Wappingers Falls, some waving flags from the sidewalk during the procession to the church, others saluting him at a graveside ceremony under cloudy skies.",
      "\u201cAfter 80 years, this great soldier has come home to rest,\u201d Darrigan\u2019s great niece, Susan Pineiro, told mourners at his graveside.",
      "Darrigan\u2019s son died in 2020, but his grandson Eric Schindler attended.",
      "Darrigan\u2019s 85-year-old niece, Virginia Pineiro, solemnly accepted the folded flag.",
      "Kelly's remains arrived in the Bay Area on Friday. He was to be buried Monday at his family\u2019s cemetery plot, right by the marker with the bomber etched on it. A procession of Veterans of Foreign Wars motorcyclists will pass by Kelly\u2019s old home and high school before he is interred.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very unlikely that Tom Kelly\u2019s memory is going to fade soon,\u201d said Althaus, now a volunteer with Project Recover.",
      "Sheppick will be buried in the months ahead near his parents in a cemetery in Coal Center, Pennsylvania. His niece, Deborah Wineland, said she thinks her late father, Sheppick's younger brother, would have wanted it that way. The son Sheppick never met died of cancer while in high school.",
      "Tennyson will be interred on June 27 in Wichita, Kansas. He'll be buried beside his wife, Jean, who died in 2017, just months before the wreckage was located.",
      "\u201cI think because she never stopped believing that he was coming back to her, that it\u2019s only fitting she be proven right,\u201d Jefferson said.",

The bee is now held just outside the nation's capital, at a convention center on the banks of the Potomac River in Oxon Hill, Maryland. It starts Tuesday and concludes Thursday night.",

    "story": [
      "She was a prominent feminist and author of the 1960s and \u201970s.",
      "NEW YORK -- Susan Brownmiller, a prominent feminist and author of the 1960s and '70s whose \"Against Our Will\" was a landmark and intensely debated best-seller about sexual assault, has died. She was 90.",
      "Brownmiller, who had been ill, died Saturday at a New York hospital, according to Emily Jane Goodman, a retired New York State Supreme Court justice and practicing attorney who serves as the executor of Brownmiller's will.",
      "A journalist, anti-war protester and civil rights activist before joining the \u201csecond wave\u201d feminist movement in its formative years, Brownmiller was among many women who were radicalized in the \u201960s and \u201970s and part of the smaller circle that included Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan and Kate Millett who radicalized others.",
      "While activists of the early 20th century focused on voting rights, second wave feminism transformed conversations about sex, marriage reproductive rights, workplace harassment and domestic violence. Brownmiller, as much as anyone, opened up the discussion of rape. \"Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,\" published in 1975 and widely read and taught for decades after, documented the roots, prevalence and politics of rape \u2014 in war and in prison, against children and spouses. She denounced the glorification of rape in popular culture, contended that rape was an act of violence, not lust, and traced rape to the very foundations of human history.",
      "\"Man's structural capacity to rape and woman's corresponding structural vulnerability are as basic to the physiology of both our sexes as the primal act of sex itself,\" she wrote.",
      "In her 1999 memoir \"In Our Time,\" Brownmiller likened the writing of \"Against Our Will\" to \"shooting an arrow into a bulls-eye in very slow motion.\" Brownmiller started the book in the early 1970s after hearing stories from friends that made her shriek \u201cwith dismay.\u201d It was chosen as a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and considered newsworthy enough for Brownmiller to be interviewed on the \"Today\" show by Barbara Walters. In 1976, Time magazine placed her picture on its cover, along with Billie Jean King, Betty Ford and nine others as \"Women of the Year.\"",
      "Brownmiller's book inspired survivors to tell their stories, women to organize rape crisis centers and helped lead to the passage of marital rape laws. It was also received with fear, confusion and anger. Brownmiller remembered a newspaper reporter shouting at her, \"You have no right to disturb my mind like this!\"",
      "Brownmiller was also faulted for writing that rape was an assertion of power that helped all men and was strongly criticized for a chapter titled \"A Question of Race,\" in which she revisited the 1955 murder in Mississippi of Black teen Emmett Till. Brownmiller condemned his gruesome death at the hands of a white mob but also blamed Till for the alleged incident that led to his death: whistling at Bryant's wife, Carolyn Bryant.",
      "The chapter reflected ongoing tensions between feminists and civil rights leaders, with activist Angela Davis writing that Brownmiller's views were \"pervaded with racist ideas.\" In 2017, New Yorker editor David Remnick would call her writing about Till's murder \u201cmorally oblivious.\u201d Asked by Time magazine in 2015 about the passages on Till, she replied that she stood by \u201cevery word.\u201d",
      "Steinem would criticize Brownmiller for comments she made during a 2015 interview with New York magazine, when Brownmiller said that one way for women to avoid being assaulted was not to get drunk, suggesting that women themselves were to blame.",
      "Brownmiller's other books included \"Femininity,\" \"Seeing Vietnam\" and the novel \"Waverly Place,\" based on the highly publicized trial of lawyer Joel Steinberg, convicted in 1987 of manslaughter for the death of his 6-year-old daughter, Lisa. In recent years, Brownmiller taught at Pace University.",
      "\u201cShe was an active feminist, she was not one to just agree with the popular issue of the day,\" said Goodman, whose friendship with Brownmiller spanned decades.",
      "She recalled remarkable gatherings, including poker nights, at Brownmiller's longtime Greenwich Village apartment, which was the subject of her 2017 book, \u201cMy City Highrise Garden.\u201d",
      "Another longtime close friend, 92-year-old Alix Kates Shulman, a fellow writer and feminist, lived within walking distance.",
      "\u201cWe were womens\u2019 liberation comrades,\u201d she said.",
      "Brownmiller was born in New York City in 1935, and would note proudly that her birthday, Feb. 15, was the same as Susan B. Anthony's. Her father was a sales clerk, her mother a secretary and both were so devoted to Franklin Roosevelt and so knowledgeable of current events that Brownmiller \"became very intense about these things too.\" She was a Cornell University scholarship student at and had a brief \"very mistaken ambition\" to be a Broadway star, working as a file clerk and waitress as she hoped for roles that never materialized.",
      "The civil rights movement changed her life.",
      "She joined the Congress of Racial Equality in 1960 and four years later was among the \"Freedom Summer\" volunteers who went to Mississippi to help register Blacks to vote. During the \u201860s, she also wrote for the Village Voice and for ABC television and was a researcher at Newsweek.",
      "In the late 1970s, Brownmiller helped found the New York chapter of \"Women Against Pornography,\" with other members, including Steinem and Adrienne Rich. Organizers agreed that porn degraded and abused women, but differed over how to respond. Brownmiller wrote an influential essay, \"Let's Put Pornography Back in the Closet,\" disputing arguments that pornography was protected by the First Amendment. But she opposed anti-porn leader Catherine MacKinnon's push for legislation, believing that pornography was best confronted through education and protests.",
      "In the 1980s, Brownmiller stepped back from activism and in her memoir noted her despair over the \"slow seepage, symbolic defeats and petty divisions\" that were both causes and symptoms of the movement's decline. But she still remembered her earlier years as a rare and precious chapter.",
      "\"When such a coming-together takes place, when the vision is clear and the sisterhood is powerful, mountains are moved and the human landscape is changed forever,\" Brownmiller wrote. \"Of course it is wildly unrealistic to speak in one voice for half the human race, yet that is what feminism always attempts to do, and must do, and that is what Women's Liberation did do, with astounding success, in our time.\"",

      "Susan Appleton, professor of women, gender. and sexuality studies at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the nation\u2019s culture and society, \u201cincluding law,\u201d have always regulated gender, race and other identities. But, she said, \"I think we\u2019re in a very unusual time when the targets have become very explicit and when for many years we haven\u2019t seen the lack of empathy that we see now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut I do think it\u2019s encouraging to me to see that there is a vigorous resistance,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t know whether it will accomplish anything, but I think it is important to make sure that all voices are heard.\u201d",
      "That people are facing multiple grievances, she said, now shows \u201cit\u2019s not sufficient to look at race alone or gender alone or sexuality alone but all those factors.\u201d They intersect and \"create unique vectors of oppression.\u201d",
      "People at the intersections between the Latino community and immigrant communities \u201cface attacks from all sides,\u201d said Dee Tum-Monge, a board member for the Latinx History Project, the steering organization for Latinx Pride. World Pride is aiming \u201cto create spaces focused around community care and political organizing while still celebrating our joy,\u201d they say.",
      "The focus, Tum-Monge said, is shifting away from just voting and federal action to work that attendees can do at local levels. Amid mounting threats to immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community, Tum-Monge said organizers are particularly concerned about security and will be watching for international participants who may face obstacles traveling.",
      "Although official events are kicking off now, programs that have begun suggest how diverse activities will be. The scene last week was almost solemn as people walked along the National Mall in sight of the Capitol, reading messages on some of the hundreds of quilts made by transgender people from around the country.",
      "The \u201cFreedom to Be\u201d quilt project was there to raise awareness of the transgender community, which has been under fire from President Donald Trump. The messages ranged from defiance to hopes for acceptance. \u201cI hope there are days when you fall in love with being alive,\" said one. And on another: \u201cTHERE\u2019S A LAND THAT I SEE WHERE THE CHILDREN SHOULD BE FREE.\"",
      "Abdool Corlette, head of brand for the American Civil Liberties Union and a co-creator of the project, said a message needed to be sent.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing across the board an attempt to erase trans folks from all public life,\" Corlette said. \"And we knew that we need to take up space. We needed to memorialize people\u2019s stories and do it in the literal backyard of the Capitol.\u201d",
      "Gillian Branstetter, his co-creator and communications strategist at the ACLU's Women's Project, said actions like the Republican president's executive order that affects military personnel are abstract to some but have real impacts in the transgender community where health care is threatened, along with the loss of jobs and threats of violence.",
      "The scene was anything but solemn 3 miles north of the Mall, inside the student center at Howard University, one of the nation's renowned historically Black universities. It was festive and bright, filled with joy and shouts of encouragement and music as members of various groups \u2014 called houses \u2014 competed in events that included fashion modeling and dance at the Cirque du Slay Ball.",
      "One attendee, John Smith III (stage name IconFatty Prodigy), said the balls are modeled on Cirque du Soleil and are about community and safe spaces. Iran Paylor (stage name Bang Garcon) said the houses are places set up by LGBTQ communities to give safe spaces to others estranged from their families and ostracized within the Black community when they came out.",
      "D.C. Black Pride began in 1975 at the ClubHouse, founded by members of the city's LGBTQ community. Over the years, an event around Memorial Day became a tradition. The ClubHouse closed in 1990, but three members of the community kept the tradition going. The first Black Gay and Lesbian Pride event was held on May 25, 1991.",
      "Hutton is the president and CEO of the Center for Black Equity, founded in 1999 as a way to bring together all of the Black pride movements that were being created around the country following the model in Washington. There are 54 in the United States and 12 internationally, he said.",
      "As a Black gay man, Hutton already had battles on multiple fronts. Now there is an additional category to worry about.",
      "\"I'm also a child of immigrants, just to add that on top of my intersections,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always paying attention to immigration conversations. It\u2019s very hard navigating the world right now.\u201d",
      "But, he said, his responsibility is to use the access he has developed over the years to create safe spaces. \"So even though it is difficult to navigate and listen to the news every day, I also understand that I\u2019ve been given this task.\u201d",
      "The job has been hard this year. Sponsors have pulled out of the celebrations and he knows some international travelers are not coming due to fear they will have difficulties with law enforcement.",
      "Hutton understands why various groups want individual activities; one version will not accommodate all audiences. But the cornerstone of Black pride is community. \u201cWe have the opportunity to really showcase all of these communities to the world,\u201d he said.",
      "In the end, he said, he wants one message to resound after the gathering of communities: \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll continue pushing our rights forward, not just for us in America,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cAs someone told me, when America sneezes, the world catches a cold. So we have to make sure that America doesn\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d",

      "One initiative distributes laptops in rural Iowa",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- One program distributes laptops in rural Iowa. Another helped people get back online after Hurricane Helene washed away computers and phones in western North Carolina. Programs in Oregon and rural Alabama teach older people, including some who have never touched a computer, how to navigate in an increasingly digital world.",
      "It all came crashing down this month when President Donald Trump \u2014 on his own digital platform, Truth Social \u2014 announced his intention to end the Digital Equity Act, a federal grant program meant to help bridge the digital divide. He branded it as \u201cRACIST and ILLEGAL\u201d and said it amounts to \u201cwoke handouts based on race.\u201d He said it was an \u201cILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway,\" though the program was actually funded with $2.75 billion.",
      "The name seemed innocuous enough when the program was approved by Congress in 2021 as part of a $65 billion investment meant to bring internet access to every home and business in the United States. The broadband program itself was a key component of the $1 trillion infrastructure law pushed through by the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "The Digital Equity Act was intended to fill gaps and cover unmet needs that surfaced during the massive broadband rollout. It gave states and tribes flexibility to deliver high-speed internet access to families that could not afford it, computers to kids who did not have them, telehealth access to older adults in rural areas, and training and job skills to veterans.",
      "Whether Trump has the legal authority to end the program remains unknown. But for now the Republican administration can simply stop spending the money.",
      "\u201cI just felt my heart break for what we were finally, finally in this country, going to address, the digital divide,\" said Angela Siefer, executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a nonprofit that was awarded \u2014 but has not received \u2014 a $25.7 million grant to work with groups across the country to help provide access to technology. \u201cThe digital divide is not just physical access to the internet, it is being able to use that to do what you need to do.\u201d",
      "While the name of the program likely got it targeted \u2014 the Trump administration has been aggressively scrubbing the government of programs that promote diversity, equity or inclusion \u2014 the Digital Equity Act was supposed to be broader in scope.",
      "Though Trump called it racist, the words \u201crace\u201d or \u201cracial\u201d appear just twice in the law\u2019s text: once, alongside \u201ccolor, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability,\u201d in a passage stating that no groups should be excluded from funding, and later, in a list of covered populations, along with older adults, veterans, people with disabilities, English learners, people with low literacy levels and rural Americans.",
      "\u201cDigital Equity passed with overwhelming bipartisan support,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the act's chief proponent, in a statement. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because my Republican colleagues have heard the same stories as I have \u2014 like kids in rural communities forced to drive to McDonalds parking lots for Wi-Fi to do their homework.",
      "\"It is insane \u2014 absolutely nuts \u2014 that Trump is blocking resources to help make sure kids in rural school districts can get hot spots or laptops, all because he doesn\u2019t like the word equity!\u201d",
      "The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which administers the program, declined to comment. It\u2019s not entirely clear how much of the $2.75 billion has been awarded, though last March the NTIA announced the allocation of $811 million to states, territories and tribes.",
      "On a recent morning in Portland, Oregon, Brandon Dorn was among those taking a keyboard basics class offered by Free Geek, a nonprofit that provides free courses to help people learn to use computers. The class was offered at a low-income housing building to make it accessible for residents.",
      "Dorn and the others were given laptops and shown the different functions of keys: control, shift and caps lock, how to copy and paste. They played a typing game that taught finger and key placement on a color-coded keyboard.",
      "Dorn, 63, said the classes helped because \u201cin this day and age, everything has to go through the computer.\u201d He said it helped him feel more confident and less dependent on his children or grandchildren to do things such as making appointments online.",
      "\u201cFolks my age, we didn\u2019t get this luxury because we were too busy working, raising the family,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is a great way to help us help ourselves.\u201d",
      "Juan Muro, Free Geek\u2019s executive director, said participants get the tools and skills they need to access things like online banking, job applications, online education programs and telehealth. He said Trump's move to end funding has put nonprofits such as Free Geek in a precarious position, forcing them to make up the difference through their own fundraising and \u201cbeg for money to just provide individuals with essential stuff.\"",
      "Sara Nichols works for the Land of Sky Regional Council, a multicounty planning and development organization in western North Carolina. On the Friday before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, the organization received notice that it was approved for a grant. But like other groups The Associated Press contacted, it has not seen any money.",
      "Land of Sky had spent a lot of resources helping people recover from last year's storms. The award notice, Nichols said, came as \u201cincredible news.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut between this and the state losing, getting their letters terminated, we feel just like stuck. What are we going to do? How are we going to move forward? How are we going to let our communities continue to fall behind?\u201d",
      "More than one-fifth of Americans do not have broadband internet access at home, according to the Pew Research Center. In rural communities, the number jumps to 27 percent.",
      "Beyond giving people access to technology and fast internet, many programs funded by the Digital Equity Act sought to provide \u201cdigital navigators\u201d \u2014 human helpers to guide people new to the online world.",
      "\u201cIn the United States we do not have a consistent source of funding to help individuals get online, understand how to be safe online and how to use that technology to accomplish all the things that are required now as part of life that are online,\u201d said Siefer of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.",
      "This includes everything from providing families with internet hot spots so they can get online at home to helping seniors avoid online scams.",
      "\u201cHealth, workforce, education, jobs, everything, right?\u201d Siefer said. \u201cThis law was going to be the start for the U.S. to figure out this issue. It\u2019s a new issue in the big scheme of things, because now technology is no longer a nice-to-have. You have to have the internet and you have to know how to use the technology just to survive, let alone to thrive today.\u201d",
      "Siefer said the word \u201cequity\u201d in the name probably prompted Trump to target the program for elimination.",
      "\u201cBut it means that he didn\u2019t actually look at what this program does,\" she said. \"Because who doesn\u2019t want grandma to be safe online? Who doesn\u2019t want a veteran to be able to talk to their doctor rather than get in a car and drive two hours? Who doesn\u2019t want students to be able to do their homework?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military spent more than $6 billion over the past three years to recruit and retain service members, in what's been a growing campaign to counter enlistment shortfalls",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. military spent more than $6 billion over the past three years to recruit and retain service members, in what has been a growing campaign to counter enlistment shortfalls.",
      "The financial incentives to reenlist in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines increased dramatically from 2022 through last year, with the Navy vastly outspending the others, according to funding totals provided by the services. The overall amount of recruiting bonuses also rose steadily, fueled by significant jumps in spending by the Army and Marine Corps.",
      "The military services have routinely poured money into recruiting and retention bonuses over the years. But the totals spiked as Pentagon leaders tried to reverse falling enlistment numbers, particularly as COVID-19 restrictions locked down public events, fairs and school visits that recruiters relied on to meet with young people.",
      "Coupled with an array of new programs, an increased number of recruiters and adjustments to enlistment requirements, the additional incentives have helped the services bounce back from the shortfalls. All but the Navy met their recruiting targets last year and all are expected to do so this year.",
      "President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeatedly point to Trump\u2019s election as a reason for the recruiting rebound. But the enlistment increases began long before last November, and officials have tied them more directly to the widespread overhauls that the services have done, including the increased financial incentives.",
      "The Army, the military's largest service, spent more on recruiting bonuses in 2022 and 2024 than the other services. But it was significantly outspent by the Navy in 2023, when the sea service was struggling to overcome a large enlistment shortfall.",
      "As a result, even though the Navy is a smaller service, it spent more overall in the three years than the Army did.",
      "The Navy also has spent considerably more than the others to entice sailors to reenlist, doling out retention bonuses to roughly 70,000 service members for each of the past three years. That total is more than double the number of troops the Army gave retention bonuses to each year, even though the Army is a much larger service.",
      "\u201cNavy is dedicated to retaining our most capable sailors; retention is a critical component of achieving our end-strength goals,\u201d Adm. James Kilby, the vice chief of naval operations, told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee in March.",
      "He said reenlistment for enlisted sailors \u201cremains healthy\u201d but officers are a challenge in specific jobs, including aviation, explosive ordnance disposal, surface and submarine warfare, health professionals and naval special operations. He added that the Navy has struggled to fill all of its at-sea jobs and is using financial incentives as one way to combat the problem.",
      "The Army has seen the greatest recruiting struggles over the past decade, and by using a range of new programs and policies has had one of the largest comebacks. The Navy has had the most trouble more recently, and took a number of steps to expand those eligible for service and spend more in bonuses.",
      "While the Army spends hundreds of millions each year to recruit troops, it also has relied on an array of new programs and policies to woo young people. A key driver of the Army's rebound has been its decision to create the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022.",
      "That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training. It has resulted in thousands of enlistments.",
      "The Air Force increased its spending on recruiting bonuses in 2023 as it also struggled to overcome shortfalls, but lowered the amount the following year. The payments were for jobs including munitions systems, aircraft maintenance and security forces. The Space Force does not currently authorize enlistment bonuses.",
      "The Marine Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their recruiting goals, although the Marines had to dig deep into their pool of delayed entry candidates in 2022 to meet their target. The Corps, which is much smaller than the Army and Air Force, spends the least on bonuses and tends to spread the amount among a larger number of service members.",
      "Maj. Jacoby Getty, a Marine spokesman, said the spike in retention bonuses from $126 million in 2023 to $201 million in 2024 was because Marines were allowed to reenlist a year early for the first time. More than 7,000 Marines got bonuses as a result, a jump of nearly 2,200 over the previous year.",
      "When asked about bonuses in 2023, Gen. Eric Smith, the Marine commandant, famously told a naval conference that \u201cyour bonus is you get to call yourself a Marine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s your bonus, right?\" he said. \"There\u2019s no dollar amount that goes with that.\u201d",
      "The services tailor their recruiting and retention money to bolster harder-to-fill jobs, including cyber, intelligence and special operations forces. The Army and Marine Corps also use the money to woo troops to some combat, armor and artillery jobs.",

      "Can the pope remain a U.S. citizen while leading a foreign government? Here are things to know about Leo's citizenship.",
      "In addition to being the spiritual leader for what the church says is roughly 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide, Leo is also the head of what's recognized as the world's smallest nation.",
      "Vatican City covers just 0.17 square miles (0.44 square kilometers) and has a population of a few hundred people. It became an independent state in 1929 under a treaty between Italy and the Holy See.",

      "\u201cSuch cases raise complex questions of international law, including issues related to the level of immunity from U.S. jurisdiction that the person so serving may be afforded,\u201d the policy states.",
      "The State Department declined to comment on the pope\u2019s status. A spokesperson said the department doesn\u2019t discuss the citizenship of individuals.",
      "The core issue is whether foreign leaders should hold American citizenship when they also enjoy broad immunity from U.S. laws, said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor and an expert on citizenship law. Such immunity clashes with the constitutional principle that no U.S. citizen should be above the law.",
      "However, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1980 decision ruled that Americans can't be stripped of their citizenship unless they intentionally renounce it.",
      "\u201cThe State Department never assumes that you intend to lose your citizenship unless you specifically say so through the renunciation process,\u201d Spiro said.",
      "He said it would be hard to argue that Leo, by becoming pope, demonstrated an intent to give up being a U.S. citizen.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. moves to terminate the pope\u2019s citizenship,\u201d Spiro said.",
      "Peruvian law has no conflict with Pope Leo remaining a citizen, said Jorge Puch, deputy director of registry archives at Peru\u2019s National Registry of Identification and Civil Status.",
      "Leo was granted Peruvian citizenship in August 2015, the month before Pope Francis appointed him bishop of Chiclayo in the South American country's northern region. To qualify, he had to live in Peru for at least two years and pass a civics test.",
      "\u201cIt is the most praiseworthy thing our beloved supreme pontiff could have done: Wanting to have Peruvian nationality without having been Peruvian by birth,\u201d Puch said.",
      "All adult Peruvians, including naturalized citizens, are required to vote in elections through age 69. Voting in Peru's presidential election next April won't be mandatory for Leo. He turns 70 in September.",
      "It's not clear what happened to the citizenship status of Leo's predecessors once they became pope. That's not information the Vatican discloses.",
      "Pope Francis renewed his passport in his home country of Argentina in 2014, the year after he became pope. German-born Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II, a native of Poland, never publicly relinquished citizenship in their home countries.",

      "\u201cNed\u2019s ready to go,\u201d Keyser said. \u201cHe\u2019s picked up on all that. He\u2019s doing fantastic, running birds off.\u201d",
      "Inside the airport operations center, Hercules is laid back until he's told it\u2019s time to work, barking at the door in anticipation. Ned, on the other hand, is always moving. When not outside, he\u2019ll bring his blue bouncy ball to anyone willing to play fetch.",
      "Charleston\u2019s airport is on top of a mountain and has a menagerie of wildlife, including Canada geese, hawks, ducks, songbirds and bats. After it rains, worms come to the surface and cause an increase in bird activity, Keyser said.",
      "In addition to taking the dogs on their regular rounds, Keyser is in constant contact with the airport tower, which looks for birds on the field or relays reports from airplanes that see wildlife nearby.",
      "\u201cWe get plenty of exercise,\u201d Keyser said. \u201cYou don\u2019t gain no weight in this job. It\u2019s an all-day job. You\u2019re always got your eyes on the field, you\u2019ve got your ears open listening to the radio.\"",
      "Border collies are among the most energetic dog breeds. They've been used for decades to shoo Canada geese off golf courses. They've also scared away birds at other airports, military bases, and locks and dams.",
      "The dogs' instincts are to herd, not to kill. \u201cBut in the mind of the bird, they\u2019re no different than a coyote or a fox, which is a natural predator for the bird,\u201d Gibson said.",
      "About 19,000 strikes involving planes and wildlife occurred at U.S. airports in 2023, of which 95% involved birds, according to a Federal Aviation Administration database. From 1988 to 2023, wildlife collisions in the U.S. killed 76 people and destroyed 126 aircraft.",
      "Perhaps the most famous bird-plane strike occurred in January 2009 when a flight from New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport almost immediately flew into a flock of Canada geese, knocking out both engines. Pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger guided the powerless jet into the frigid Hudson River. All 155 people on board survived the incident, which was captured in the 2016 movie \u201cSully,\u201d starring Tom Hanks.",
      "At the Charleston airport, wildlife-plane incidents vary each year from a few to a couple dozen.",
      "\u201cAnytime a plane hits a bird, it has to be inspected, and it causes a delay in the flight,\u201d Keyser said. \u201cAnd sometimes you don\u2019t make your connecting flights. So that\u2019s how important it is to keep everything going smooth.\u201d",
      "In 2022 alone, there were five airplane strikes at the airport involving bats. In December 2000, a plane collided with two deer after landing. The tip of the right engine propeller blade separated and punctured the plane\u2019s fuselage, seriously injuring a passenger, according to the FAA.",
      "Inside the terminal, Hercules wags his tail as he moves about greeting passengers. Among them was Janet Spry, a Scott Depot, West Virginia, resident waiting to board a flight to visit her daughter and grandchildren in San Antonio.",
      "Spry needed a bit of cheering up. In addition to having a fear of flying, Spry's 15-year-old cat was euthanized the previous day after being diagnosed with an inoperable condition.",
      "An impromptu visit from Hercules brought a smile \u2014 and more. Hercules placed a paw on Spry\u2019s arm and delivered plenty of wet kisses.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s making my day better,\u201d Spry said.",
      "She also joked whether the airport might want to let Hercules stay with her a while longer.",
      "\u201cI think there was an empty seat on the plane beside me,\u201d Spry said.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Religious services, concerts and vigils are set to mark Sunday\u2019s fifth anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder by a Minneapolis police officer even as police reform and civil rights activists face what they see as a backlash from the Trump administration.",
      "Events in Minneapolis center around George Floyd Square, the intersection where police Officer Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes, even as the 46-year-old Black man's cried \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d",
      "The events started Friday with concerts, a street festival and a \u201cself-care fair,\u201d and culminate with a worship service, gospel music concert and candlelight vigil on Sunday.",
      "In Houston, where Floyd grew up, family members planned to gather Sunday at his gravesite for a memorial service led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. In a park about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away, a memorial service will take place, followed by five hours of music, preaching and poetry readings and a balloon release.",
      "The remembrances come at a fraught moment for activists, who had hoped the worldwide protests that followed Floyd's murder on May 25, 2020, would lead to permanent police reform across the U.S. and a continued focus on racial justice issues.",
      "Even with Minneapolis officials' promises to remake the police department, some activists contend the progress has come at a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cWe understand that change takes time,\u201d Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said in a statement last week. \u201cHowever, the progress being claimed by the city is not being felt in the streets.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration moved Wednesday to cancel settlements with Minneapolis and Louisville that called for an overhaul of their police departments following the Floyd's murder and the killing of Breonna Taylor. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, the U.S. Justice Department had aggressively pushed for aggressive oversight of local police it had accused of widespread abuses.",
      "Trump also declared an end to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within the federal government and his administration is using federal funds as leverage to force local governments, universities and public school districts to do the same. Republican-led states also have accelerated their efforts to stamp out DEI initiatives.",

      "A massive loggerhead sea turtle that was hit by a boat off Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast arrived at a turtle hospital in need of medical care",
      "JUNO BEACH, Fla. -- A massive loggerhead sea turtle hit by a boat off Florida's Atlantic coast arrived at a turtle hospital needing medical care, but at 302 pounds (137 kilograms), Pennywise was too large to fit their equipment.",
      "So the veterinary team at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach took her to nearby Jupiter Medical Center, hoping she could get a CT scan on a human machine. She was too big for that, as well.",
      "They quickly came up with another plan: taking Pennywise to Palm Beach Equine Clinic in Wellington, where the scan was performed on equipment designed for horses.",
      "\u201cAnd, luckily, the horse-sized machine was big enough to fit this lady through,\" Heather Barron, the chief science officer and veterinarian at Loggerhead, told The Associated Press.",
      "Turns out, they also got a nice surprise: Images showed that Pennywise is carrying eggs.",
      "\u201cWe hope we\u2019ll be able to get her back out there into the wild as soon as possible so that she can lay those eggs,\" Barron said.",
      "Loggerheads, an endangered species, often lay multiple clutches during a season, she said.",
      "Pennywise arrived at the center Monday, after a crew from Inwater Research Group found her floating in the Atlantic with significant blunt force trauma to her shell that had already started to heal.",
      "The staff at the Juno Beach turtle center estimated that Pennywise's injuries were about a month old. Barron said the imaging showed some damage to bones that surround the spinal cord. They have the turtle on high-powered antibiotics.",
      "\"Luckily, right now, her neurologic exam shows that all those nerves are intact. And that is a great sign for her. We\u2019re very excited about that and we\u2019ll just be rechecking to make sure that we have no progression of the disease, and as soon as we feel like that wound is healed well enough, she can go back out into the wild.\u201d",
      "Even so, Barron said, Pennywise's story is a \u201ctextbook case of a turtle returning to the area for mating and nesting season, only to fall victim to an entirely preventable boat-strike injury.\u201d",
      "Because nesting season in Florida runs from March 1 to Oct. 31, officials at the sea turtle center are encouraging boaters to slow down and to be especially mindful in what they refer to as the Sea Turtle Protection Zone, which extends a mile (1.6 kilometers) off the coast.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:10:59 -0400",
    "summary": "John Mauceri had a complicated health history, but his sudden swelling and fatigue left his team of doctors stumped.",
    "story": [
      "Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence.",
      "In December 2023, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a \"troublesome\" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his left lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later.",
      "Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct.",
      "\"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes,\" Mauceri said. \"Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house.\"",
      "No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms.",
      "\"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain,\" Mauceri said.",
      "Searching for a diagnosis",
      "Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure.",
      "While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But \"the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest,\" the doctor said.",
      "What is pericardial constriction?",
      "Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen.",
      "It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19.",
      "Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.",
      "Mauceri accepted that the surgery was his only option.",
      "\"There was no alternative,\" he said. \"I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'\"",
      "A high-risk surgery",
      "Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's \"heart was trapped\" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said.",
      "\"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped,\" Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said.",
      "Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one.",
      "\"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell,\" Grossi said.",
      "Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.",
      "\"Every day is a miracle\"",
      "After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college.",
      "\"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it,\" Mauceri said.",
      "His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again.",
      "Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success.",
      "Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in October, shortly after his 80th birthday.",
      "\"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore,\" he said. \"I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did.\"",

The condition occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain functions,\u00a0according to Johns Hopkins. Typically, the fluid cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord, but too much can lead to NPH. The condition is relatively uncommon but is more likely to occur in older people, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. There's no known cause of the condition.",
      "\"Usually, it just comes out of the blue. We really don't know why,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said.",
      "NPH is usually treated by implanting a shunt in the brain to drain the fluid, LaPook explained.",
      "Joel said in his statement that he will undergo physical therapy, and has been advised to refrain from performing during that time. He has canceled concerts, including an eight-performance tour, through July 2026. He said in the statement that he is looking forward to making a return to the stage once he has recovered.",

      "Phil Robertson would go on to create and patent the Duck Commander duck call, which also became the name of the company he incorporated in the early 1970s. In addition to duck calls, the company expanded into selling a variety of other products under other brand names, such as fishing equipment, deer calls and even truck accessories. Phil Robertson's son, Willie Robertson, currently serves as the company's CEO.",
      "The A&E reality series \"Duck Dynasty, which ran from 2012-2017, followed the lives of the members of the Robertson family, shooting them to fame.",
      "Phil Robertson was briefly suspended by the network in 2013 when, in an interview with GQ magazine, he said homosexuality was \"sinful\" and mentioned it in connection with bestiality. A&E ultimately relented and ended his suspension without any episodes of the show being affected.",
      "Phil Robertson and his family were outspoken conservatives. Phil Robertson initially backed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican primary, but eventually said he would support President Trump once he secured the party's nomination. Phil Robertson also backed Mr. Trump over former President Biden in 2020.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anne-tyler-on-a-writers-selfish-motive-to-explore-other-lives/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 10:42:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Pulitzer Prize-winner's tales of lives shattered and mended by love have broken countless hearts. In her latest, \"Three Days in June,\" Anne Tyler details a weekend in the life of a divorced school administrator, bookended by the loss of her job and her daughter's wedding.",
    "story": [
      "Novelist Anne Tyler was once described as a writer who likes to break America's heart. \"Oh, dear! Well, don't you think life kind of breaks your heart?\" she said.",
      "Stories about life breaking your heart, and how love can sometimes mend it, have made Tyler a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, and a best-selling author for six decades.",
      "In 1977, she told The New York Times, \"It does matter to me that I be considered a serious writer. \u2026. A serious book is one that removes me to another life as I am reading it. \u2026 It has to be an extremely believable lie.\"",
      "\"I don't remember saying that, but I believe every word of it still!\" she laughed. \"The fact that it's a lie is a very important part of what makes it not real life, don't worry! And the fact that it's a believable lie makes you say, I am actually being another person right now.\"",
      "The people who live in Tyler's two dozen books have touched countless readers: \"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,\" \"Breathing Lessons,\" \"A Spool of Blue Thread,\" and \"The Accidental Tourist,\" which became a critically-acclaimed film with William Hurt as a travel writer who hates to travel, and Geena Davis, who won an Oscar for playing the woman who shows him that love is possible for those willing to take a chance.",
      "Tyler said, \"What makes me keep going as a writer is a more selfish motive, which is, I'm just always wanting to know what it's like to be somebody else. \u2026 I feel almost deprived that I have just this one life; I have to be greedy and reach out and see, Well, that guy I just passed in the street, he said that strang thing, what is it like to be him? It's just self-indulgence to sit and write all day and pretend I'm somebody else.\"",
      "\"I love listening to people\"",
      "Tyler grew up in a quiet Quaker community in North Carolina. She would tell herself stories to fall asleep at night: \"I would fold my knees up and that would be my desk, and I would be a doctor seeing patients, and I would whisper these conversations. And it always ended with my brother in the bed across the room shouting out, 'Mama, Anne's whispering again!'\"",
      "Something her readers have long heard about, but never seen: her \"blue box,\" full of hand-written notes to herself. I asked, \"Is it fun for you to page through the blue box and go, 'Oh, I forgot I thought about that'?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said. \"But we should never page through it too often, because then it won't be surprising.\"",
      "The box is filled with ideas and snippets of conversations overheard in grocery stores or coffee shops that she might slip into a book. \"I love listening to people; I like to hear them nattering on,\" she said. \"That's why the pandemic hit my writing career very hard! Because I love to just be walking down the street and you hear somebody say two words, as I go on, I think, I wonder what that was about? And that's where stories begin.\"",
      "No place is more associated with Tyler than Baltimore, Maryland. It's where she and her late husband, Iranian novelist and psychiatrist Taghi Modarressi, raised their two daughters.",
      "So, why does she keep returning to Baltimore as a setting for her stories? \"Laziness,\" she mused.",
      "\"You seem to have a love for the setting,\" I said.",
      "\"But face the fact that if I wrote about somebody in New York, I'd have to find out a bunch of things about New York,\" Tyler said. \"And here I am! But I don't know why it is that I feel there's sort of more there there in the average Baltimorean than there are in people in other places.\"",
      "\"I'm going to be writing this [next] book forever\"",
      "Tyler's latest book, \"Three Days in June,\" details a long weekend in the life of a school administrator, bookended by the loss of her job and her daughter's wedding. At one point the book's main character, Gail, says, \"I'm not the kind of woman who dreams of doing things.\"",
      "I asked Tyler, \"If you could pretend to be anybody, why choose the assistant headmistress at a school in Baltimore, versus a movie star or a head of state?\"",
      "\"You think that's bad \u2013 the current thing I'm working on, the guy remodels kitchens for a living,\" Tyler replied. \"I don't know! I've often asked myself, if I want to be somebody else, why not somebody heroic and crusading out in the world? But I don't get to choose. I always say novels are like olives in one of those tall, thin bottles. You just get out an olive that's on top. This is the one that comes next.\"",
      "But the lives of her characters, and the jobs they have, are anything but humdrum. \"And there is a beauty in the acceptance that people have over their own lives,\" I said. \"Sometimes people just end up in a place like Baltimore.\"",
      "\"They make a life there!\" she laughed.",
      "Now, at age 83, Anne Tyler says she'll keep doing what she has always done: listen, think, and write about people who might shatter your heart, or stitch it back together.",
      "Asked how many more books we might expect from her, Tyler replied, \"Well, I'm going to be writing this [next] book forever, and when I finish it, if I do finish it before I die, I will rewrite it. And if I'm still not dead, I will rewrite it again, because I'm not going to bring out another book. I'm horrified that I have 25 books in a list in the front of this latest novel.\"",
      "\"Isn't that a joy, Anne? Twenty-five books?\" I asked.",
      "\"No!\" she said. \"My next-door neighbor many years ago said, 'You do churn them out, don't you?'\"",
      "\"That comment clearly lingers in your mind.\"",
      "\"It's engraved there, yes!\" she laughed.",

      "It's hard to resist staring back at paintings by artist Amy Sherald, now on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Sherald is best known for her portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama, but the exhibit gives a more complete look at her palette. \"That painting is here in the show, and we're very happy to be able to share it with visitors here,\" said co-curator Rujeko Hockley. \"But we really wanted to show the progression of her work as an artist.",
      "\"Amy often paints the skin tone of her subjects, who are Black people, in what we call grisaille, or gray tone,\" said Hockley. \"It kind of disrupts this immediate identification, perhaps even stereotyping that all of us are, you know, subject to.\"",
      "It's not the only way to spot a Sherald painting. Hockley said one characteristic of the artist's work is her subjects' body language: \"Very kind of solid, confident, not over-confident, but just really certain and still in [themselves].\"",
      "The Sherald exhibition, said Hockley, is \"a show that is really speaking to kind of overwhelmingly positive sense of connection, and kind of shared humanity, and kind of beauty that comes from being around one another, that comes from kind of seeing the humanity in another.\"",

      "The clock gathered itself together with a whirring of gears and struck a series of blurry notes. Nine o'clock, I was thinking; but no, it turned out to be ten. I'd been sitting there in a sort of stupor, evidently. I stood up and hung my purse in the closet, but then outside the window I saw some movement on the other side of the curtain, some dark and ponderous shape laboring up my front walk. I tweaked the curtain aside a half inch. Max, for God's sake. Max with a duffel bag slung over one shoulder, and a bulky square suitcase dangling from his left hand.",
      "I went to the front door and opened it and looked out at him through the screen. \"What on earth?\" I asked him.",
      "\"You're home!\" he said.",
      "\"Yes ...\"",
      "\"Debbie is at something called a Day of Beauty.\"",
      "\"Right,\" I said.",
      "\"But she knew ahead I was coming. I told her I was coming. I get there and no one's home. I call her cell phone and she says she didn't expect me so early.\"",
      "\"Why did you come so early?\" I asked him.",
      "\"I wanted to beat the rush. You know what Fridays are like on the Bay Bridge.\"",
      "All the more reason not to live on the other side of it, I could have pointed out. I opened the screen door for him and reached for his suitcase, but it wasn't a suitcase; it was some kind of animal carrier. Square patch of wire grid on the end and something watchful and alert staring out from behind it gleaming-eyed. Max moved the carrier away from me a bit and said, \"I've got it.\"",
      "\"What is it?\"",
      "\"It's a cat.\"",
      "\"A cat!\"",
      "\"Could I come in, do you think?\"",
      "I retreated and he lumbered in, out of breath, shaking the floorboards. Max was nowhere near fat, but he was weighty, broad shouldered; he always gave the impression of taking up more than his share of room, although he was not much taller than I was. In the years since we'd divorced he had grown the kind of beard that you're not quite sure is deliberate; maybe he'd merely forgotten to shave for a while. A short gray frizzle with a frizzle of gray hair to match, and he seemed to have given up on his clothes; generally he wore stretched-out knit tops and baggy khakis. I hoped he'd brought a suit for the wedding. You never could be sure.",
      "\"Couldn't you have just left your cat at home with food and water?\" I asked, following him through the living room. \"I mean, it's already bad enough that you're staying with Debbie yourself. In the middle of her wedding preparations, for God's sake!\"",
      "\"She said it would be fine if I stayed,\" Max told me. \"She said it wasn't a problem.\"",
      "\"Okay, but then to add a cat to the mix ... Cats do very well on their own. They almost prefer it, in fact.\"",
      "\"Not this one,\" he said. He set the carrier on my kitchen counter. \"This one is too new.\"",
      "\"It's a kitten?\"",
      "\"No, no, it's old.\"",
      "\"You just said\u2014\"",
      "\"It's an elderly female cat who belonged to a very old woman, and now the woman has up and died and the cat is in mourning,\" he told me.",
      "There was a lot I could have asked about this, but it didn't seem worth the effort. I leaned closer to peer at the cat. \"Does Debbie know you're bringing it?\" I asked him.",
      "\"Now she does.\"",
      "I waited.",
      "\"It's complicated,\" he said. He blotted his face on his shoulder. \"I phoned her; I said, 'Where are you?' She says she's at a Day of Beauty. 'Did you leave a key out someplace?' I asked her, and she says no, but she'll be home in a few hours. 'A few hours!' I say. 'I can't wait a few hours! I've got a cat here!' She says, 'A what?' Then she hits the roof. Tells me I can in no way bring a cat to her house, because Kenneth is allergic.\"",
      "\"He is?\" I said.",
      "\"Deathly allergic, is how she put it.\"",
      "\"But ... Kenneth doesn't live there,\" I said.",
      "\"Don't kid yourself,\" Max told me. \"You know he stays over a lot, and besides, he does plan to live there after the wedding.\"",
      "\"Well, sure, after the wedding.\"",
      "\"'Deathly' allergic, Gail. As in, if he walks into a house where a cat has left a smidgen of dander behind, even if the cat is long gone he'll need a respirator.\"",
      "\"A respirator!\"",
      "\"Or whatever you call those things that asthmatics have to carry around with them.\"",
      "\"You mean an atomizer,\" I said.",
      "\"No, not an atomizer; a what's- it. A vaporizer, maybe?\"",
      "I thought it over.",
      "\"At any rate, that's what Debbie claimed. She claimed that even if he's just standing next to her and she has cat dander on her sweater, he will start choking up and he'll need a ...\"",
      "We both stood there, considering.",
      "The cat said, \"Hmm?\"",
      "We looked over at the carrier.",
      "\"Anyhow,\" Max said, and he unfastened the two latches and lifted the lid. Instead of stepping out, the cat hunched lower and stared up at me. A gray-and-black tabby with a chunky face. \"So I couldn't think where to go except here,\" Max said. \"I knew where you hide your key. It didn't occur to me that you would be home on a weekday.\"",
      "\"Yes, well ...,\" I said. And then I told the cat, \"Hey there.\" She squared her eyes at me.",
      "\"What's her name?\" I asked Max.",
      "\"I don't know.\"",
      "\"What? How could you not know?\"",
      "\"I'm just the fosterer,\" he told me. \"I volunteer at this shelter where they need people to foster animals until they can be adopted. Ordinarily it's kittens, batches of feral kittens that need domesticating first, but this one's a senior citizen. I'm thinking of naming her 'Pearl,' at least for as long as I have her around.\"",
      "\"Pearl!\"",
      "\"On account of her color.\"",
      "\"You can't name a cat 'Pearl.'\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"Cats are so bad at language,\" I told him. \"They're not the least bit like dogs. Cats just get your general tone, and 'Pearl' has a tone like a growl.\"",
      "\"It does?\"",
      "\"So does 'Ruby.' So does 'Rhinestone.'\"",
      "\"Aha!\" Max said. \"See there? Everything turns out for the best.\"",
      "\"It does?\" I said. \"What are you talking about?\"",
      "\"You can advise me on cat lore,\" he said. \"Plus you might even decide to adopt her; who knows?\"",
      "\"Max,\" I said, \"sometimes I wonder if you understand the least little thing about me.\"",
      "\"But you love cats! You used to have that homely little calico cat. And this one's accustomed to older women.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" I said.",
      "\"'Older,' I said. Not 'old.'\"",
      "\"I do not want a cat in any way, shape, or form,\" I told him. \"What do you think of 'Mary?'\" he asked. \"Or 'Carol.' How about that?\"",
      "\"Forget it, Max,\" I said. Then I added, \"And you want to steer away from the r sound. An r is a growl, straight out.\"",
      "\"Oh, right. Yes. Thank you.\" He paused. \"How about 'Lucy'?\" he said.",
      "\"Forget it, I told you.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"Maybe you could drop her off at a shelter here in Baltimore,\" I said. \"I mean, surely they wouldn't refuse her.\"",
      "\"We're not allowed to just dump our charges any-old-where,\" he told me. \"No, I'd better keep her here at your house, and then take her back to Cornboro if you really don't want her.\"",
      "\"I most emphatically do not want her,\" I said. Then, \"Nor do I want a houseguest.\"",
      "\"Yes, but, see, there's dander all over my clothes now. I can't possibly go back to Debbie's, even without the cat.\"",
      "\"In fact, I wonder if you should come to the wedding, even,\" I said. \"Just think if Kenneth starts choking during the vows.\"",
      "This was pure mischief, on my part. I seriously doubted that Kenneth would choke; he'd always struck me as a sturdy type of guy.",
      "But Max looked stricken. He said, \"Not attend my own daughter's wedding?\"",
      "\"Well, you could maybe wear a raincoat,\" I said. \"Or one of those hazmat suits.\"",
      "The kitchen phone rang. We both glanced over at it. It rang again, and then a third time. \"Aren't you going to get that?\" Max asked me.",
      "But I was thinking it might be Marilee, and sure enough, after my outgoing message Marilee came on and asked, \"Gail? Are you there?\"",
      "This was why I still had an actual, physical answering machine: there were too many people I might not feel like talking to.",
      "\"Because we really need to discuss this,\" Marilee said. \"Could you pick up, please?\"",
      "Max wrinkled his forehead at me.",
      "\"Ignore that,\" I told him.",
      "\"What's going on?\"",
      "\"Nothing's going on.\"",
      "\"Okay ...\"",
      "The answering machine clicked off, and I turned back to the cat. I briefly closed my eyes at her. Cats take that as reassurance; to them it's like a smile. Then I looked off in another direction. I heard a rustle, and when I slid a glance sideways I saw her unfolding herself from the carrier by degrees and stepping gingerly onto the counter. \"A little weight problem,\" I murmured.",
      "As if to demonstrate, she landed on the floor with a noticeable thud.",
      "\"I think it's from stress,\" Max said. \"Apparently she'd been alone for some time before anyone realized her owner had died.\"",
      "I made a sympathetic tsking sound.",
      "\"What's up with Marilee?\" Max asked. He'd never been very good at minding his own business. I said, \"Nothing's up with Marilee.\"",
      "The cat was heading into the living room now, so I made a big show of following her. She paused to sniff at the fringe on the rug and then padded over to an armchair and sprang into it, more nimbly than you might expect.",
      "\"What does she want to discuss?\" Max asked, trailing after me.",
      "I gave up. I said, \"She's retiring in the fall and she wants the board to hire this other person in her place, this Nashville person. And the Nashville person is asking to bring in her own assistant. So I'm thinking I should just quit before they fire me.\"",
      "\"Excellent,\" Max said.",
      "I turned to look at him.",
      "\"Your great talent is for teaching; you know that,\" Max said. \"Dealing with all the kids who are scared to death of math.\"",
      "\"You're forgetting that teachers make no money, though,\" I told him. \"Why else did I put in all that hell time getting my master's degree?\"",
      "\"So? Now that Debbie's finished law school, you can go back to doing what you're good at.\"",
      "\"It's not that simple,\" I told him.",
      "Still, it was nice of him to say that I was good at something. But then he changed the subject. \"Guess I might as well bring in the cat supplies,\" he said. And he went on outside, leaving the front door open behind him even though the air conditioning was on.",
      "I turned back to the cat. She was a bread-loaf shape in the armchair now with her front paws folded beneath her, and when she saw me looking at her she shut her eyes lazily and then opened them again.",

      "Prologue",
      "In the grand scheme of history, it was nothing. A blip, a breath. The time it took Smith to pocket what might have looked like a matchbook or stick of gum to an unwitting child but was, in fact, 0.7 grams of powdered Colombian cocaine \u2014 flown in from Medell\u00edn, cut with amphetamine in Miami, and offered to him in Southampton by a boy he knew from nights out in the city. 0.7 grams heavier, he loped back through the crush of rhythmless elbows and cloying perfume, which wafted up and dissolved in the damp and sultry night \u2014 the very last of summer.",
      "Looking around, it was really just a restaurant. By the front door, at least fifty people huddled, breathing down each other's necks as they shouted the names they hoped would capture the doorman's attention, while in the backyard, hundreds congregated. Dozens of tables now shook with the weight of dancing, bodies alit with the particular mania reserved for the end of East Coast summers, when one becomes aware of the changing season, the coming cold. But for now, it was silk and linen, the expensive musk of strangers. Every face appeared familiar \u2014 some because he actually knew them while others only bore a sun-tanned resemblance, the pleasing symmetry of the rich. These were the faces which seemed to populate the whole of his young life: colleagues and one-night stands from the clubs called cool downtown. These faces had appeared at bars, brunches, birthdays, holiday soirees where black tie was optional \u2014 and, before New York, in freshman seminars and frat parties and before that, on teen tours or tennis camps with their original forms intact, acne-spotted. And here they'd all come, every one of them, to escape the inhospitable heat of Manhattan and enjoy a seaside breeze.",
      "Picture him, stumbling. 6 feet and 3 inches, he towered like a tree, bark-brown and quietly handsome. Picture him crouched in a corner as he snorts from a key, the metallic taste of his tongue. The night gleamed back into clarity as he steadied himself to return \u2014 when out of the crowd, two men emerged, stern eyed and square jawed, barking orders he could barely discern. Calmly, he followed \u2014 he didn't wish to make a scene \u2014 out through a side exit and onto the street, silent but for the bass of a bop that had reigned the charts all summer.",
      "Here is where the night splits open along its tight-stitched seam. The realization, arriving at a tan vehicle marked Southampton Police, that these men, though not in uniform, were not the club security he'd assumed at first they were. The night bent surreally. Smith watched himself be searched as if from a perch above, watched his limbs grow limp and pliant as they bent behind his back. The rotated view of girls in wedges: their clothes wrong, the stars wrong. Yes, the greater sense was not of shock, but unreality. All of this was staged. A prank, a punk \u2013 the actors in the front seat, too handsome to be cops. The men were swift and practiced as they'd bundled him into the back of the car. After he'd handed over five-hundred dollars cash from an ATM upstairs at the station, they took him down to be printed, ID'd, and photographed. They were done in twenty minutes, after which he was handed a slip and his things in a plastic bag, then sent back out into the wounded night. He called an Uber. On the curb, Smith watched phosphenes blinker in the darkness, a chorus of cameras flashing. He'd worn, in his mugshot, a vintage Marni gingham shirt, loose-fit linen trousers, and a gently startled expression.",

      "ONE",
      "What Happened to Kinnick",
      "A prim girl stood still as a fencepost on Rhys Kinnick's front porch. Next to her, a cowlicked boy shifted his weight from snow boot to snow boot. Both kids wore backpacks. On the stairs below them, a woman held an umbrella against the pattering rain.",
      "It was the little girl who'd knocked. Kinnick cracked the door. He rasped through the dirty screen: \"Magazines or chocolate bars?\"",
      "The girl, who looked to be about ten, squinted. \"What did you say?\" Had he misspoken? How long since Kinnick had talked to anyone?",
      "\"I said, what are you fine young capitalists selling? Magazines or chocolate bars?\"",
      "\"We aren't selling anything,\" said the boy. He appeared to be about six. \"We're your grandchildren.\"",
      "A sound came from Kinnick's throat then\u2014a gasp, he might have written it, back when he wrote for a living. Of course they were his grandchildren. He hadn't really looked at their faces. And this strange woman on the steps had thrown him. But now that he did look, he saw family there, in the pronounced upper lip, and the deep-set, searching eyes. No, clearly this was Leah and Asher. Christ! When had he seen them last? He tried to remember, straining to apply an increasingly muddled concept: time. His daughter had brought them up here for a short visit one afternoon. When was that, three years ago? Four?",
      "Either way, these were not strangers selling candy for their school. These were his grandkids, flesh and blood of Rhys Kinnick's flesh and blood, his only child, Bethany. But older than six and ten. More muddled time work was required to figure out how much.",
      "\"Mr. Kinnick?\" The woman with the umbrella was speaking now.",
      "\"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm Kinnick.\" He addressed the kids again. \"Is ... is everything ... Are you ...\" The thoughts came too quickly for his mouth to form around them. He opened the door wider. \"Where's your mother?\" \"We're not sure,\" Leah said. \"Mom left a couple of days ago. She said she'd be back in a week. Shane left yesterday to find her.\" This was thirteen-year-old Leah. Her father was Bethany's old boyfriend Sluggish Doug, long out of the picture.",
      "The boy, eight, no nine! Nine-year-old Asher was S**thead Shane's kid.",
      "Oh, the riddle of time\u2014and of Bethany's taste in men.",
      "Kinnick looked at the woman behind his grandchildren. She was Black, with big round glasses, in her thirties, if he had to guess, roughly his daughter's age. She climbed the last step onto the porch.",
      "\"I'm Anna Gaines,\" the woman said. \"My husband and I live in the same apartment complex as Bethany and Shane. This morning, Leah came over with this.\" She held out an envelope. On it, written in Sharpie in Bethany's handwriting: \"FOR ANNA.\" Below that: \"in case of emergency.\"",
      "\"Mom left it in the closet,\" Leah said, \"in one of my snow boots.\" Kinnick opened the front screen, came out, and took the envelope. He removed a single sheet of paper, handwritten on both sides in Bethany's neat, backward-leaning script. He patted his shirt pocket for his",
      "readers, then squinted to make out the note:",
      "Dear Anna. If you're reading this, I had to leave in a hurry. I know this is a lot to ask but can you take the kids to my father, Rhys Kinnick. He is a recluse ...",
      "Kinnick looked up. \"I am not a recluse.\" He looked down and began reading again.",
      "Dear Anna. If you're reading this, I had to leave in a hurry. I know this is a lot to ask but can you take the kids to my father, Rhys Kinnick. He is a recluse who cut off contact with our family ...",
      "\"I did not 'cut off contact.' It was\u2014\" Rhys felt his blood rising. \"Complicated.\" But his grandchildren just stared at him, apparently as uninterested in nuance and complexity as everyone else in the world. Kinnick grunted again and went back to reading.",
      "Dear Anna. If you're reading this, I had to leave in a hurry. I know this is a lot to ask but can you take the kids to my father, Rhys Kinnick. He is a recluse who cut off contact with our family and now lives in squalor ...",
      "\"Squalor?\" Kinnick looked around his covered front porch. \"Squalor?\" In one corner, a broken old refrigerator stood next to a stack of used boat and car batteries and a burned-out inverter generator; in the other corner was his old wringer washing machine and a single clothesline, from which hung a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt. \"What is this? In case of emergency, go find my father and make him feel terrible about himself?\"",
      "His grandchildren continued to stare. Kinnick groaned again, then resumed reading, vowing to make it through the whole letter this time.",

      "Written in multiple perspectives, \"A Summer for the Books\" (to be published July 15 by MIRA) tells of two old friends \u2013 Jewel, a bestselling writer, and Shelby, a bookstore owner \u2013 who went their separate ways years ago ... but! When Shelby loses her memory after a bike accident and reaches out to Jewel for help, how can she refuse?",

      "Sitting up in bed with her laptop on her thighs and her husband asleep next to her, Jewel McRae, known to the world as Jewel Stone, closed out the deleted scene of her debut novel, That Was Then, and leaned back onto the headboard. She'd just received word her book was going to be made into a series on a major network, and they wanted her on set as a consultant when they went into production next summer, which was why she was rereading the book. It was a chore, but fortunately, years had passed since its release, and it was all new to her again.",
      "The network planned to create at least two seasons, so she was reading through her very first draft that even her agent and editor had never seen. It included about 17,000 words that were later cut, including the baby storyline. Her editor had never read that juicy subplot, and if Jewel continued to have her way, nobody ever would.",
      "Honestly, though it was tedious work, the book-to-series was quite an accomplishment and a cause for celebration. Her followers were on social media posting memes and making actor suggestions.",
      "But her celebration was bittersweet. The one person she wanted to share this with, her best friend since childhood, was no longer a friend. And the contents of this book were a part of the reason. Especially the deleted contents. Jewel didn't have the courage to share her truth with anyone, especially the man asleep next to her.",
      "Releasing a huge sigh, she placed the laptop on her nightstand and massaged the back of her neck. With a yawn, she settled under the covers, and her final thought before fading out was I miss my friend.",

      "The National Institutes of Health is the world's largest source of funding for medical research. It has also undergone huge budget cuts in recent weeks imposed by the Trump administration, which prompts thoughts from Dr. Timothy Johnson, long-time ABC News medical editor and founding editor of the Harvard Medical School Health Letter:",
      "Over the course of my long career in medical journalism, I had the great privilege of getting to know many of the leading medical researchers in this country. They were typically people of great integrity who had dedicated themselves to the often-frustrating and tedious task of painstaking research to find new cures and preventions for important medical problems. And the bottom line for many of them was that, without government support, they could never have achieved the discoveries that have helped us all.",
      "Which is why I am stunned by a recent report that states the Trump administration's National Institutes of Health has stopped payments on grants totaling more than $1.8 billion for nearly 700 specific medical research projects.",
      "This sledgehammer approach will cause terrible damage to many outstanding research programs, and it will destroy the careers of many young medical scientists just starting their research. These are dedicated people who have already put in many years of difficult training and may be on the cusp of some major discoveries.",

    "summary": "Authorities in Hong Kong say COVID-19 levels are the worst in at least a year.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",
      "Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through emergency room visits and wastewater testing.",
      "\"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern,\" Thornburg said, citing a \"seasonality analysis\" that the agency has been working on about the virus.",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-rate-funtionally-unemployed-economy/",
    "published": "Mon, 26 May 2025 15:53:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Many workers aren't working as much as they'd like. Here's what one expert says the federal unemployment rate fails to capture.",
    "story": [
      "While the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, another measure of worker well-being indicates there may be bigger cracks in the labor market.",
      "The low unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in April, has signaled to economists and investors alike that the U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Employers are also continuing to hire despite headwinds like tariffs and plunging consumer confidence.",
      "But another indicator suggests those pieces of government data may be painting an overly rosy picture of the economy, with a recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finding the \"true rate\" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, up slightly from 24% in March, while the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate remained unchanged at 4.2% over the same period.",
      "LISEP's measure encompasses not only unemployed workers, but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. By tracking functionally unemployed workers, the measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion.",
      "\"The unemployment data, as it's put out, has some flaws,\" LISEP chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"For example, it counts you as employed if you've worked as little as one hour over the prior two weeks. So you can be homeless and in a tent community and have worked one hour and be counted, irrespective of how poorly-paid that hour may be.\"",
      "LISEP, in a working paper on the gauge, says the measure prevents part-time jobs or poorly paid work from being counted as equal to full-time and better-paid work. LISEP also argues that the unemployment rate \"presents a very incomplete and, in many ways, misleading picture.\"",
      "In other words, people who lack steady work and don't earn living wages shouldn't be counted as functionally employed. Its True Rate of Unemployment (TRU), which began tracking the measure in 2020, encapsulates workers whose earnings don't allow them to make ends meet, and are struggling just to get by, according to LISEP.",
      "\"If you're part time and can't get a full-time job, then we count you as functionally unemployed,\" Ludwig noted. \"We also count as functionally unemployed people who don't earn above a poverty wage.\"",
      "\"Survival mode\"",
      "In so doing, it counts workers who can't afford to put roofs over their heads, can't procure nuturious meals and don't have the ability to save as being functionally unemployed.",
      "\"You don't have anything that gets you to the first rung of the American dream ladder. You're in survival mode,\" Ludwig said.",
      "When broken down by race and gender, TRU shows Hispanic, Black and women workers faring worse than White workers, as well as men.",
      "More than 28% of Hispanic workers, and nearly 27% of Black workers are functionally unemployed, compared to 23% of White workers. And more female workers \u2014 28.6% \u2014 are functionally unemployed than male workers, whose true rate of unemployment stands at 20%, according to LISEP.",
      "Millions of households are currently struggling to maintain a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to another recent analysis from LISEP.",
      "Its research found that the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living. These households earned an average of $38,000 per year in 2023, but would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "The wide chasm between the the BLS's measure of unemployment and its true rate of unemployment is also concerning, according to Ludwig.",
      "\"If you say there's 4.2% unemployment, which makes political folks happy because it's a low number, it causes all kinds of poor policy decisions and assumes we are better off than we are,\" Ludwig said. \"There's less energy and less of a push to improve employment, and the people who get hurt are middle- and low-income Americans.\"",

      "\"I am considering taking Three Billion Dollars of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land. What a great investment that would be for the USA, and so badly needed!!!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trade schools focus on teaching practical skills for specific trades or professions.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how Mr. Trump would shift the money, and if the grants come from the Harvard funding that his administration has already frozen.",
      "Mr. Trump issued the fresh threat after he moved last week to block Harvard from enrolling international students and has taken other steps to freeze billions of dollars in Harvard's federal funding, as he claims the institution has not done enough to address anti-semitism on campus.",
      "Harvard didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Last week, Harvard filed a second lawsuit over the\u00a0Trump administration's attempt\u00a0to bar it from enrolling foreign students. Harvard President Alan Garber had called it a \"revocation\" that \"continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body.\"",

    "summary": "The World Travel & Tourism Council projects international visitors will spend $169 billion in 2025, a nearly 7% decrease from last year.",
    "story": [
      "Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan is a small city with a thriving economy. That's because visitors from its larger northern sister city in Ontario, Canada, keep the border town's economy humming.",
      "Situated on opposite sides of the St. Marys River, the U.S. and Canadian counterparts are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, over which thousands of vehicles pass each month.",
      "\"It's so intertwined,\" said Linda Hoath, executive director of the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau, who noted that many people have family members on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. \"There's no separation between the two communities,\" she said.",
      "But with the U.S. trade war unleashed against Canada\u00a0in recent months\u00a0\u2014 along with reports of detentions of travelers at the Canadian border by U.S. immigration authorities and threats of annexation by\u00a0President Trump, the chasm between the two neighbors has grown, as fewer Canadians make the trip south to the United States.",
      "According to Sault Ste. Marie's International Bridge Administration, the passenger car traffic in April was down 44% compared with last year. And while the waning bridge traffic may not mean much from the view of Canada's second-largest province and most popular\u00a0destination, to the historic Michigan town it certainly does.",
      "\"They have 70,000 people,\" Hoath said. \"And if they're not coming over and buying in our stores, then it affects us much more.\"",
      "Slowdown in travel to the U.S.",
      "Sault Ste. Marie is not alone in its tourism concerns. Though travel this Memorial Day weekend is expected to be the highest on record, one group has been noticeably absent at U.S. travel checkpoints in recent months: international travelers.",
      "International travel to the U.S.\u00a0fell 14% in March\u00a0compared with the same period last year, according to the the U.S. Travel Association. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest dip in travel, 20.2%, was from Canada, according to research from Tourism Economics, a unit of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Trudeau urged Canadians to\u00a0refrain from vacationing in the U.S., after Mr. Trump slapped a 25% tariff\u00a0on Canadian goods. The drop-off in Canadian travel is a notable shift, given that Canada was the biggest source of inbound travel to the U.S. last year, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "As to what's behind the overall slowdown in international travel to the U.S., experts point to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, the strength of the U.S. dollar and long visa wait times. Aggressive tariff policies have also left a bad taste in many travelers' mouths.",
      "\"Shifting sentiment and perceptions of the U.S. are expected to continue to weigh heavily on travel demand,\" said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.",
      "As of April, flight bookings to the U.S. for the May\u2013July travel window are 10.8% lower than they were the same period last year, according to the research firm. It projects an 8.7% decline in international arrivals in 2025.",
      "Economic Impact",
      "The slowdown in international travel threatens to destabilize America's tourism industry which plays a vital role in supporting the nation's economy.",
      "\"International inbound travel is hugely important from an economic standpoint \u2014 people that come to the U.S. and visit spend on average $4,000 per visit,\" a spokesperson from the U.S. Travel Association, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those dollars may already be slipping away: The World Travel & Tourism Council projects that spending by international visitors to the U.S. will drop to $169 billion, or 7%, this year, from $181 billion in 2024. That's a 22.5% decrease from peak tourist spending of $217 billion in 2019, before the pandemic.",
      "Fewer international travelers could also take a toll on the workforce that props up America's tourism industry: Nearly 10% of American jobs are tied to the travel industry, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "An ongoing decline in international travel to the U.S. could result in a loss of over 230,000 jobs \u2014 with the dining and lodging industries expected to be the most hard hit, according to a recent analysis from the economic research firm IMPLAN.",
      "\"It's not going to devastate the U.S. economy in terms of GDP, but it is very significant in terms of employment,\" Jenny Thorvaldson, IMPLAN's chief economist and data officer, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hoath, who runs the visitor center in Sault Ste. Marie, said she is already worried about what those losses could mean for her community.",
      "\"When we're looking at the bridge and it's packed, people have to get their employees together,\" she said. \"But if it's not so busy, what happens to your employees? They're not making the money. Some people will be laid off.\"",
      "Hotel bookings in the city of 14,000 are already down 77% year to date, according to the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau.",
      "Shifting focus to domestic travelers",
      "As international tourism dampens, local communities like Flagstaff, Arizona, are rerouting their attention to domestic travelers.",
      "Despite the city's wide international appeal, the travel season has gotten off to a slow start. Flagstaff has seen a 15% to 20% drop in international tourists year over year, according to Trace Ward, director of Flagstaff's Convention and Visitors Bureau.",
      "While he hopes that decline will only be temporary, Ward is looking for ways to bring in more American tourists. One strategy he has in mind is adding more direct flights to the area and possibly attracting a new airline. The city is also promoting its\u00a0Lowell Observatory's new Astronomy Discovery Center, which offers visitors a glimpse of the cosmos.",
      "\"I look forward to the excitement of the international traveler coming back full steam, but until then, we're gonna sell to whoever is interested in coming here,\" Ward said.",
      "Hoath, likewise, has shifted her focus toward attracting visitors from within the States, and has decided to halt spending on any advertising in Canada.",

    "story": [
      "When you picture a garage sale, you might think of your neighbor's driveway down the street, not an aviation workshop in the shadow of the world's busiest airport, where Delta Air Lines holds their monthly surplus sale.",
      "Delta fans came from as far as Michigan and even Korea to buy the stuff the airline no longer needs, from seats to engine parts. It's a chance, these folks say, to own a piece of airline history. And how would they get the stuff home? \"We actually flew down with empty bags,\" said one man.",
      "Sarah Zeis came in search of a particular piece of Delta history: a well-used beverage cart. \"I actually need a bar cart in my apartment of these exact dimensions,\" she said.",
      "Getting it home will be a journey all its own.",
      "Proceeds from the sale go right across the parking lot, to the Delta Flight Museum, now celebrating the airline's 100th year \u2013 a first for an American carrier.",
      "It's a century of service that started without beverage carts \u2026 or passengers!",
      "According to archives director Marie Force, Delta owes its existence to a tiny pest: the boll weevil. \"It is the most unique beginning of a U.S. airline, I think,\" she said. \"It's the only airline that started as a crop-dusting company\"",
      "Before Delta, there was Huff-Daland Dusters, started in 1925 in Macon, Georgia. Force said, \"After the first growing season, they realized that most of the center of the business was in the Mississippi Delta region. And so, that's where the name Delta comes from.\"",
      "And in 1929, Delta Air Lines' founder C.E. Woolman expanded the company from pest control to people. Its first passenger flight was from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with two stops in Louisiana along the way. A ticket cost $90 round trip \u2013 about $1,700 today. Expensive, and not for everyone. Force said, \"At that time, about 80% of Delta's passengers were businessmen\" \u2013 people trying to speed up a trip that took 12 hours by train to a five-hour flight.",
      "Nearly a century after that first flight, Delta now has more than 5,000 flights a day. The airline has survived mergers, recessions, and bankruptcy, growing from that single route to a nationwide carrier, and the global force we know today.",
      "\"Glamour personified\"",
      "If you've flown Delta lately, you've seen flight attendant Susan Slater in the pre-flight safety video. If you've flown Delta in the last 60 years, you may have shared a cabin with either Slater (who started with the airline on March 2, 1964) or Kay Carpenter (who started in January 1966). It was the \"Golden Age\" of air travel, that romanticized era of flights with exceptional service, extravagant meals, and everyone dressed to the nines.",
      "Back then, said Slater, \"You had to be unmarried. Your hair couldn't touch your collar. You had a weight restriction. Back then I think I weighed 103 pounds and I was 5 foot 2-and-a-half. I'm five feet now, barely, and not 103!\"",
      "I asked, \"What was it about the job that you think spoke to you so much?\"",
      "\"All I knew was that this was glamour personified,\" Slater replied.",
      "Atmosphere Research Group's Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, says there is no need to be so quite so nostalgic: \"We certainly had a so-called Golden Age of flying back in the early 1960s,\" he said. \"But it was less convenient. There were fewer flights. You often had to connect. And it certainly wasn't as reliable and safe as it is today.",
      "\"We're in the new type of Golden Age now, where flying is a lot more accessible,\" he said. \"You can either buy or create a much nice journey for yourself. You can buy an extra leg room seat. You can pay for priority boarding. And by the way, if you don't need or value those things or perhaps can't afford it, you're not being charged for services that you don't want.\"",
      "Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said, \"Air travel is one of the great bargains. If you think about the average fare today versus where it was 30, 40 years ago, it's less than half of what you pay in real dollars.\"",
      "While low fares are sought after by some fliers, Delta has built its business around a premium experience, according to Bastian: \"The single biggest reason why people chose an airline was fare; whoever had the lowest cost won.

      "Their 100th summer is about to take flight, amid clouds of uncertainty \u2026 worries about a slowing economy and aviation safety. But Bastian says it could still be their busiest ever, as he looks to the future.",
      "So, what does he see for Delta's next hundred years? \"When you think in the United States, you know, air travel is relatively ubiquitous \u2013 you jump on a plane almost any hour of the day and get to almost anywhere you want, you know, pretty, pretty easily,\" Bastian said. \"However, when you think about the world, and you realize that only one in five people in the world has even been on an airplane, it's pretty remarkable. We need to figure out ways to make it accessible, to make it affordable, to make it sustainable.\"",
      "I said, \"Part of that legacy is just how much the world has shrunk in those 100 years.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's what we do,\" Bastian said. \"We make the world a more connected place, a smaller place. And that's needed now more than ever.\"",
      "While Delta helped shrink the world in the 20th century, they hope their own growth continues, thanks to folks like Susan Slater and Kay Carpenter.",
      "\"It's been a wonderful adventure,\" Carpenter said. \"I never dreamed that I would be here for this long. When I started, we had just small airplanes. We flew to small cities. And now we fly to six continents. So, I tell all these new hire flight attendants to always remember that one mile on a highway is going to take you exactly one mile.

      "The supermarket chain Publix has recalled fruit and vegetable baby food sold in eight states because product testing found elevated levels of lead, according to federal health officials.",
      "Publix recalled 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold at more than 1,400 stores.",
      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",
      "The potential contamination was flagged by officials in North Carolina, the state that first identified a 2023 lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches that sickened more than 500 U.S. children.",
      "Routine sampling of the baby food pouches found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, according to North Carolina agriculture officials. That exceeds the FDA's recommended limit of 10 parts per billion for such products intended for babies and young children.",
      "Publix said all the potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves. No illnesses have been reported, the company said. Customers can return the pouches to local stores for full refund.",
      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",
      "Federal health officials eventually identified 566 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of lead poisoning tied to the pouches in 44 states.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Sat, 24 May 2025 08:15:01 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he'll decide soon whether to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public \u2014 a move that was vocally sought by Trump ally Bill Ackman.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said this week he may take home lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president says he'll decide \"in the near future\" whether to try again, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data. Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

      "The agreement stems from the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019.

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The massive budget bill passed by the House includes new tax breaks for tipped workers and those who get overtime.",
    "story": [
      "The massive Republican-backed budget bill \u2014 called \"one big, beautiful bill\" by President Trump \u2014 includes several new tax rules that could have a big financial impact on millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay.",
      "While the heart of the bill is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the legislation also includes several provisions that were part of the president's campaign last year, such as his vow to eliminate taxes on tipped income.",
      "The bill could deliver savings of about $1,700 for each tipped worker as well as employees who earn overtime, the House Ways and Means Committee said on May 20. But there are some restrictions in the bill that could limit the financial boon for these workers, with some policy experts saying that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear.",
      "For instance, almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax, according to the Brookings Institution. Consequently, the tax break is likely to provide a bigger helping hand to higher-paid tipped workers, while leaving some low-income workers behind.",
      "\"If your goal is to help the poorest service workers, this is probably not the way to do it,\" said Michael Lynn, a professor of services marketing at Cornell University whose research largely focuses on tipping and other consumer behavior.",
      "The 1,100-page bill, which squeaked through the House on Thursday by a single vote, will now go to the Senate, where more changes are likely. Here's what to know about the provisions as they now stand.",
      "How would the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision work?",
      "Called the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision within the House bill, the rule would create a new tax deduction that eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people who work in jobs that have traditionally received them.",
      "There are about 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, or about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The tax break includes some restrictions:",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.\u00a0Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.\u00a0The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.",
      "Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.",
      "Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.",
      "The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.",
      "The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "\"The tip exemption will significantly increase take-home pay for most tipped workers, many of whom are low- to middle-income taxpayers,\" the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), a group that advises the president on economic issues, said in a report published earlier this month.",
      "The CEA's report estimates that the average take-home pay for tipped workers would increase by $1,675 per year under the provision.",
      "Would it help all tipped workers?",
      "No, because 4 in 10 tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income taxes, which means they wouldn't see any benefit. There's also a concern that some employers could reclassify some workers as tipped workers by arguing they would receive a tax break, according to Brookings.",
      "The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, versus $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.",
      "One Fair Wage, an advocacy group representing service workers, criticized the measure, noting that the GOP bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs that many tipped workers rely on. \"It also slashes Medicaid, putting 1.2 million restaurant workers at risk of losing health care,\" One Fair Wage posted on social media.",
      "What about the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act?",
      "A separate, standalone bill called the No Tax on Tips Act, which is solely focused on giving a tax break to tipped workers, was passed by the Senate on May 20, with bipartisan support. That bill will now move to the House for a vote.",
      "The Senate bill offers similar benefits and restrictions as the \"one big, beautiful bill\" when it comes to taxes and tips, but with one major difference: The bigger GOP bill requires workers, as well as their spouses, to have a Social Security number.",
      "That requirement appears to be aimed at excluding some immigrants from tapping the tax break, while the Senate bill doesn't stipulate that taxpayers who claim this break, or their spouses, must have a Social Security number.",
      "Senator Jackie Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, urged lawmakers to pass the Not Tax on Tips Act arguing in a statement that the bigger GOP bill combines the tax break with cuts to vital programs like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"We shouldn't be forcing working families to choose between keeping their health care or keeping their tips, which is why we want this bipartisan bill on its own \u2014 on its own \u2014 not part of a harmful, extreme budget bill,\" Rosen said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.",
      "How does the \"No Tax on Overtime\" provision work?",
      "The GOP bill includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime, another one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises.",
      "About 8% of hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers receive overtime pay on a regular basis, according to the Yale Budget Lab. About 70% of salaried workers don't qualify for overtime pay, it noted.",
      "The legislation would enable workers to claim a deduction on their taxes for the amount they earned in overtime pay during the tax year, although there are some restrictions:",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.",
      "The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "But more guidelines about the provision would still need to be determined by the Treasury Department, according to tax firm Wolters Kluwer in a May 22 publication about the tax bill.",

And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",

    "summary": "A GOP tax-and-spending bill the House approved Thursday would slash federal Medicaid reimbursement for states that offer health coverage to immigrants without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants \u2014 often children \u2014 regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.",
      "But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.",
      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding \u2014 about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.",
      "California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Mr. Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.",
      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",

      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",

In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",

      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025 and Jan. 1, 2029 with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program. The U.S. Treasury would set up and fund the accounts.",
      "Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, said automatic enrollment is a key component of the proposed pilot program, given some adults' unfamiliarity with such investment vehicles. Some of the lowest-income families, who could most benefit from the boost, \"often don't know about these kinds of programs. There's a huge awareness gap,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Automatic enrollment is fundamental to improving the likelihood that it reaches the lowest-income families,\" she added.",
      "What would be in a \"Trump account\"?",
      "The government would contribute $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market on their behalf. Families and third parties could also contribute up to $5,000 a year to a child's account.",
      "Sam Taube, investment expert at personal finance site Nerdwallet, said the proposed \"Trump accounts\" are similar to programs currently offered by a number of states, but the contributions aren't as generous. For instance Colorado's First Step program awards every newborn $100 in a 529 college savings account, plus a match of $500 a year for the first five years of savings, totaling up to $2,500 in gift contributions.",
      "What could the money be spent on?",
      "Accountholders would only be approved to be spend investment funds on prescribed costs, such as a down payment on a home, education-related expenses, or starting a small business. Use of the funds to pay for unapproved expenses would subject accountholders to penalties.",
      "But broadening the scope of approved expenditures would be even more beneficial to many families, Brown noted.",
      "\"When it comes to wealth building, we have to make sure the target sums that kids end up with at 18 are in line with the things we're saying you can use the money for,\" Brown explained.",
      "If lower-income accountholders' families can't contribute the additional $5,000 per year, the sum they would end up with as adults might not cover a down payment, for example.",
      "\"There are lots of different projections around what $1,000 can grow to with different interest rates, but it's not a down payment,\" she said. \"So unless additional contributions come from the community, the federal government or state governments, we're not likely to see these accounts grow to the sums that we're saying are qualified uses.",
      "When could the funds be withdrawn?",
      "Half of the funds could be withdrawn when a child turns 18, at which point the account's gains would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, so long as the money were spent as directed. If the funds were used for other purposes, withdrawals would be taxed as income. A 10% penalty for misspending the money could also apply. Accountholders would have access to their full balances between the ages of 25-30 for approved purposes, and after 30, would be able to withdraw the funds for any purpose.",
      "Brown said she thinks improvements could be made to the way the program is structured, particularly around how account withdrawals are taxed. She noted that the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.",
      "Most Americans can't afford a $1,000 emergency expense, according to a January report from Bankrate, making low-earners more likely to need to tap into the funds for surprise costs.",
      "\"They are the most likely to have to withdraw dollars for nonqualified expenses, and in doing so, they [would] receive a tax penalty. So there are ways to exempt emergency expenses, and that would be a fix,\" Brown said.",
      "Otherwise, she said, the upsides to the accounts are limited. \"There are other places you can save money where you won't have that tax penalty if you withdraw the funds early,\" Brown said.",
      "Taube of Nerdwallet noted that the proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable.",
      "\"Although they are advertised as tax-advantaged accounts, the way they work does not seem to be that different from how a taxable brokerage account would work,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That said, \"given the state of saving for children's future expenses in this country, the accounts do seem like they could help at least somewhat,\" Taube said.",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salt-deduction-cap-trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-40000-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 15:03:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",
      "The $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade, when compared with keeping the $10,000 cap in place, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania nonpartisan group that analyzes the fiscal impact of policy.",
      "That adds to the cost of a bill that has been criticized by some experts\u00a0and lawmakers as introducing new tax breaks that could outstrip any savings in the legislation and trillions to the U.S. debt.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model \"has projected that America will face certain risk of a fiscal crisis within the next two decades, eroding household purchasing power, unless action is taken to reduce federal deficits,\" Kent Smetters, head of the group, said in a email after the House passed the budget package.",

      "The average price of fast food in larger U.S. cities is now in the double digits, with the typical meal costing $11.56, according to a new\u00a0report from LendingTree. Prices are highest in San Francisco, where the average fast-food meal costs $13.88, followed by Seattle at $13.48. Columbus, Ohio, has the most affordable fast food, but meals still came to $10.01 on average.",
      "Fast food has long been considered a more economical, if not more healthful, way to eat. Whether it's Wendy's \"Biggie Bag\" or McDonald's \"McValue\" menu, most major fast-food chains offer some sort of meal deal for under $10. But as costs rise and inflation pinches Americans' wallets, the cost of burgers, fries and chicken nuggets may be slipping out of reach for many consumers.",
      "A FinanceBuzz analysis\u00a0found last year that average fast-food prices have risen between 39% and 100% over the last decade. For example, a McDouble sandwich that cost $1.19 in 2014 would easily cost more than $3 in 2024, the personal finance site found.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles II will address Canada's Parliament on Tuesday, a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with tariffs and annexation threats by President Trump.",
      "The British monarch, who formally serves as Canada's head of state, arrived in the capital of Ottawa on Monday, part of a two-day visit that's widely viewed as a form of pushback against Mr. Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Why is King Charles speaking to Canada's parliament?",
      "The king is delivering a \"Speech from the Throne,\" which marks the start of a new session of Parliament after the center-left Liberal Party won last month's federal election. The speech \u2014 written by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office, not the king \u2014 will lay out the new government's agenda and priorities.",
      "Marking the start of Parliament with a speech is a longstanding tradition in Canada and other former parts of the British Empire \u2014 but it's highly unusual for the king to deliver the speech himself. Instead, the king's representative in Canada, the governor-general, normally speaks on his behalf. The last time the monarch personally gave the speech was in 1977, when Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0traveled to Canada's capital for the event.",
      "The speech will take place at 11 a.m. EDT on Tuesday.",
      "Is King Charles' visit to Ottawa related to Trump?",
      "Some watchers of Canadian politics think so, especially as Mr. Trump has repeatedly mused about the United States annexing Canada, stirring strong backlash.",
      "Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta, says the royal visit could be \"an indication that the king takes Canada's sovereignty seriously.\"",
      "\"The explicit threats to Canada's sovereignty probably got the attention of the king and his advisers,\" Wesley told CBS News.",
      "The visit could also play to domestic politics, Wesley says. Mr. Trump's comments have \"stirred up patriotism in some odd corners of Canada,\" and the country's status as a constitutional monarchy where the king is still technically the head of state is one major difference between Canada and its neighbor to the south. And even though most Canadians are fairly indifferent toward the monarchy, visits by royals always draw interest.",
      "\"It's seen as a point of pride and distinction between Canada and the U.S.,\" said Wesley, who previously served in several roles for Alberta's provincial government.",
      "University of Toronto political science professor Elizabeth McCallion said the visit is likely intended as a \"reminder that we are an independent country\" and a \"rallying together of Canadians.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Carney told Sky News the invitation to Charles was \"not coincidental.\" In a statement welcoming Charles on Monday, the prime minister didn't mention Mr. Trump, but did hint at Canada's \"distinct identity\" and \"historic ties that crises only fortify.\"",
      "Charles also has a longstanding relationship with Canada, visiting the country over a dozen times before ascending to the throne. Amid a rocky relationship with the United States, many Canadians have looked for signs of support from Charles, taking note of symbolic gestures like the crown's decision to plant a maple tree at Buckingham Palace earlier this year, McCallion said.",
      "McCallion says some Canadians also believe Mr. Trump's longstanding fascination with the British royal family could play to the country's benefit.",
      "\"There's hope that when he's visiting, Trump will take notice and respect the fact that Canada has connections to the British monarchy,\" McCallion told CBS News.",
      "Charles is the head of state for both Canada and the U.K., putting him in an unusual position as the U.K. seeks a stronger trade relationship with the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Carney criticized the U.K. government for inviting Mr. Trump to a state visit earlier this year, presenting Mr. Trump with an invitation from the king. The Canadian leader told Sky News most Canadians \"weren't impressed by that gesture.\"",
      "What could King Charles say in the speech \u2014 and will he mention Trump?",
      "McCallion thinks the speech to Parliament is unlikely to name Mr. Trump overtly \u2014 but it could mention Canada's sovereignty. \"Everybody knows what it means in this context,\" she said.",
      "The speech could have more explicit references to the U.S.-Canada trade relationship, though, as Mr. Trump threatens steep tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "\"I'm not saying that there should be a drinking game attached to it, but if there were \u2026 I think every time you heard the term 'reset' in relation to the relationship between Canada and the United States, [that] would be deserving of a drink,\" Wesley said.",
      "The speech could also reference other parts of Carney's agenda, with nods to his promise to make Canada an \"energy superpower\" and his plans around affordability, Wesley notes.",
      "Also worth watching: After the speech, Parliament will hold a debate and an up-or-down vote on the government's agenda. If the vote fails, another federal election could be necessary \u2014 but both McCallion and Wesley said that's highly unlikely.",
      "What has Trump said about Canada \u2014 and how has Carney responded?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated annexing Canada in recent months, rattling Canadian politics.",
      "The 51st-state jabs sometimes appear tongue-in-cheek: Mr. Trump referred to Carney's predecessor \u2014 who stepped down as prime minister ahead of new elections this year \u2014 as \"Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.\" In other cases, Mr. Trump has cast absorbing Canada as a tidy way of resolving the U.S.'s trade deficit with its northern neighbor.",
      "But Trudeau has reportedly called Mr. Trump's talk of absorbing Canada \"a real thing,\" telling business and labor leaders in a private meeting that he sees taking over Canada as a way of getting access to the country's mineral wealth, according to the public broadcaster CBC. Many Canadian voters hold the same view, according to McCallion.",
      "\"I think maybe the first or second time, people were offended but thought he was kidding. And at this point, certainly no Canadians think he's kidding,\" McCallion said. \"Most Canadians are taking it as a serious threat.\"",
      "When asked whether he would use military force to take over Canada, Mr. Trump said earlier this month, \"I don't see it.\" But in a White House meeting with Carney days later, the U.S. leader still called the idea of annexing Canada a \"wonderful marriage\" that would deliver \"tremendous\" benefits to Canada, and referred to the border between the two countries as \"artificial.\"",
      "Carney said in the meeting Canada \"won't be for sale, ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on many Canadian goods, leading Canada to hit the U.S. with retaliatory levies.",
      "Last month's Canadian elections were dominated by Mr. Trump's tariffs and annexation comments, and the race was widely seen as a referendum on who Canadians trusted more to deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Carney's Liberal Party \u2014 which has held power for almost a decade \u2014 previously trailed the Conservatives in polling, but its fortunes rebounded after Mr. Trump's jabs at Canada. In a victory speech, Carney said the country's \"old relationship with the United States \u2026 is over,\" and argued Mr. Trump is \"trying to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "\"Our national identity is at times muddied because it's made up of so many different cultures that have come together,\" McCallion told CBS News. \"Often, Canadians primarily express their national identity as not being American.\"",

      "Former Culpeper County Sheriff Jenkins, 53, was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in March. But on Monday, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Jenkins and his family \"have been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.\"",
      "\"This Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn't deserve to spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left \"monsters,\" and \"left for dead,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Jenkins' attorneys for comment.",
      "Jenkins was indicted in 2023 on 16 counts. In December, a jury found Jenkins guilty of one count of conspiracy, four counts of honest services fraud and seven counts of bribery. Jenkins appealed his conviction in April.",
      "Federal prosecutors say Jenkins took $75,000 worth of bribes. He allegedly accepted cash and campaign contributions from eight people \u2014 including two undercover FBI agents \u2014 and in return, gave them badges and made them auxiliary deputy sheriffs, despite not having any training or vetting. He also allegedly pushed officials to restore one bribe-payer's right to possess a gun as a convicted felon.",
      "Jenkins took the stand in his own defense and said there was no connection between the payments he received and the badges he handed out, according to news reports. Testifying against Jenkins were the undercover FBI agents who were sworn in as deputies in 2022 and immediately thereafter gave Jenkins envelopes with $5,000 and $10,000 cash, respectively.",
      "Trump said Jenkins tried to offer evidence in his defense, but U.S. District Judge Robert Ballou, a Biden appointee, \"refused to allow it, shut him down, and then went on a tirade.\"",
      "Acting United States Attorney Zachary T. Lee said at the time that Jenkins violated his oath of office \"and this case proves that when those officials use their authority for unjust personal enrichment, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable.\"",
      "A longstanding Trump supporter, Jenkins is the latest ally of the president to receive a pardon.",
      "On Mr. Trump's first day in office, he granted pardons and commutations to more than 1,000 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",

Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell Barack Obama's Senate seat, and Michelle Fiore, a Las Vegas politician and loyal Trump backer convicted of paying for plastic surgery and other personal expenses with money intended to build a statue for a slain police officer.",

But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.\"",

      "No suspect has ever publicly been named, although earlier this year, investigators released security camera video showing the suspect sitting on a park bench, reaching into his backpack and planting a pipe bomb outside the DNC.",
      "According to a report obtained by CBS News in March 2021, the bombs contained only one method of detonation \u2014 a 60-minute kitchen timer. The devices did not go off, and when and whether they were meant to explode remains unclear. But the FBI said its analysis concluded the pipe bombs were viable and posed a danger to the public.",
      "Another case Bongino plans to reexamine is the 2022 leak of the Supreme Court's draft opinion in the Dobbs case, which sought to overturn the 1973 Roe decision that made abortion legal nationwide. A draft opinion of a Supreme Court had never before been leaked, and at the time, Chief Justice John Roberts denounced the leak as a \"betrayal\"\u00a0and \"a singular and egregious betrayal of trust\" that would be fully investigated.",
      "An eight-month investigation was conducted by the marshal of the Supreme Court, who consulted with former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, but investigators were unable to find the leaker.",
      "In a 20-page report released with a Supreme Court statement saying the leaker could not be identified, Marshal of the Supreme Court Gail Curley said it is \"unlikely\" the leak stemmed from a hack of the court's IT systems by a person outside the court. But after examining the Supreme Court's computer devices, networks, printers and available call and text logs, investigators found \"no forensic evidence indicating who disclosed the draft opinion.\"",
      "The final case cited by Bongino was the discovery of cocaine at the White House on July 2, 2023. The Secret Service closed the investigation after 11 days, saying it had compiled a list of \"several hundred\" people who may have accessed the area where the substance was discovered. But no fingerprints could be found on the cocaine's packaging and there was \"insufficient DNA\" for \"investigative comparisons,\" the Secret Service said at the time.",

      "President Trump on Monday visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and delivered remarks at Arlington National Cemetery to commemorate\u00a0Memorial Day\u00a0by honoring those who have died while serving their country.",
      "\"Every day the Republic stands is only possible because of those who did what had to be done when duty called,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Our debt to them is eternal, and it does not diminish with time. It only grows and grows and grows with each passing year. The greatest monument to their courage is not carved in marble or cast in bronze. It's all around us, an American nation, 325 million strong.\"",
      "Before his remarks, the president laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a somber annual tradition for presidents, and one Mr. Trump participated in during his first term as president. He was accompanied by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who stood behind him as he placed the wreath.",
      "\"Each life honored here in Arlington was once full of the ordinary moments and quiet dreams of early sunrises, of good days and bad days, of celebrations and disappointments,\" Vance said. \"For my fellow Americans, especially those watching on television, consider the sum of all the moments that make a good life, and now appreciate that countless strangers \u2014 people most of you never met \u2014 they gave up those moments in their own life so that we could enjoy them in ours. And that is what Memorial Day is all about.\"",
      "Early Monday, Mr. Trump posted a message on his social media platform Truth Social about Memorial Day, writing in all caps that he wished a \"happy Memorial Day to all,\" including the \"scum that spent the last four years trying to destroy our country through warped radical left minds.\" He went on to target immigration policies and accused \"USA-hating judges who suffer from an ideology that is sick, and very dangerous for our country\" of protecting criminals.",
      "Memorial Day honors those who died in uniform as a result of battle. Since the Revolutionary War, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates more than 650,000 U.S. military personnel have died in battle.",
      "The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, completed in 1932, represents the burial site of a soldier from World War I whose remains could not be identified. Unknown remains from later wars were added in 1958 and 1984.",
      "Earlier this month, the president proclaimed on Truth Social that the U.S. will designate new holidays to commemorate the end of World War I and World War II in Europe.",
      "\"All over the World, the Allies are celebrating the Victory we had in World War II. The only Country that doesn't celebrate is the United States of America, and the Victory was only accomplished because of us,\" Mr. Trump said in that post.",
      "\"I am hereby declaring a National Holiday in celebration of the Victories of World War I, where the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, and World War II, where the Victory date was May 8, 1945,\" he wrote.",
      "Nov. 11 is already a federal holiday, known as Veterans Day. May, 8, 1945, is generally known as Victory in Europe Day, or V-E Day, since the war in the Pacific lasted until the Japanese surrendered, which was announced on Aug. 14, 1945.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 May 2025 04:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson shepherded through Congress President Trump's spending bill, which includes Medicaid work requirements.",
    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who shepherded President Trump's \"one big, beautiful bill\" through Congress, said Sunday that the Medicaid work requirements \u2014 which could affect his home state of Louisiana \u2014 have a \"moral component\" to them because people on Medicaid who \"refuse\" to work are \"defrauding the system.\"",
      "\"If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system,\" Johnson said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"You're cheating the system. And no one in the country believes that that's right. So there's a moral component to what we're doing. And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\"",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed the massive bill, which sets priorities for Mr. Trump's agenda for upcoming budgets, by just one vote in the early hours Thursday after an all-night session. The bill is now headed to the Senate, where several Republicans have already voiced concerns, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Rand Paul.",
      "The bill went through intense debate in two committees last week as an alliance of blue-state Republicans and fiscal hawks refused to budge. Given Republicans' razor-thin majority in the House, Mr. Trump went to the Hill on Tuesday to rally the holdouts in the GOP conference.",
      "To pay for some of Mr. Trump's tax reforms, such as extending his 2017 tax cuts and eliminating tax on tips, there are cuts to several programs. Republicans have insisted they are not cutting Medicaid, and reductions in the low-income entitlement program have become one of the most charged parts of the bill. In a closed-door session Tuesday with members of the Republican conference, sources in the room told CBS News Mr. Trump said, \"Don't f*** around with Medicaid.\"",
      "To save money on Medicaid, the final version of the bill puts work requirements on Medicaid, which Johnson has insisted will account for the bulk of any cost-cutting. An analysis by the health\u00a0care nonprofit KFF found that 190,000 people in Louisiana, Johnson's home state, stand to lose Medicaid under new requirements.",
      "Johnson insisted on Sunday that \"we have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP,\" the food stamp program.",
      "\"What we're doing \u2026 is working on fraud, waste and abuse, and everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress,\" Johnson said.",
      "He said there are 4.8 million Americans on Medicaid who are \"able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system.\" Calling it a \"moral component\" to put Americans to work, he added, \"when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\"",
      "Johnson also claimed some of those who are on Medicaid and SNAP are undocumented immigrants, although they are not eligible to receive food stamps or Medicaid.",
      "When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed back for Johnson to clarify that his position is that the estimated 190,000 Louisianans who stand to lose Medicaid coverage are \"lazy, not working? That they were undocumented? What about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?\"",
      "\"No. What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said. \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all.\"",
      "Johnson said the Medicaid work requirements are \"not some onerous, burdensome thing,\" saying they require recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week \u2014 either working, be in job training programs or volunteering in the community.",
      "\"When the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it,\" Johnson said. \"This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of. And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, should agree to.\"",
      "But as the bill heads to the Senate for debate, the GOP's Hawley has called it \"both morally wrong and politically suicidal\" to slash Medicaid, indicating brewing opposition to it in that chamber.",
      "Hawley particularly took issue with a cost-sharing measure with Medicaid between federal and state governments, which he said would force those at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit. Johnson pushed back on that claim, saying that the House included in the bill a \"modest state-sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud.\"",
      "But as Brennan noted, the bill still has to pass the Senate, and if Senators make the expected changes to the bill, it will have to go back to the House. Johnson said he had lunch with his Republican counterparts in the upper chamber on Tuesday, and he said he reminded them that they are a team.",
      "\"It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this ball over the goal line, so to speak,\" Johnson said. \"And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed.",
      "Well, you got this massive tax and border bill through, just barely, one vote margin. You pulled an all-nighter.",
      "Among other things, it will eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, put about $50 billion towards the border wall and hiring Border Patrol agents, keep in place existing individual tax rates, create savings accounts for kids with a one-time deposit of $1,000, increase the child tax credit by about 500 bucks.",
      "The \u2013 the bill on this is estimated to be between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade. How much do you think this is all going to cost?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, that's about the right estimate.",
      "But, at the same time, we have historic savings for the American people, cuts to government to make it more efficient and effective and \u2013 and work better for the people. That was a big campaign promise of President Trump and a big promise of ours, and we're going to achieve that.",
      "So, in the calculation here, there's more than $1.5 trillion in savings, Margaret, for the people. And that's \u2013 that's the largest amount \u2013 biggest cut in government really in at least 30 years and, if you adjust for inflation, probably the largest in the history of government.",
      "So we're proud of what we produced here. We've checked all the boxes, where all the things that you mentioned in existence \u2013 in addition to American energy dominance, investing in our military industrial base, which is appropriate for us to talk about this weekend, and so many other priorities.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, it's not an economic gamble.",
      "It's a big investment. And, look, this \u2013 what this bill is going to do is be jet fuel to the U.S. economy. It is going to foster a pro-growth economy. What do we mean by that? Because we're reducing taxes. We're reducing regulations. We're going to increase and incentivize American manufacturing again.",
      "And what will \u2013 the effect this will have in the economy is that entrepreneurs and risk-takers and job creators will have an easier time in doing that. They will allow for more jobs and more opportunity for more people, and wages will increase.",
      "Now, Margaret, this is not a theoretical exercise. We did this already in the first Trump administration. After just the first two years, we brought about the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the U.S., because we did it, followed a very simple formula. We cut taxes and we cut regulations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't do it in the middle of a tariff war.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: This time, we're doing that on steroids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the first administration, there was sequencing.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No. Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got tax reform. The Republicans got tax reform through and held off the tariff war.",
      "Goldman Sachs says, the hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package. That's Goldman Sachs.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well \u2013 well, I know. I respect Goldman Sachs, but I think what they're discounting here is the growth that will be spurred on by this legislation and the fact that the so-called tariff war is beginning to subside already.",
      "You've got over 75 countries that are negotiating new, more fair trade agreements for the U.S. right now because of the president's insistence that that be done. And it was decades overdue. That is going to benefit every American. It's going to benefit the consumers.",
      "You know, they howled when the first tariffs \u2013 reciprocal tariffs policy was announced. And they said that prices would skyrocket. That simply hasn't happened. Many of those early estimates were far off, and that's being proven now.",
      "So what I think will happen is the tariffs, you know, contest will subside. This legislation will pass and get the economy going again. And people will feel that. They'll see it in their own pocketbooks, in their own opportunity. And every American household is going to benefit by these policies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know Walmart has already said that it will have to raise prices. It's not theoretical. And the president on Friday was talking about even more tariffs, this time on Apple and others.",
      "But back \u2013 back to your end of the \u2013 of the deal here, for this tax relief, you talked about the cuts to pay for it all. You are eliminating subsidized federal student loans, so the government will no longer cover the interest on debt while borrowers are in school. You're eliminating $500 billion in clean energy subsidies and you're terminating early tax breaks for electric vehicles.",
      "Alongside that, you're carrying out about a trillion in reductions to Medicaid and food stamps. We looked at your home state, and the projection is that nearly 200,000 Louisianians will lose their Medicaid coverage because of this. How do you defend that to your constituents?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP.",
      "What we're doing, Margaret, is working on fraud, waste and abuse. And everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress. Just in \u2013 in Medicaid, for example, you've got 1.4 million illegal aliens receiving those benefits. That is not what Medicaid is intended for.",
      "It's intended for vulnerable populations, for young, single, pregnant women and the elderly and the disabled and people who desperately need those resources. Right now, they're being drained by fraud, waste and abuse.",
      "You've got about 4.8 million people on Medicaid right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system. If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system.",
      "And no one in the country believes that that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: So there's a \u2013 there's a moral component to what we're doing.",
      "And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: It's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, but in \u2013 first of all, just undocumented immigrants, you know, are not eligible for food stamps or Medicaid. Some\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: And yet they're receiving them. That's the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 lawfully present immigrants are.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, what we're talking about, again, is able- bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system.",
      "And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all. By the way, the work requirements, Margaret, is not some onerous, burdensome thing. It's a minimum of 20 hours a week. You could either be working or be in a job program, a job training program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: \u2026 or \u2013 or volunteering in your community. This is not some \u2013 some onerous thing. This is common sense.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: My friend Josh Hawley is a fiscal conservative, as I am. We don't want to slash benefits.",
      "And, again, I make this very clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. We are not cutting SNAP. We're working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP, for example, listen to the statistics.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Louisiana is like the second largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir. So\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Let me explain it, Margaret. Let me explain it.",
      "The states \u2013 the states are not properly administering this, because they don't have enough skin in the game. So what we've done in the bill is add some \u2013 just a modest state sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud.",
      "Why? Again, so that it is preserved for the people that need it the most. This is common sense, Margaret. It's good government, and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Hawley objects to that cost-sharing language.",
      "He is the one leveraging that criticism. This is going to change, you know that, when it goes to the Senate.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Listen, right. So, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you \u2013 how do you put Republicans up to have to defend these things, when they are facing an election in 17 months?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We got almost every vote in the House because we worked on it for more than a year in finding the exact balance of reforms to the programs, so that we can save them and secure them.",
      "I think \u2013 I think Senator Hawley will see that when he looks into the details of what we passed on Thursday. This is a big thing. It's an historic thing, once-in-a-generation legislation. We call it the one big, beautiful bill because it's going to do so much and the America first agenda will be delivered for the people just as we promised.",
      "And, look, I had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team. It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this \u2013 this ball over the goal line, so to speak.",
      "And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Yes, well, you have \u2013 you have five to six Republicans from high tax states who are not going to want to see that change in the state and local tax deductions. And there's not a commitment to that in the Senate. Can you still get this through the House without SALT?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Look, we \u2013 there's got to be a modification to SALT.",
      "And, as I have explained to my Senate colleagues many times, you know, they don't have SALT Caucus in the Senate because they're all from red states, but in the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents.",
      "Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House. And so this is political reality. We'd love to cut more costs. We'd love to do even more, but we have to deal within the realm of possibility.",
      "And I think this is a huge leap forward for fiscal responsibility, for a government that's effective and accountable to the people and real relief for hardworking Americans, and they well deserve it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, before I let you go, I want to ask you about another provision that was tucked into this bill. Democrats say it is weakening separation of powers and punishing the courts. It's a specific provision that would restrict a federal court's power to enforce injunctions with contempt, unless there was a bond attached to it.",
      "Sounds really weedy, but it's causing a lot of outcry. If this might get stripped out in the Senate anyway, why did you bother to stick it in?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, we bothered to stick it in because that's our responsibility in Congress.",
      "It is about separation of powers. And, right now, you have activist judges, a handful of them around the country, who are abusing that power. They're issuing these nationwide injunctions. They're \u2013 they're engaging in political acts from the bench.",
      "And that is not what our system is intended for. And people have lost their \u2013 their \u2013 their faith in our system of justice. We have to restore it. And bringing about a simple reform like that is something that I think everybody should applaud.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the speaker. I know you did not vote for this bill. But, you know, Connecticut has one of the highest state and local tax burdens in the country. Do you at least like that one little portion of this bill?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: That one little portion is going to be good for my constituents.",
      "But, Margaret, I \u2013 I got to tell you, it was like listening to \"1984\" or something listening to the speaker. You know, anybody can look this up. The American people want basically three things out of their federal budget. Number one, at this point in time, when Americans \u2013 the wealthiest Americans, are doing better than ever before, Americans want the wealthiest of the \u2013 of Americans to pay more taxes and to give tax relief to the middle class and below.",
      "Number two, they want us to address the deficit, which is now spiraling out of control, to the point where we got a downgrade in one of the U.S. credit ratings. And, third, they want a simpler tax code.",
      "This bill fails spectacularly on all three counts. They're cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance, food stamps, to tens of millions of Americans in order to preserve tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They're adding $3 trillion to the deficit with this bill. And, lastly, they're gumming up the tax code with, you don't have to pay taxes on tips. Now, what about the folks who don't earn tips, you know, auto lending?",
      "I mean, again, on the three things that Americans care most about, that they want the Congress to do, this bill fails spectacularly. Look, and that's going to show up in the polling pretty soon, as Americans come to realize what it is that the House of Representatives just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your other role on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "When it comes to what the president has vowed to do to Russia, he floated this idea two weeks ago of possible sanctions if Russia doesn't stop its war in Ukraine. But then he spoke to Vladimir Putin on Monday, and we heard nothing about sanctions. We did hear from the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency that this war is trending in favor of Russia.",
      "What changes need to be made, if anything, to how the U.S. provides support?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, Margaret, look, we're at a fork in the road with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "And, you know, Donald Trump and his acolytes in the Congress will go along with one of these two choices. Either we will continue the trajectory that started when the president and the vice president humiliated Vladimir \u2013 humiliated President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and paused aid, and Vladimir Putin will learn from that experience that he can count on the U.S. to support his murderous incursions into neighboring countries.",
      "Or we can take another path, which I hope the president will take, which is to say, what we need to do right now is generate maximum leverage against Vladimir Putin, and I see the president getting a little frustrated by him.",
      "But that maximum leverage comes because we really uptick the sanctions, we stop the export of oil, we pressure India to stop buying Russian oil, and, of course, we keep arming the Ukrainians. Again, for this guy who considers himself the master of the deal, maximize the leverage of the West so that we can bring this war not just to a conclusion, but to a fair and just conclusion that will keep the Russians from invading countries in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your role on the Intelligence Committee, you get to see things the public does not.",
      "With that in mind, the president has designated this Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, TDA, as a foreign terrorist organization. He says they're invading the country. He's using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members without a day in court.",
      "Part of the legal justification of all of this rests on the claim that the Venezuelan government is controlling what TDA is doing. The National Intelligence Council assessed the Maduro government does not control the gang.",
      "But, on this program last Sunday, the secretary of state rejected that. He says he favors the FBI's finding, which is that some members of the Venezuelan government do influence the gang.",
      "Why does all of this matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it matters, Margaret, because I will remind you that, in the George W. Bush administration, exactly what is happening right now happened.",
      "It was a different topic. Right now, despite the conclusions of the intelligence community, the president, the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state are saying that Venezuela directs Tren de Aragua.",
      "Now, they're saying that because they need this no due process mechanism of deporting people, the Alien Enemies Act, which, by the way, the courts are now laughing at.",
      "But the reason it matters, Margaret, is because the last time the White House did this, when they were determined that the intelligence community be forced to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which there turned out not to be, 4,400 American servicemen perished in a war that was fought on false pretenses, not to mention, by the way, the many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who perished in that war, which was a catastrophic strategic mistake driven by the politicization, the \u2013 the notion that George W. Bush had that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.",
      "That's why intelligence matters. There's 4,400 families in this country who lost people because the White House decided they would override the conclusion of their $90 billion-a-year intelligence community. That's what Marco Rubio is doing, that's what the president is doing, and that's what Director Gabbard are doing when they contradict what their own organization is telling them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that point, this is also becoming an issue for Joe Kent, who is the president's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center.",
      "He's under scrutiny because e-mails show that, while acting as chief of staff to DNI Gabbard, he pressed analysts to amend an assessment of links between the government and TDA.",
      "According to redacted e-mails that my network has obtained, he wrote: \"We need to do some rewriting, a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" the president of the United States. He says: \"We need to incorporate the FBI's assessment.\"",
      "You have now read these declassified e-mails as well. Do you believe that Joe Kent was just asking for more context?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: No, he absolutely was not. And I have seen the redacted e-mails. He was pressuring the National Intelligence Council to alter their conclusions.",
      "And, look, he gave away the game. You just read the line. He told us why he did that, so that this report would not be used against the president or the director of national intelligence. Think about that. The chief of staff of the \u2013 of the Office of the Director National Intelligence wasn't saying, we need the very best intelligence here. We need you to go back and make sure you're 100 percent true.",
      "He was saying, we need to make sure that your product is not used to embarrass the president and the director of national intelligence. That is the very definition, the very definition of politicizing intelligence. This is not about embarrassing or not embarrassing anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Again, back to those 4,400 dead Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, no, Joe Kent must never be confirmed for any Senate-confirmed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, it's all out there for the Senate to see. So, no, he may \u2013 he must never be confirmed for any Senate-confirmed position because of what he did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. And those e-mails are available for the public to read as well.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In Gaza we have this manmade catastrophe with Israeli authorities blocking the entry of all aid from March until about May 18th. The Trump administration said Israel needs to let in food.",
      "So, are your deliveries consistently now getting through?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, let's start with the fact that this is a catastrophe. And you're absolutely correct, and I'm very grateful that you are covering this issue. They have let a few trucks in. This is a drop in the bucket as to what's needed.",
      "Right now we have 500,000 people inside of Gaza that are \u2013 that are extremely food insecure and could be on the verge of famine if we don't help bring them back from that. We need to get in and we need to get in at scale, not just a few dribble of the trucks. Right now it's, as I said, it's a drop in the bucket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how many trucks need to be getting in daily to address the scale of the need you see? And \u2013 and can they get into northern Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, prior to the \u2013 you know, during the ceasefire, I should say, we were getting in 600 trucks a day. Right now we're getting in maybe 100. Something like that. So, it \u2013 it's not nearly enough. And it needs to be going to the correct places. So, the various gates. It's inconsistent as to how the gates are open. It's inconsistent as to the roads we can use. The roads that are the better roads. The ones that can get us further along aren't open at all much. It's complicated right now. And \u2013 and again, I will tell anybody who will listen, we need to get in and get in at scale and be allowed to feed these people before further catastrophe occurs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your organization announced at least 15 of your trucks were looted when they entered southern Gaza on route to \u2013 to bakeries. Israel has consistently said that the looting is being carried out by Hamas. Have you seen evidence that it is Hamas stealing the food?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: No, not at all. Not \u2013 not in this round.",
      "Listen, these people are desperate. And they see a World Food Programme truck coming in and they run for it. This \u2013 this doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death.",
      "And so, we will continue to go in. We will continue to go in with food and the kinds of supplies that we need to help the bakeries operate and make sure that we can continue to do that and \u2013 and hopefully be able to do more of it.",
      "But, again, we can't do this unless the world community puts pressure on this. We can't be allowed to sit back and watch these people starve to death with no outside diplomatic influence to help us. These \u2013 these \u2013 these poor souls are really, really, really desperate. And, you know, having been in \u2013 in a food riot myself some years ago, I understand the desperation very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, five days ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take control of all of Gaza, which seems to be a shift from going in, carrying out raids and then withdrawing. We've seen the pope speak out. We've seen the leaders of France, of Canada, of the U.K. calling the cutting of aid egregious. Netanyahu said criticism like that is feeding Hamas and really feeding anti-Semitism.",
      "What do you make of that pushback from him, that criticisms of the state are feeding hate?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: What I do know is they're not feeding people. And the most important part of this is that's what we're supposed to be doing.",
      "I'm very grateful for anyone, the pope, any of the folks that did \u2013 did shout out and say, listen, we need to get more in. But I can't tell you as to what \u2013 exactly what Netanyahu's thinking or anything else.",
      "What I do know for a fact is that we need food to get into Gaza to avoid an utter catastrophe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli army had announced aid will be distributed under what they described as an American plan. Prime Minister Netanyahu said it will be American companies giving food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. There's reporting in \"The Washington Post\" that these are armed private contractors doing logistics. Palestinians will have to submit to identity checks to be fed. And that would replace the U.N. coordinated networks, presumably also the World Food Programme.",
      "Do you know how much longer you will be allowed to operate in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: I have not seen a plan from anybody. We continue to operate doing what we do best. And we are the largest and the best at what we do, I might add. I \u2013 we've never been \u2013 a plan has never been proposed to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We haven't heard in \u2013 in the press at least from the administration any of the details either. But we do know that the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, announced back on May 9th that this is going to be a U.S. initiative involving only Israeli security. The Israelis are not distributing food.",
      "Secretary Rubio was just in Rome. He said he did meet with you. Did you share with him any of your concerns?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, we had a very frank discussion about exactly what was going on and what we could do to help alleviate a lot of this. Some of it, I'm not sure that they were completely clear on how we operate and the size that we are and the logistics ability that we have to be able to do this. So \u2013 so, we had a \u2013 a very nice discussion. As you know, the Rubio family and \u2013 and the McCain family have been friends for a very long time. And so I was grateful that he would take the time to listen to what \u2013 what we had to say and let us discuss exactly how we feel we should be able to operate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he assure you that the U.S. supports the U.N. and the World Food Programme continuing to supply food in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We didn't really discuss the U.S. participation in any of this. He was really \u2013 really concerned with and really trying to understand how we operate and \u2013 and the need for what exactly what we do. We will work with anybody as long as it feeds people, and feeds people safely, I might add, on the ground and keeps our people and people from other agencies safe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Executive director of the World Food Programme, Cindy McCain. Thank you for your time this morning.",

      "Good to have you here.",
      "JACK MCCAIN (Afghanistan War Combat Veteran): Thank you. I'm incredibly glad to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we know, when you were in Afghanistan, you flew alongside and helped to train some of the Afghan Black Hawk pilots. Why is it important to you now to speak out on their behalf? Are any of your personal contacts there at risk?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Yes. Basically everyone that we were unable to get out is at risk. These pilots and crew members fought the Taliban toe to toe. And because of that, the Taliban is trying to seek them out for reprisal. Something that they distinctly promised that they would not do.",
      "So, not only are they \u2013 are they in danger, but we owe them a debt.",
      "I believe that I'm vertical and still on this earth because of the efforts of my Afghan pilots and crews. And not only do I owe them personally, but the nation owes them a debt of honor. One that we have yet to repay.",
      "Everyone, interpreters, ground troops, pilots, that worked and fought alongside the United States at our behest should be able to be evacuated here to the United States and should be taken care of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you were active duty at the time of the very chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I know you helped to get Afghans out during that period of time. There were a lot of Afghans airlifted out. Who was left behind and \u2013 and what promises were made?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Yes, the problem is everyone was left behind. Whether it was family members, including family members of U.S. servicemen, whether it was pilots, crews, the people that I worked with, special forces, we did everything we could to get as many as we could out. But due to the chaos of the withdrawal and, frankly, the lack of planning on the part of the United States government, it was up to individuals and sometimes smaller military units to help either, in my case I had to triage who we were going to take out. I had to prioritize operational pilots over pilots in training versus crew members in the back simply because everyone was trying to do everything they could.",
      "So, we have tens of thousands that fought alongside us left behind. Each one of them in danger in their own way. Not to mention family members that can be used as tools of leverage against those that are even here in the United States now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to that point, under the Taliban right now, the daughters, the wives, the female family members of a lot of these people who worked with Americans are facing some pretty tough conditions. However, this administration just recently said through Homeland Security that it is safe for Afghans to return. So those here could be sent back. Some Afghans who had arrived here and been given temporary protection.",
      "Does what the U.S. government said match in any way what you are hearing is happening on the ground?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: I would disagree with the entire notion that it is safe for anyone, especially if they've been in the United States, to return to rule under the Taliban. Whether they are male, female, young, old, that regime has proven itself to be \u2013 to not only have gone back on every promise they made to us, but to be \u2013 to have no problem using human lives as pawns to imprison, torture, rape, kill, even sell into slavery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there are a number of veterans of the war in Afghanistan who serve currently as lawmakers in the United States Congress. And it is Congress that sets the number of visas for these \u2013 these special immigrant visas, SIVs. We checked. There are more than 144,000 applicants in the pipeline, but there are only 11,000 visas left. That's not even counting family members here.",
      "Have you gotten any indication from the lawmakers you know that they are going to raise that cap?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: No, I have not. And it is an utter travesty that that is the case. People on both sides of the aisle had \u2013 have served in Afghanistan or have fought alongside Afghans, much like me. And the political theater that has taken place of simply ignoring the problem can only be summarized by the word despicable.",
      "This is an issue of humanity. This is an issue of national honor. And this is a debt that we owe. So, I would urge lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to solve this problem because it is not going to go away. It is your job to legislate, so, please do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's in the hand of lawmakers. That was a problem even during the last administration. Now, though, we have this extra complication where the Trump administration has put in orders to restrict refugee admissions and said the U.S. should prioritize people who can, quote, \"fully and appropriately assimilate and who do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.\" That's made it hard for Afghan refugees, family members to enter here.",
      "How do you reassure the public that these refugees are not a risk? Even the vice president of the United States has said he does not trust the vetting of refugees.",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Well, I mean, I think I passed the ultimate test in that I literally put my lives in \u2013 my life in these people's hands. So, not only are they worthy of trust, but they are worthy of our care.",
      "The vetting process has taken place. It continues to take place. And if vetting is the issue, fantastic. Let's pass legislation to solve that problem. Let's make sure everyone up to this point has been vetted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, your father famously said, \"it matters less that you can fight, but what you fight for is the real test.\" I know you feel passionately about this particular issue. Can you ever see yourself entering politics to fight for other issues?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: That's a \u2013 a very interesting question. One that I happen to get asked fairly regularly. And I would say trying to follow his example that the best life is one lived adventurously and in service of a cause greater than one's self interest. I'm doing that. And if someday that does take me to office in service of the nation, then by all means. But to live a life simply focused on the single goal of attaining public office is not in my mind a life purposefully lived, in \u2013 in service in office, it is a purposefully lived one, but that should not be the overriding goal of your life.",

But we are moving, I believe, there with that (INAUDIBLE) in particular in the right direction, not only with pay, but looking at broader quality of life issues, housing, childcare that's available on our installations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: America spends more than any other country on its defense. How is it possible we have this happening to our troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN, (R-IA): We've tried to work together on things that not only help veterans, leading a veteran's suicide bill, assistance to families in the military. I'm proud the bill that we just passed is going to be able to extent a 22 percent tax cut to military families. I'm proud that we got a child tax credit in there. I'm thrilled that we were able to get our bill in there that worked towards giving a family a tax credit for adoption. We've got two adopted kids. This goes a long ways to helping a middle American family, whether you're military or not, be successful going forward.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: But I want to also say, it's important to do all of this for recruitment, retention, addressing quality of life. We recruit families. But also, when I think about being right here, at the Vietnam Memorial, and I think about our service, my service, you don't do it for the money, you do it because you love the country.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: That's right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: So, because of that love for the country, realizing that families are fighting for our country, the service members and their families, we have to continue to just look and \u2013 at prioritizing our military families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you tell people now, encourage them to enter public service, at a time when they're being told, even by the federal government \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The private sector is going to be more rewarding for you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Look, Margaret, I think you highlight a really important part here. There's a number of ways that people can be called to serve. It's one of the things that I think has actually made us most combat effective in Congress is finding people who are mission oriented, who are working together. I tell my kids, the things that they could potentially learn in the military will echo throughout their entire life. But it's up for every American to make that decision, that pathway.",
      "You're right, less than 1 percent of Americans are serving. That 1 percent distinguishes itself time and time again.",
      "And there's lots of great ways to public service. Don and I have worked together to get more teachers, more nurses, more doctors. There's all great calls to public service. The federal government has a role to play in this, but ultimately it's up to Americans to decide how do they best give back to the communities that they represent? We certainly felt that military service was a way to do it, but I think we came to it in our own pathway.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: Yes, and I would love to say to any young person listening right now that's remotely interested, I had an amazing career serving in the United States Air Force. I love serving our country. And it was definitely a great career for me. And now as a member of the Armed Services Committee, we're doing everything to continue to make sure all of our branches are vibrant and we're doing things to make sure we support them. Give it a shot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, we talk about the Vietnam War and the memorial behind you. There are it looks like students coming to reflect this morning. Three million people died in that war, 58,000 Americans among them. I wonder this Memorial Day, who are you thinking of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Look, this isn't ancient history. This is living history. I think of my uncle who flew spotter planes over Vietnam. I think of my dad, who had the choice between enlisting or joining the ROTC program. I also think about my mother, who got \u2013 back home taking care of, you know, at that point, her career as a nurse. Ay aunt, who had two little girls. These are the stories that I think it's so important that young people do have the opportunity to learn about. One, so we never enter this kind of a situation again where we send men and women off to fight and they come back home, not to a hero's welcome, but as a despised class. Peace through strength is a real deterrent. But also knowing that we've got a military that when we commit to fight, we have to go in there knowing that we have a strategy, a plan, and that we're not going to be bringing people home injured, broken or shattered to a country not ready to receive them.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: It's so warming to see young people, kids walking through and looking at the Vietnam Memorial. I think of those throughout my community back home in eastern North Carolina, who I know served our country during Vietnam.",
      "And I go beyond Vietnam. I think of Corporal Ryan Russell, who's from east North Carolina, who was killed in Iraq. And I have a special relationship with his mom, Kathy. And we're doing everything to commemorate those who were killed, not just Vietnam, but in all wars and conflicts so that they know the \u2013 that the families, that we're standing with them. There's a way to get through this, this healing process that so many families are going through, those tears, that they're not alone.",
      "But not only that, but to embrace nationally when we see this, to think about all those who ultimately gave their lives in service of our country.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. But on behalf of all of us here at FACE THE NATION, to our military, our veterans, and especially their families, thank you for your service. We are all in your debt.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Navy veteran Jack McCain that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 25, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 And we're back with another McCain. Jack McCain is the son of Cindy and the late Senator John McCain. He's a Navy veteran who served in the Afghanistan War, and he joins us now from Kyoto, Japan. Good to have you here.",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Thank you. I'm incredibly glad to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we know when you were in Afghanistan, you flew alongside and helped to train some of the Afghan Black Hawk pilots. Why is it important to you now to speak out on their behalf? Are any of your personal contacts there at risk?",
      "MCCAIN: Yes, basically everyone that we were unable to get out is at risk. These pilots and crew members fought the Taliban toe to toe, and because of that, the Taliban is trying to seek them out for reprisal, something that they distinctly promised that they would not do. So not only they- are they in danger, but we owe them a debt. I believe that I'm vertical and still on this earth because of the efforts of my Afghan pilots and crews. And not only do I owe them personally, but the nation owes them a debt of honor, one that we have yet to repay. Everyone, interpreters, ground troop pilots that worked and fought alongside the United States at our behest, should be able to be evacuated here to the United States and should be taken care of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were active duty at the time of the very chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I know you helped to get Afghans out. During that period of time, there were a lot of Afghans airlifted out. Who was left behind and what promises were made?",
      "MCCAIN: Yeah, the problem is everyone was left behind, whether it was family members, including family members of U.S. servicemen, whether it was pilots, crews, the people that I worked with, special forces. We did everything we could to get as many as we could out. But through the chaos of the withdrawal and frankly, the lack of planning on the part of the United States government, it was up to individuals and sometimes smaller military units to help either- in my case, I had to triage who we were going to take out. I had to prioritize operational pilots over pilots in training, versus crew members in the back, simply because everyone was trying to do everything they could. So we have tens of thousands that fought alongside us left behind, each one of them in danger in their own way, not to mention family members that can be used as tools of leverage against those that are even here in the United States now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to that point: under the Taliban right now, women aren't even allowed to speak in public. They can't go to school over the sixth- past the sixth grade. They're not allowed to work. So the daughters, the wives, the female family members of a lot of these people who worked with Americans are facing some pretty tough conditions. However, this administration just recently said through Homeland Security that it is safe for Afghans to return. So those here could be sent back, some Afghans who had arrived here and been given temporary protection. Does what the U.S. government said match in any way what you are hearing is happening on the ground?",
      "MCCAIN: I would disagree with the entire notion that it is safe for anyone, especially if they've been in the United States, to return to rule under the Taliban. Whether they are, male, female, young, old, that regime has proven itself to be- to not only have gone back on every promise they made to us, but to be- to have no problem using human lives as pawns to imprison, torture, rape, kill, even sell into slavery. So no, I disagree that Afghanistan is safe for anybody, much less those that fought on behalf of the United States. My pilots were doing gun runs on Taliban positions as they were moving forward on the base in Kandahar. I would say that they have a score- the Taliban have a score they'd like to settle. So absolutely, not unequivocally, it is not safe to return.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there are a number of veterans of the war in Afghanistan who serve currently as lawmakers in the United States Congress. And it is Congress that sets the number of visas for the- these Special Immigrant Visas, SIVs. We checked, there are more than 144,000 applicants in the pipeline, but there are only 11,000 visas left. So that's not even counting family members here. Have you gotten any indication from the lawmakers you know that they are going to raise that cap?",
      "MCCAIN: No, I have not, and it is an utter travesty that that is the case. People on both sides of the aisle had- have served in Afghanistan or fought alongside Afghans, much like me, and the political theater that has taken place of simply ignoring the problem can only be summarized by the word despicable. This is an issue of humanity. This is an issue of national honor, and this is a debt that we owe. So I would urge lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to solve this problem, because it is not going to go away. It is your job to legislate, so please do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So that's in the hand of lawmakers. That was a problem even during the last administration. Now though, we have this extra complication where the Trump administration has put in orders to restrict refugee admissions and said the U.S. should prioritize people who can, quote, \"fully and appropriately assimilate and who do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.\" That's made it hard for Afghan refugees, family members to enter here. How do you reassure the public that these refugees are not a risk? Even the Vice President of the United States has said he does not trust the vetting of refugees.",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I mean, I think I passed the ultimate test in that I literally put my lives in- my life in these peoples' hands. So not only are they worthy of trust, but they are worthy of our care. The vetting process has taken place. It continues to take place. And if vetting is the issue, fantastic. Let's pass legislation to solve that problem. Let's make sure everyone up to this point has been vetted. But if there's something else that would make anyone on any side of the aisle feel safer, then great, there's a solution for this. It's called the legislative process. So I would urge lawmakers to do the one job that they're paid by the American people to do, and to solve the problem that we have created ourselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Secretary Rubio testified this week that he will follow the letter of the law as written by Congress. Congress had established a program to help pay for the Afghans to be resettled here. It's the CARE Program at the State Department, but now the program is no longer paying the way for these Afghans. How difficult is it for some of the Afghans you know to pay to get their wife, their family members here?",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 These people were taken from their country with only the clothes on their back in about 99% of cases. They were dumped off into locations that they were unfamiliar with, and as much as service members and the government did an amazing amount to try to support them, it's still not enough. When you imagine the massive change in their lives, not to mention the fact that their entire country and family has now been shattered as a result of American action. It is beyond difficult. I have individuals who are combat wounded, who have extreme injuries that make them almost unable to work, and it's not like I can send them to the VA despite the fact that they got shot at on behalf of the American government. So I would say that life is extremely difficult, but those individuals are of great resolve, and they are doing everything they can to overcome and to become great Americans, the great Americans that I know they will be, and that anybody that knows them personally knows them to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 There have been a few investigations of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, by the Pentagon, by the State Department. They have found fault with the Biden administration. They have found fault with the first Trump administration. This past week, Secretary Hegseth announced he's going to do a new investigation of it all. That it will be led by his spokesperson. It's unclear why that person in particular. What do you think was missing from those original reviews?",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 I don't think anything is missing from those original reviews, and I don't think that going back over the process of the withdrawal is going to solve any of the very real problems that exist today. It was political theater the first time, it is political theater the second time, and it is political theater yet again. This does nothing to solve the problem that we created. This does nothing to make the lives of Afghans better. This does nothing to help stabilize the region. It is simply the Biden administration pointing the finger at the Trump administration, the Trump administration pointing the finger at the Biden administration. It's happening all over again. This is a useless waste of effort, but frankly, it is one that I see continuing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Before I let you go. Your father famously said it matters less that you can fight, but what you fight for is the real test. I know you feel passionately about this particular issue. Can you ever see yourself entering politics to fight for other issues?",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 That's a very interesting question, one that I happen to get asked fairly regularly. And I would say, trying to follow his example, that the best life is one lived adventurously, and if- in service of a cause greater than one's self interest. I'm doing that, and if someday that does take me to office, in service of the nation, then by all means. But to live a life simply focused on the single goal of attaining public office is not, in my mind, a life purposefully lived. In service and in office, it is a purposefully lived one, but that should not be the overriding goal of your life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We will continue watching. Jack McCain, thank you for weighing in on this important issue.",
      "MCCAIN: Thank you so much.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and he joins us today from Greenwich, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the speaker. I know you did not vote for this bill. But you know, Connecticut has one of the highest state and local tax burdens in the country. Do you at least like that one little portion of this bill?",
      "REP. HIMES: That one little portion is going to be good for my constituents, but Margaret, I- I got to tell you, it was like listening to \"1984\" or something, listening to the speaker. You know, anybody can look this up, the American people want basically three things out of their federal budget. Number one, at this point in time when Americans, the wealthiest Americans, are doing better than ever before, Americans want the wealthiest of the Amer- of Americans to pay more taxes, and to give tax relief to the middle class and below. Number two, they want us to address the deficit, which is now spiraling out of control to the point where we got a downgrade in one of the U.S. credit ratings. And third, they want a simpler tax code. This bill spe- fails spectacularly on all three counts. They're cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance, food stamps, to tens of millions of Americans in order to preserve tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They're adding $3 trillion to the deficit with this bill. And lastly, they're gumming up the tax code with, you don't have to pay taxes on tips. Now, what about the folks who don't earn tips? You know, auto lending. I mean, again, on the three things that Americans care most about, that they want the Congress to do, this bill fails spectacularly. Look, and that's going to show up in the polling pretty soon, as Americans come to realize what it is that the House of Representatives just did .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your other role on the House Intelligence Committee. When it comes to what the President has vowed to do to Russia, he floated this idea two weeks ago of possible sanctions if Russia doesn't stop its war in Ukraine. But then he spoke to Vladimir Putin on Monday, and we heard nothing about sanctions. We did hear from the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency that this war is trending in favor of Russia. What changes need to be made, if anything, to how the U.S. provides support?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, Margaret, look, we're at a fork in the road with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war. And you know, Donald Trump and his acolytes in the Congress will go along with one of these two choices: either we will continue the trajectory that started when the president and the vice president humiliated Vladimir- humiliated President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and paused aid, and Vladimir Putin will learn from that experience that he can count on the U.S. to support his murderous incursions into neighboring countries. Or we can take another path, which I hope the president will take, which is to say, what we need to do right now is generate maximum leverage against Vladimir Putin, and I see the president getting a little frustrated by him, but that maximum leverage comes because we really uptick the sanctions. We stop the export of oil. We pressure India to stop buying Russian oil, and of course, we keep arming the Ukrainians. Again, for this guy who considers himself the master of the deal, maximize the leverage of the West so that we can bring this war not just to a conclusion, but to a fair and just conclusion that will keep the Russians from invading countries in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your role on the Intelligence Committee, you get to see things the public does not. With that in mind, the President has designated this Venezuelan gang, Tren de Ar- Aragua, TDA, as a foreign terrorist organization. He says they're invading the country. He's using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members without a day in court. Part of the legal justification of all of this rests on the claim that the Venezuelan government is controlling what TDA is doing. The National Intelligence Council assessed the Maduro government does not control the gang. But, on this program last Sunday, the secretary of state rejected that. He says he favors the FBI's finding, which is that some members of the Venezuelan government do influence the gang. Why does all of this matter?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, it matters Margaret, because I'll remind you that in the George W. Bush administration, exactly what is happening right now happened. It was a different topic. Right now, despite the conclusions of the intelligence community, the president, the Director of National Intelligence and the secretary of state are saying that Venezuela directs Tren De Aragua. Now they're saying that because they need this no due process mechanism of deporting people, the Alien Enemies Act, which, by the way, the courts are now laughing at. But the reason it matters, Margaret, is because the last time the White House did this, when they were determined that the intelligence community be forced to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which there turned out not to be, 4,400 American servicemen perished in a war that was fought on false pretenses, not to mention, by the way, the many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who perished in that war, which was a catastrophic strategic mistake driven by the politicization, the- the notion that George W. Bush had that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. That's why intelligence matters. There's 4,400 families in this country who lost people because the White House decided they would override the conclusion of their $90 billion a year intelligence community. That's what Marco Rubio is doing. That's what the president is doing, and that's what Director Gabbard are doing when they contradict what their own organization is telling them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, this is also becoming an issue for Joe Kent, who is the president's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center. He's under scrutiny because emails show that while acting as chief of staff to DNI Gabbard, he pressed analysts to amend an assessment of links between the government and TDA. According to redacted emails that my network has obtained, he wrote, \"we need to do some rewriting, a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" the president of the United States. He says, \"we need to\u2026incorporate the FBI's assessment.\" You have now read these declassified emails as well. Do you believe that Joe Kent was just asking for more context?",
      "REP. HIMES: No, he absolutely was not. And I have seen the redacted emails. He was pressuring the National Intelligence Council to alter their conclusions. And look, he gave away the game. You just read the line. He told us why he did that, so that this report would not be used against the president or the Director of National Intelligence. Think about that. The chief of staff of the- of the Office of the Director National Intelligence wasn't saying, we need the very best intelligence here. We need you to go back and make sure you're 100% true. He was saying, we need to make sure that your product is not used to embarrass the president and the Director of National Intelligence. That is the very definition, the very definition, of politicizing intelligence. This is not about embarrassing or not embarrassing anybody. Again, back to those 4,400 dead Americans. So no, Joe Kent must never be confirmed for any Senate confirmed- look, it's all out there for the Senate to see. So no, he may- he must never be confirmed for any Senate confirmed position because of what he did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. And those emails are available for the public to read as well. Congressman Himes, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 25, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with the passage of what President Trump is calling his \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" and the man who got it through the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, who joins us from Benton, Louisiana. Good morning to you, Mr. Speaker.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Hey, good morning, and I wish a blessed Memorial Day weekend to everybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed. Well, you got this massive tax and border bill through, just barely, one vote margin. You pulled an all-nighter. Among other things, it will eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. Put about $50 billion towards the border wall and hiring Border Patrol agents, keep in place existing individual tax rates, create savings accounts for kids with a one-time deposit of $1,000, increase the child tax credit by about 500 bucks. The- the bill on this is estimated to be between four and $5 trillion over the next decade. How much do you think this is all going to cost?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, that's about the right estimate. But at the same time, we have historic savings for the American people. Cuts to government to make it more efficient and effective and- and work better for the people. That was a big campaign promise of President Trump and a big promise of ours, and we're going to achieve that. So in the calculation here, there's more than $1.5 trillion in savings, Margaret, for the people. And that's- that's the largest amount- biggest cut in government, really, in at least 30 years and if you adjust for inflation, probably the largest in the history of government. So we're proud of what we produced here. We've checked all the boxes, where all the things that you mentioned in existence- in addition to American energy dominance, investing in our military industrial base, which is appropriate for us to talk about this weekend and so many other priorities and that's why we call it the \"One Big Beautiful Bill. I think arguably, it's the most consequential legislation that Congress will pass in many generations, and it's a long time coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just this morning, we did hear from some of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate, where this heads next, that they can't support the bill as it is written. I think you know this. Senator Rand Paul said the cuts are 'wimpy and anemic,' 'the math doesn't add up,' it will 'explode the debt.' In addition to that political criticism, you've already seen--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: --Yeah, Senator Paul and I are\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Moody's credit rating agency downgrade American credit and Goldman Sachs says that this bill will not offset the damage from the President's tariffs. Isn't this an economic gamble?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No, it's not an economic gamble. It's a big investment. And look, this- what this bill is going to do is be jet fuel to the U.S. economy. It is going to foster a pro growth economy. What do we mean by that? Because we're reducing taxes, we're reducing regulations, we're going to increase and incentivize American manufacturing again. And what will- the effect this will have in the economy is that entrepreneurs and risk takers and job creators will have an easier time in doing that. They will allow for more jobs and more opportunity for more people, and wages will increase. Now, Margaret, this is not a theoretical exercise. We did this already in the first Trump administration. After just the first two years, we brought about the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the U.S. because we did it- followed a very simple formula, we cut taxes and we cut regulations. This time--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't do it in the middle of a tariff war.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: --we're doing that on steroids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the first administration, there was sequencing\u2013",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got tax reform- the Republicans got tax reform through and held off the tariff war. Goldman Sachs says, \"the hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package.\" That's Goldman Sachs.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well- well, I know. I respect Goldman Sachs, but I think what they're discounting here is the growth that will be spurred on by this legislation, and the fact that the so-called tariff war is beginning to subside already. You've got over 75 countries that are negotiating new, more fair trade agreements for the U.S. right now because of the President's insistence that that be done and it was decades overdue. That is going to benefit every American, it's going to benefit the consumers. You know, they howled when the first tariffs- reciprocal tariffs policy was announced, and they said that prices would skyrocket. That simply hasn't happened. Many of those early estimates were far off, and that's being proven now. So what I think will happen is the tariffs, you know, contest will subside. This legislation will pass and get the economy going again and people will feel that. They'll see it in their own pocketbooks, in their own opportunity and every American household is going to benefit by these policies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know Walmart has already said that it will have to raise prices. It's not theoretical. And the President on Friday was talking about even more tariffs, this time on Apple and others. But back- back to your end of the- of the deal here, for this tax relief, you \u00a0talked about the cuts to pay for it all. You are eliminating subsidized federal student loans so the government will no longer cover the interest on debt while borrowers' in school. You're eliminating 500 billion in clean energy subsidies and you're terminating early tax breaks for electric vehicles. Alongside that, you're carrying out about a trillion in reductions to Medicaid and food stamps. We looked at your home state, and the projection is that nearly 200,000 Louisianans will lose their Medicaid coverage because of this. How do you defend that to your constituents?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP. What we're doing, Margaret, is working on fraud, waste and abuse, and everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress. Just in- in Medicaid, for example, you've got 1.4 million illegal aliens receiving those benefits. That is not what Medicaid is intended for. It's intended for vulnerable populations, for young, single, pregnant women and the elderly and the disabled and people who desperately need those resources. Right now, they're being drained by fraud, waste and abuse. You've got about 4.8 million people on Medicaid right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system. If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system. And no one in the country believes that that's right. So there's a- there's a moral component to what we're doing. And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, but in- first of all, just undocumented immigrants, you know, are not eligible for food stamps or Medicaid. Some--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: And yet they're receiving them that's the problem\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --lawfully present immigrants are. So the 190,000 Louisianans that are projected by KFF as losing their Medicaid. Your position is they were just lazy, not working? That they were undocumented? What about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No. What we're talking about again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system. And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all. By the way, the work requirements, Margaret, is not some onerous, burdensome thing. It's a minimum of 20 hours a week. You could either be working or be in a job program, a job training program, or volunteering in your community. This is not some, some onerous thing ,this is common sense. And when the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it. This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of. And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats should agree to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate has been very vocal about his concern in regard to what you're doing to Medicaid. Josh Hawley has been arguing it is 'morally wrong and politically suicidal' to slash health insurance for the working poor. He said the cost sharing language will force people at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit, which means working people will pay more. How do you defend that? Because you know, in the Senate, they are going to make changes to this.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: My friend Josh Hawley is a fiscal conservative as I am. We don't want to slash benefits. And again, I make this very clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. We are not cutting SNAP. We're working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP, for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024 over $11 billion in SNAP payments were- were erroneous. I mean, that's- that's a number that everyone acknowledges is real. It may be much higher than that--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Louisiana is like--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: But here's the problem, the states--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the second largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Let me explain it, Margaret. Let me explain it. The states- the states are not properly administering this because they don't have enough skin in the game. So what we've done in the bill is add some- just a modest state sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud. Why? Again, so that it is preserved for the people that need it the most. This is common sense, Margaret. It's good government, and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Hawley objects to that cost sharing language. He is the one leveraging that criticism. This is going to change, you know that, when it goes to the Senate. How do you- how do you put Republicans up to have to defend these things when they are facing an election in 17 months?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We got almost every vote in the House because we worked on it for more than a year in finding the exact balance of reforms to the program so that we can save them and secure them. I think- I think Senator Hawley will see that when he looks into the details of what we passed on Thursday. This is a big thing, it's an historic thing, once in a generation legislation. We call it the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' because it's going to do so much and the America first agenda will be delivered for the people just as we promised. And look, I had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team. It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this- this ball over the goal line, so to speak. And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well, you- you have five to six Republicans from high tax states who are not going to want to see that change in the state and local tax deductions and there's not a commitment to that in the Senate. Can you still get this through the house without SALT?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Look, we- there's got to be a modification to SALT, and as I've explained to my Senate colleagues many times, you know, they don't have SALT caucus in the Senate because they're all from red states, but in the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents. Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality. We'd love to cut more costs. We'd love to do even more, but we have to deal within the realm of possibility. And I think this is a huge leap forward for fiscal responsibility, for a government that's effective and accountable to the people and real relief for hard working Americans, and they well deserve it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well before I let you go, I want to ask you about another provision that was tucked into this bill. Democrats say it is weakening separation of powers and punishing the courts. It's a specific provision that would restrict a federal court's power to enforce injunctions with contempt, unless there was a bond attached to it. Sounds really weedy, but it's causing a lot of outcry. If this might get stripped out in the Senate anyway, why did you bother to stick it in?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, we bothered to stick it in because that's our responsibility in Congress. It is about separation of powers, and right now you have activist judges, a handful of them around the country, who are abusing that power. They're issuing these nationwide injunctions. They're- they're engaging in political acts from the bench, and that is not what our system is intended for. And people have lost their- their- their faith in our system of justice. We have to restore it and bringing about a simple reform like that is something that I think everybody should applaud.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Cindy McCain, World Food Programme executive director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 25, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme, Cindy McCain. She joins us this morning from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Good morning to you.",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a few hotspots in Africa, but let's start first on the Middle East if we could. In Gaza, we have this man-made catastrophe with Israeli authorities blocking the entry of all aid from March until about May 18. The Trump administration said Israel needs to let in food. So are your deliveries consistently now getting through?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, let's start with the fact that this is a catastrophe, and you're absolutely correct, and I'm very grateful that you are covering this issue. They have let a few trucks in. This is a drop in the bucket as to what's needed. Right now, we have 500,000 people inside of Gaza that are- that are extremely food insecure, and could be on the verge of famine if we don't help bring them back from that. We need to get in, and we need to get in at scale, not just a few dribble of the trucks right now, as I said, it's a drop in the bucket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how many trucks need to be getting in daily to address the scale of the need you see, and can they get into northern Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, prior to the, you know, during the cease-fire, I should say, we were getting in 600 trucks a day. Right now, we're getting in maybe 100 something like that. So it's not nearly enough, and it needs to be going to the correct places. So the various gates, it's inconsistent as to how the gates are open. It's inconsistent as to the roads we can use. The roads that are the better roads, the ones that can get us further along, aren't open at all. It's complicated right now and again, I will tell anybody who will listen, we need to get in and get in at scale and be allowed to feed these people before further catastrophe occurs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your organization announced at least 15 of your trucks were looted when they entered southern Gaza en route to bakeries. Israel has consistently said that the looting is being carried out by Hamas. Have you seen evidence that it is Hamas stealing the food?",
      "MCCAIN: No, not at all. Not- not in this round. Listen, these people are desperate, and they see a World Food Programme truck coming in, and they run for it. This- this doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime, or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death, and so we will continue to go in. We will continue to go in with food and the kinds of supplies we need to help the bakeries operate and make sure that we can continue to do that, and hopefully be able to do more of it. But again, we can't do this unless the world community puts pressure on this. We can't be allowed to sit back and watch these people starve to death with no outside diplomatic influence to help us. These- these- these poor souls are really, really, really desperate. And you know, having been in- in a food riot myself some years ago, I understand the desperation very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, five days ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take control of all of Gaza, which seems to be a shift from going in, carrying out raids and then withdrawing. We've seen the Pope speak out. We've seen the leaders of France, of Canada, of the U.K. calling the cutting of aid egregious. Netanyahu said criticism like that is feeding Hamas and really feeding anti-semitism. What do you make of that pushback from him, that criticisms of the state are feeding hate?",
      "MCCAIN: What I do know is you're not feeding people and the most important part of this is that's what we're supposed to be doing. I'm very grateful for anyone, the Pope, any of the folks that did, did shout out and say, listen, we need to get more in, but I can't tell you as to what exactly what Netanyahu is thinking or anything else. What I do know for a fact is that we need food to get into Gaza to avoid an utter catastrophe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli army had announced aid will be distributed under what they described as an American plan. Prime Minister Netanyahu said it will be American companies giving food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. There's reporting in the Washington Post that these are armed private contractors doing logistics, Palestinians will have to submit to identity checks to be fed, and that would replace the U.N. coordinated networks, presumably also the World Food Programme. Do you know how much longer you will be allowed to operate in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: I've not seen a plan from anybody. We continue to operate, doing what we do best, and we are the largest and the best at what we do, I might add. I- we've never been- a plan has ever been proposed to us. We really don't know what's coming around the bend. We will continue to operate. We will work with anybody, if it will feed people. That's the most important part here is that we can't turf off on things we will, we need to work together. We need to be able to feed these people and be able to get in consistently and at scale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We haven't heard in- in the press, at least, from the administration any of the details either, but we do know that the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, announced back on May 9, that this is going to be a U.S. initiative involving only Israeli security. The Israelis are not distributing food. Secretary Rubio was just in Rome. He said he did meet with you. Did you share with him any of your concerns?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, we had a very frank discussion about exactly what was going on and what we could do to help alleviate a lot of this. Some of it- I'm not sure that they were completely clear on how we operate and the size that we are and the logistics ability that we have to be able to do this. So- so we had a very nice discussion. As you know, the Rubio family and the McCain family have been friends for a very long time. And so I was grateful that he would take the time to listen to what- what we had to say, and let us discuss exactly how we feel we should be able to operate. And I was very grateful for and for and honored to have the opportunity to speak to him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he assure you that the U.S. supports the U.N. and the World Food Programme continuing to supply food in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: We didn't really discuss the U.S. participation in any of this. He was really, really concerned with and really trying to understand how we operate and- and the need for what exactly what we do. Again, I will tell you, we will- we will work with anybody, as long as it feeds people and feeds people safely, I might add, on the ground, and keeps our people and people from other agencies safe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're speaking to us now from the Congo. President Trump claimed this past week, the administration was close to brokering a deal between the Congo and Rwanda to end their war. The numbers are staggering in terms of food insecurity. Do you have any sense that there is some kind of cease-fire that you're close to that could help feed people?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I'm hearing that there are some possible discussions going to take place in Qatar, some other discussions that have taken place in other countries and certainly other regions of Africa. What I do know is we need to hurry up. People are hungry and people have been displaced, and people- disease outbreaks are becoming more prevalent now because of some of the flooding as a result of the weather, the weather issues here. So my my purpose in this particular trip, I've been here many, many times, and my purpose in this particular trip is to see just exactly where we sit, exactly what kind of kind of foods are being allowed in number one and number two, what we can do better to help alleviate some of the, the, these, the issues that are going on here with regards to food. There's a large amount of people within DRC, Congo, particularly in the east, that don't have access to food, and if they do, it's not very much. So it's- it's my- my time right now is to make sure that we're doing the very best we can to make sure people don't go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've spoken in the past about just how horrific the conditions are inside Sudan right now. This past week, the Trump administration put further restrictions on the government after it used chemical weapons against its own people, something they said happened in 2024. There's also a famine there right now. Is there any sign that you will be able to get in and feed people there?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, we're in there right now. We're in there and you know, it's complicated to be able to, to be in there, but we're in there, we are feeding. But again, there is famine and being- being able to be able to feed, to travel freely, to distribute food, and to get into the places we need to go, is the issue here. And as you know, there's many factions that play on the ground in Sudan.",

      "The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely \"lacked any semblance of due process.\"",
      "Mexico has since returned him to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, according to court documents. An earlier court proceeding determined that the man, identified by the initials O.C.G., risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the U.S.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to dispatch hundreds of border agents to different parts of the country so they can help Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest unauthorized immigrants in the U.S interior, three sources familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The plan would be the latest escalation in the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to muster the vast resources and personnel of agencies across the federal government to support ICE in its bid to carry out what the president has vowed will be the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "The effort is expected to involve around 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in charge of interdicting the illicit entry of migrants and drugs, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal governments plans that have not been announced.",
      "The sources said the CBP teams would also include members of the agency's Office of Field Operations, which oversees legal entry points into the U.S., and Air and Marine Operations, a specialized law enforcement unit with maritime and aerial assets.",
      "CBP agents and officers assigned to the effort are expected to assist their counterparts in ICE's 25 field offices by supporting immigration enforcement operations targeting immigrants in the country illegally, the sources added.",
      "The effort could start as early as next week, two of the sources said.",
      "As immigration officers, CBP personnel have the legal authority to arrest and process immigrants who are suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Historically, however, CBP's work has been mainly limited to the Mexican and Canadian borders, maritime sectors and international airports.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/noaa-hurricane-season-forecast-2025/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 20:12:56 -0400",
    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters announced their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

      "Divine Right",
      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",

      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",

Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\"Providing some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, most states have not.\"",

      "A man believed to be on drugs was shot and killed Monday by Florida sheriff's deputies who had tried to shock him with a Taser as he wielded a set of garden shears shortly after he was apparently bitten by an alligator in a lake, a sheriff said.",
      "Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told reporters the two deputies were trying to de-escalate the situation before the man, identified as 42-year-old Timothy Schulz, climbed into their running patrol vehicle and tried to get the weapons inside. That's when the deputies opened fire, Judd said.",
      "\"This is just crazy stuff, OK?\" Judd said. \"You know that it's got to be true, you can't make it up.\"",
      "Schulz had a long history of drug-related arrests, Judd said. He had been released from jail last Tuesday after being arrested for possession of meth, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Monday's incident started when a convenience store worker at about 5:56 a.m. reported a man acting bizarrely, shaking and asking to call his son, Judd said. Deputies went to the store but couldn't find the man.",
      "At about 7:43 a.m., people reported a man later identified as Schulz swimming in a lake that contained multiple alligators, Judd said. One witness tried to give him a life preserver, and another tried to speak with him but received a growl in response, according to the sheriff.",
      "While Schulz was in the lake, he was apparently bitten by an alligator on his right arm, Judd said.",
      "\"The fact that he was bitten by an alligator, significantly, and still continued his rampage is shocking,\" Judd said. \"But if you're on enough meth, then the person you see is not the person that's attacking.\"",
      "When Schulz emerged from the water in a gated community in Lakeland, east of Tampa, he picked up a set of garden shears that had been left outside, Judd said. Schulz then tried to break into a vehicle with a brick.",
      "After deputies arrived at the scene, Schulz charged at them with the shears, Judd said. The deputies tried to de-escalate the situation, told Schulz to put the shears down and attempted to shock him with a Taser twice, according to the sheriff.",
      "\"They were still trying to take him peacefully into custody,\" Judd said.",
      "Schulz entered the deputies' still-running patrol vehicle from the passenger side and tried to get either the rifle or the shotgun inside from their holders, Judd said. The deputies then shot Schulz multiple times.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 07:33:28 -0400",
    "summary": "As the Trump administration moves to limit COVID booster vaccines for some, here's what to know about the latest variant NB.1.8.1 and its symptoms.",
    "story": [
      "Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a large surge in China, have\u00a0been detected in multiple locations across the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The earliest cases in the U.S. date back to late March and early April, and were detected through a screening program at airports for arriving international travelers.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement last week.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "But hospitalizations abroad have raised questions about the new variant, its symptoms and more. Here's what to know, according to experts.",
      "New COVID variant's symptoms",
      "NB.1.8.1 is associated with symptoms that are \"broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains of the virus,\" Subhash Verma, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "Commonly reported symptoms include respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic effects like fever and fatigue, he said.",
      "How dangerous is the new COVID variant?",
      "\"Data indicates that NB.1.8.1 does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, although it appears to have a growth advantage, suggesting it may spread more easily,\" Verma said. \"In other words, it is more transmissible.\"",
      "Authorities in Hong Kong\u00a0say\u00a0there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe than previous strains.",
      "Dr. Amy Edwards, assistant professor of pediatrics at the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University who specializes in infectious diseases, also told CBS News there is some evidence in the lab that this variant binds more tightly to human cells, which means it is easier to transmit. But, that doesn't mean it leads to more severe infection.",
      "\"What they're seeing in China, Hong Kong and some other areas where this variant has really surged, is an increase in hospitalization, but that seems to be more to do with just a standard summer surge that we've been seeing,\" Edwards explained, adding the available data is still preliminary, but that the variant \"doesn't seem to be more severe.\"",
      "2025 COVID booster shot",
      "Despite the latest variant displaying high transmissibility, the Trump administration is planning to limit booster vaccine access to some groups.",
      "Last week, the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u00a0said it will continue approving\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine\u00a0updates for seniors and those with an\u00a0underlying medical condition, including pregnancy or diabetes, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "Verma said these restrictions could have several significant public health impacts.",
      "\"Although over 100 million Americans are still expected to qualify under these criteria, the administration's decision introduces new barriers for the broader population,\" he said. \"One immediate concern is that the FDA's requirement for updated clinical trials could delay access to boosters for lower-risk groups, discouraging some individuals from seeking vaccination. The new policy may also create confusion and reduce vaccination rates if people are uncertain about their eligibility or worried about insurance coverage, particularly with high-cost manufacturers planning to charge.\"",
      "Edwards said the recommendation updates remain unclear.",
      "\"Some of the language around pre-existing conditions is pretty loose,\" she explained. \"The other thing is, it's not clear what variants are going to be in this year's vaccine, especially with some question around what kind of vaccine trials are going to be allowed.\"",
      "The new COVID-19 vaccination framework was laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has publicly raised doubts about vaccines.",
      "\"We had heard Secretary Kennedy say, we're not going to take away your vaccines, we're going to be super transparent. And in fact, what is happening is people are going to lose access to vaccines,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\" following the FDA's announcement about vaccine approvals.",
      "Are there other ways to prevent infection?",
      "With questions about vaccine access up in the air, Edwards said there are still strategies for prevention.",
      "\"Good cough and sneezing hygiene, good hand washing, staying home if you're not feeling well to keep other people from catching what you've got,\" Edwards advised. \"If you're a little under the weather, but well enough to be out and about, wearing a mask.\"",
      "Despite some controversy around mask wearing, Edwards said they can prevent spread by keeping your germs to yourself.",
      "\"One of the places where masks have long been known to be the most effective is in preventing someone who's ill from passing that infection to other people,\" she said. \"So if I've got a slight sore throat, little bit of sniffles, obviously, that might not be enough to keep me home, but if I put a mask on, I can reduce the risk that I would transmit whatever I'm carrying to other people. And that's not just for COVID. That's any respiratory virus.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-rate-funtionally-unemployed-economy/",
    "published": "Mon, 26 May 2025 15:53:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Many workers aren't working as much as they'd like. Here's what one expert says the federal unemployment rate fails to capture.",
    "story": [
      "While the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, another measure of worker well-being indicates there may be bigger cracks in the labor market.",
      "The low unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in April, has signaled to economists and investors alike that the U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Employers are also continuing to hire despite headwinds like tariffs and plunging consumer confidence.",
      "But another indicator suggests those pieces of government data may be painting an overly rosy picture of the economy, with a recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finding the \"true rate\" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, up slightly from 24% in March, while the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate remained unchanged at 4.2% over the same period.",
      "LISEP's measure encompasses not only unemployed workers, but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. By tracking functionally unemployed workers, the measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion.",
      "\"The unemployment data, as it's put out, has some flaws,\" LISEP chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"For example, it counts you as employed if you've worked as little as one hour over the prior two weeks. So you can be homeless and in a tent community and have worked one hour and be counted, irrespective of how poorly-paid that hour may be.\"",
      "LISEP, in a working paper on the gauge, says the measure prevents part-time jobs or poorly paid work from being counted as equal to full-time and better-paid work. LISEP also argues that the unemployment rate \"presents a very incomplete and, in many ways, misleading picture.\"",
      "In other words, people who lack steady work and don't earn living wages shouldn't be counted as functionally employed. Its True Rate of Unemployment (TRU), which began tracking the measure in 2020, encapsulates workers whose earnings don't allow them to make ends meet, and are struggling just to get by, according to LISEP.",
      "\"If you're part time and can't get a full-time job, then we count you as functionally unemployed,\" Ludwig noted. \"We also count as functionally unemployed people who don't earn above a poverty wage.\"",
      "\"Survival mode\"",
      "In so doing, it counts workers who can't afford to put roofs over their heads, can't procure nuturious meals and don't have the ability to save as being functionally unemployed.",
      "\"You don't have anything that gets you to the first rung of the American dream ladder. You're in survival mode,\" Ludwig said.",
      "When broken down by race and gender, TRU shows Hispanic, Black and women workers faring worse than White workers, as well as men.",
      "More than 28% of Hispanic workers, and nearly 27% of Black workers are functionally unemployed, compared to 23% of White workers. And more female workers \u2014 28.6% \u2014 are functionally unemployed than male workers, whose true rate of unemployment stands at 20%, according to LISEP.",
      "Millions of households are currently struggling to maintain a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to another recent analysis from LISEP.",
      "Its research found that the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living. These households earned an average of $38,000 per year in 2023, but would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "The wide chasm between the the BLS's measure of unemployment and its true rate of unemployment is also concerning, according to Ludwig.",
      "\"If you say there's 4.2% unemployment, which makes political folks happy because it's a low number, it causes all kinds of poor policy decisions and assumes we are better off than we are,\" Ludwig said. \"There's less energy and less of a push to improve employment, and the people who get hurt are middle- and low-income Americans.\"",

    "summary": "Authorities in Hong Kong say COVID-19 levels are the worst in at least a year.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",

      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

    "summary": "A study published in JAMA Network Open\u200b analyzed the nutritional value of cereals marketed to children between 2010 and 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Breakfast cereal is often appealing for being easy, kid friendly \u2014 and sweet. But a recent study found that children's breakfast cereals have been getting sweeter, fattier and less nutritious.",
      "In a study published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, researchers from the University of Kentucky and Louisiana State University say they analyzed the nutritional value of cereals between 2010 and 2023 \u2014 specifically those marketed toward\u00a0children aged 5 to 12.",
      "In those 13 years, 1,200 cereals were launched, which includes new products, new formulations and new packaging. The researchers found that during that time, the total fat per serving increased 33.6% on average in the cereal brands.",
      "Sodium content increased 32.1% \u2014 from 156.0 mg to 206.1 mg. The recommended daily serving of sodium for kids aged 5 to 8 is less than 1,500 mg and for kids aged 9 to 13, it is less than 1,800 mg,\u00a0according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Total carbohydrates remained relatively stable \u2014 with the average of 27.32 g in 2010 and 28.45 g in 2023. Sugar content increased by 10.9%.",
      "Protein and dietary fiber \u2014 two necessary nutrients \u2014 decreased. While protein fluctuated between 2010 and 2020, with an average 1.97 g per serving, it decreased in 2023 to 1.69 g per serving. And dietary fiber was also steady until it showed a decrease from 2021 to 2023: 3.82 g to 2.84 g per serving.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Shuoli Zhao, an assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at University of Kentucky and co-author of the study, told CBS News breakfast is a critical meal for kids and impacts their energy and concentration for their learning throughout the day.",
      "\"If a common breakfast choice like cereal is trending towards lower nutritional quality in its newest iterations, as our study suggests, it potentially makes it harder for parents to ensure their children are getting a healthy start to the day,\" Zhao said. \"I also feel these findings contribute to the broader discussion about the overall 'food environment' that children are exposed to, as often times, working families may have limited 'bandwidth' and time on grocery shopping, which leads to unintended suboptimal decisions in food choices.\"",
      "Zhao said what is available at the supermarket shelves is important, and he hopes the research sparks a conversation on how food industry stakeholders can create healthier options for kids.",
      "Zhao declined to share which brands were studied and which showed the biggest decrease in nutritional value. The study used data from a database on food and beverage launches managed by Mintel, a market intelligence and research agency.",
      "A 2014 study found that some cereals can be a part of a nutritious diet. Those that are whole grain or high in fiber can be important sources of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, according to the study published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "However, while these cereals could even be the most important sources of whole grains in one's diet, they could also contain salt, sugar and saturated fat, raising uncertainty about their nutritional benefits, the researchers say.",
      "A 2023 study published by NIH found that those who ate cereal for breakfast had a better nutritional intake and diet quality. The researchers say 28% of children and 12% of adults are ready-to-eat breakfast consumers.",

      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 A 19-year-old New Zealand man has died after taking part in a new tackling game that's trending on social media  in which competitors run at each other and collide while wearing no protective equipment. Police confirmed Ryan Satterthwaite suffered a head injury on Sunday while playing a backyard game with friends in the North Island city of Palmerston North. He died on Monday as a result of his injuries.",
      "Area police commander Inspector Ross Grantham described Satterthwaite's death as \"a huge tragedy\" and urged others to \"consider the significant safety and injury risks\" of the game that is known as RUNIT or RUNIT Straight.",
      "\"A young man lost his life as a result of participating in what I understand to be a social media frenzy,\" Grantham said. \"While this is not a criminal matter, police will continue to undertake inquiries on behalf of the coroner.\"",
      "Grantham said \"the tackle game played by the group of friends was based on a social media-driven trend where participants compete in full-contact collisions without protective gear.",
      "\"While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity.\"",
      "RUNIT is based loosely on the contact elements of rugby union, rugby league or the NFL and involves two competitors, a runner and a tackler, running at each other and colliding on a 65 foot by 13 foot area known as a battlefield.",
      "The game has grown in social media popularity through the Australian RUNIT Championship League, which offers cash prizes to competitors. Organizers promote the event as \"the world's fiercest new collision sport.\"",
      "Two trial events in Auckland in recent weeks saw eight men compete for 20,000 New Zealand dollars ($12,000) in front of more than 1,000 spectators. Winners were expected to go into a championship event next month with prize money of up to 250,000 New Zealand dollars ($150,000).",
      "Two other events in Auckland were canceled when organizers were unable to obtain permits.",
      "The RUNIT Championship League released a statement to the New Zealand news website Stuff on Tuesday, saying it \"does not encourage any copying of the sport as it should only be done under the strict conditions.\"",
      "\"This is tragic news and our hearts go out to the family and friends of Ryan. Any contact sport like boxing, martial arts or combat-style activities should only be held in highly controlled environments which include professional medical supervision and support.\"",
      "RUNIT has been strongly condemned by experts in head injuries who say competitors run a high risk of a serious brain injury.",
      "It is by no means the first social media-fueled trend to draw safety warnings after a tragedy. Medical experts have been forced to warn people, and young people in particular, about the risks of everything from inhaling solvents to abusing over-the-counter medications and even snorting condoms.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles II will address Canada's Parliament on Tuesday, a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with tariffs and annexation threats by President Trump.",
      "The British monarch, who formally serves as Canada's head of state, arrived in the capital of Ottawa on Monday, part of a two-day visit that's widely viewed as a form of pushback against Mr. Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Why is King Charles speaking to Canada's parliament?",
      "The king is delivering a \"Speech from the Throne,\" which marks the start of a new session of Parliament after the center-left Liberal Party won last month's federal election. The speech \u2014 written by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office, not the king \u2014 will lay out the new government's agenda and priorities.",
      "Marking the start of Parliament with a speech is a longstanding tradition in Canada and other former parts of the British Empire \u2014 but it's highly unusual for the king to deliver the speech himself. Instead, the king's representative in Canada, the governor-general, normally speaks on his behalf. The last time the monarch personally gave the speech was in 1977, when Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0traveled to Canada's capital for the event.",
      "The speech will take place at 11 a.m. EDT on Tuesday.",
      "Is King Charles' visit to Ottawa related to Trump?",
      "Some watchers of Canadian politics think so, especially as Mr. Trump has repeatedly mused about the United States annexing Canada, stirring strong backlash.",
      "Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta, says the royal visit could be \"an indication that the king takes Canada's sovereignty seriously.\"",
      "\"The explicit threats to Canada's sovereignty probably got the attention of the king and his advisers,\" Wesley told CBS News.",
      "The visit could also play to domestic politics, Wesley says. Mr. Trump's comments have \"stirred up patriotism in some odd corners of Canada,\" and the country's status as a constitutional monarchy where the king is still technically the head of state is one major difference between Canada and its neighbor to the south. And even though most Canadians are fairly indifferent toward the monarchy, visits by royals always draw interest.",
      "\"It's seen as a point of pride and distinction between Canada and the U.S.,\" said Wesley, who previously served in several roles for Alberta's provincial government.",
      "University of Toronto political science professor Elizabeth McCallion said the visit is likely intended as a \"reminder that we are an independent country\" and a \"rallying together of Canadians.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Carney told Sky News the invitation to Charles was \"not coincidental.\" In a statement welcoming Charles on Monday, the prime minister didn't mention Mr. Trump, but did hint at Canada's \"distinct identity\" and \"historic ties that crises only fortify.\"",
      "Charles also has a longstanding relationship with Canada, visiting the country over a dozen times before ascending to the throne. Amid a rocky relationship with the United States, many Canadians have looked for signs of support from Charles, taking note of symbolic gestures like the crown's decision to plant a maple tree at Buckingham Palace earlier this year, McCallion said.",
      "McCallion says some Canadians also believe Mr. Trump's longstanding fascination with the British royal family could play to the country's benefit.",
      "\"There's hope that when he's visiting, Trump will take notice and respect the fact that Canada has connections to the British monarchy,\" McCallion told CBS News.",
      "Charles is the head of state for both Canada and the U.K., putting him in an unusual position as the U.K. seeks a stronger trade relationship with the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Carney criticized the U.K. government for inviting Mr. Trump to a state visit earlier this year, presenting Mr. Trump with an invitation from the king. The Canadian leader told Sky News most Canadians \"weren't impressed by that gesture.\"",
      "What could King Charles say in the speech \u2014 and will he mention Trump?",
      "McCallion thinks the speech to Parliament is unlikely to name Mr. Trump overtly \u2014 but it could mention Canada's sovereignty. \"Everybody knows what it means in this context,\" she said.",
      "The speech could have more explicit references to the U.S.-Canada trade relationship, though, as Mr. Trump threatens steep tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "\"I'm not saying that there should be a drinking game attached to it, but if there were \u2026 I think every time you heard the term 'reset' in relation to the relationship between Canada and the United States, [that] would be deserving of a drink,\" Wesley said.",
      "The speech could also reference other parts of Carney's agenda, with nods to his promise to make Canada an \"energy superpower\" and his plans around affordability, Wesley notes.",
      "Also worth watching: After the speech, Parliament will hold a debate and an up-or-down vote on the government's agenda. If the vote fails, another federal election could be necessary \u2014 but both McCallion and Wesley said that's highly unlikely.",
      "What has Trump said about Canada \u2014 and how has Carney responded?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated annexing Canada in recent months, rattling Canadian politics.",
      "The 51st-state jabs sometimes appear tongue-in-cheek: Mr. Trump referred to Carney's predecessor \u2014 who stepped down as prime minister ahead of new elections this year \u2014 as \"Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.\" In other cases, Mr. Trump has cast absorbing Canada as a tidy way of resolving the U.S.'s trade deficit with its northern neighbor.",
      "But Trudeau has reportedly called Mr. Trump's talk of absorbing Canada \"a real thing,\" telling business and labor leaders in a private meeting that he sees taking over Canada as a way of getting access to the country's mineral wealth, according to the public broadcaster CBC. Many Canadian voters hold the same view, according to McCallion.",
      "\"I think maybe the first or second time, people were offended but thought he was kidding. And at this point, certainly no Canadians think he's kidding,\" McCallion said. \"Most Canadians are taking it as a serious threat.\"",
      "When asked whether he would use military force to take over Canada, Mr. Trump said earlier this month, \"I don't see it.\" But in a White House meeting with Carney days later, the U.S. leader still called the idea of annexing Canada a \"wonderful marriage\" that would deliver \"tremendous\" benefits to Canada, and referred to the border between the two countries as \"artificial.\"",
      "Carney said in the meeting Canada \"won't be for sale, ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on many Canadian goods, leading Canada to hit the U.S. with retaliatory levies.",
      "Last month's Canadian elections were dominated by Mr. Trump's tariffs and annexation comments, and the race was widely seen as a referendum on who Canadians trusted more to deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Carney's Liberal Party \u2014 which has held power for almost a decade \u2014 previously trailed the Conservatives in polling, but its fortunes rebounded after Mr. Trump's jabs at Canada. In a victory speech, Carney said the country's \"old relationship with the United States \u2026 is over,\" and argued Mr. Trump is \"trying to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "\"Our national identity is at times muddied because it's made up of so many different cultures that have come together,\" McCallion told CBS News. \"Often, Canadians primarily express their national identity as not being American.\"",

      "Joseph Neumayer, who was born in Colorado and has\u00a0U.S. and German citizenship, was taken into custody at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City by FBI special agents after he was deported from Israel.",
      "According to the prosecutors, Neumayer traveled to Israel in April. On May 19, he arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv carrying a backpack. Without provocation, Neumayer allegedly spat at an embassy guard as he walked by and was able to flee as the guard attempted to detain him. He left his backpack outside the embassy after the tussle.",

    "summary": "Israeli strikes kill dozens in the Gaza Strip, including one on a school-turned-shelter, as controversy and concern mount over getting humanitarian aid into the enclave.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli strikes killed at least 52 people in the Gaza Strip on Monday, including some 36 in a school-turned-shelter that was struck as people slept, igniting their belongings, according to local health officials. The military said it targeted militants operating from the school.",
      "Israel renewed its offensive in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas. It has vowed to seize control of Gaza and keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed or disarmed, and until it returns the remaining 58 hostages, a third of them believed to be alive, from the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.",
      "The strike on the school in the Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City also wounded more than 55 people, said Fahmy Awad, head of the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry's emergency service. He said a father and his five children were among the dead. He said the school was hit three times while people slept, setting their belongings ablaze.",
      "The Israeli military said it had targeted a militant command and control center inside the school that Hamas and Islamic Jihad used to gather intelligence for attacks. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in residential areas, adding that \"numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "Israel says it plans to seize full control of Gaza and facilitate what it describes as the voluntary migration of its over 2 million inhabitants, a plan that has been rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community.",
      "Israel's military campaign has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and internally displaced some 90% of its population. Many have fled multiple times.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the 2023 terrorist attack. More than half the hostages have been returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals, eight have been rescued, and Israeli forces have recovered the remains of dozens more.",
      "The offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, rendering entire neighborhoods uninhabitable. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to shelter in schools and squalid tent camps for well over a year.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed around 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. It says more than half the dead are women and children but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.",
      "Growing concern over food shortages in Gaza",
      "Israel began allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza last week after blocking all food, medicine, fuel or other goods from entering for 2-1/2 months. But aid groups say the supplies that have come in are nowhere near enough to meet the mounting needs of the enclave's residents.",
      "U.N. World Food Program Executive Director Cindy McCain said Sunday on the CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the number of aid trucks allowed to enter Gaza last week was only a \"drop in the bucket\" compared to what's needed to stave off potential famine in the Palestinian territory.",
      "A new aid system, supported by Israel and the United States but rejected by U.N. agencies and other aid groups, is expected to begin operations as soon as Monday, despite the resignation of the American who was supposed to lead the effort, who said it would not be able to operate independently.",
      "Israel plans to roll out the new aid distribution system, run by a group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and made up of former humanitarian, government and military officials, to set up distribution points guarded by private security firms. Israel has long accused Hamas of siphoning off aid supplies brought into Gaza, without providing evidence.",
      "The foundation said in a statement that it would begin delivering aid Monday and would reach a million Palestinians \u2014 around half of Gaza's population \u2014 by the end of the week.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the planned U.S.-backed system, saying it would force even more displacement, fail to meet local needs and violate humanitarian principles that prohibit a warring party from controlling humanitarian assistance. They also say there is no evidence of systematic diversion of aid by Hamas or other armed groups.",
      "Jake Wood, the American heading the foundation, unexpectedly resigned Sunday, saying it had become clear that the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. It's not clear who is funding the group. The foundation said in a statement Monday that it would \"not be deterred\" by Wood's resignation and would begin its delivery as planned.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 May 2025 19:24:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Ukraine says Russia launched its biggest drone strike to date after Trump called Putin crazy for stepping up his offensive and \"needlessly killing a lot of people.\"",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv, Ukraine\u00a0\u2014 Russia launched its biggest drone attack on Ukraine overnight since the more than three-year war began, a Ukrainian official said Monday. President Trump said Russian leader Vladimir Putin had gone \"absolutely crazy\" in stepping up his country's bombing of Ukraine just as the U.S. tries to broker a peace agreement.",
      "Russia's Sunday night attack included the launch of 355 drones, Yuriy Ihnat, head of the Ukrainian air force's communications department, told The Associated Press. The previous night, Russia fired 298 drones and 69 missiles of various types in what Ukrainian authorities said was the largest combined aerial assault during the conflict. Overall, from Friday to Sunday, Russia launched around 900 drones at Ukraine, officials said.",
      "The escalation appeared to thwart hopes that Mr. Trump's peace efforts might lead to a breakthrough in the near term, as Putin looks determined to capture more Ukrainian territory and inflict more damage.",
      "Russia has this month broken its record for aerial bombardments of Ukraine three times. The expansion of its air campaign came after Kyiv in March accepted an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S., but Moscow effectively rejected it. Russia is also still pushing along the roughly 620-mile front line, where it has made slow and costly progress, and is assembling its forces for a summer offensive, Ukraine and military analysts say.",
      "Mr. Trump made it clear he is losing patience with Putin.",
      "\"I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!\" the U.S. president wrote Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Putin is \"needlessly killing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said, pointing out that \"missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever.\"",
      "He warned that if Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine, it will \"lead to the downfall of Russia!\"",
      "But Mr. Trump again expressed frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, too, saying that he's, \"doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does.\"",
      "Zelenskyy reacted to the overnight Russian strikes in his own social media post on Monday, saying: \"Only a sense of complete impunity can allow Russia to carry out such attacks and continually escalate their scale. ... There is no significant military logic to this, but there is considerable political meaning.\"",
      "He repeated his call for tighter international economic sanctions on Russia as a way of ending the war, because Russia's \"desire to fight must be deprived of resources.\"",
      "Russia and Europe react to Trump's remarks on Putin",
      "The Russian government appeared to downplay Mr. Trump's remarks about Putin as an emotional outburst, however some European leaders, who have been frustrated for months by the U.S. president repeating Kremlin talking points about the war and ridiculing Zelenskyy's government, seemed to take some hope by the change in tack.",
      "At the Kremlin, Putin's chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that, \"the start of the negotiation process [with Ukraine], for which the American side has done a lot, is a very important achievement. We are very thankful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for assistance in organizing and launching this negotiation process. This is a very important achievement. \u2026 Of course, at the same time this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone, absolutely, and with emotional reactions. We follow this very closely.\"",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, however, told reporters during a visit to Vietnam that it seemed Mr. Trump appeared to be realizing that Putin had \"lied\" to him about wanting to find a diplomatic resolution to the war. The French leader said his hope was that Mr. Trump's anger at Moscow \"translates into action,\" and he called for Ukraine's international partners to set a firm deadline for Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, with the threat of \"massive sanctions\" should Putin continue to refuse.",
      "Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, meanwhile, told his country's broadcaster WDR that \"Putin obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,\" stressing the Kremlin's rejection of proposed direct talks with Ukraine at the Vatican as evidence that \"we must be prepared for this war to last longer than we all wish or can imagine.\"",
      "Merz said several of Ukraine's partners had already dropped restrictions on allowing their military aid to be used for strikes deep inside Russia.",
      "\"There are no longer any range restrictions on the weapons delivered to Ukraine. Not from the British, nor the French, nor from us \u2026 and not from the Americans either,\" Merz said Monday. \"This means Ukraine can now also defend itself by attacking military targets in Russia. For a long time, it couldn't do that, and with a few exceptions, it didn't. We call this long-range fire, meaning equipping Ukraine in such a way that it can also strike military targets in the hinterland \u2014 and that is the decisive, qualitative difference in Ukraine's warfare: Russia is attacking civilian cities without any regard, bombing cities, hospitals, and nursing homes. Ukraine does not do that.\"",
      "The European Union's top diplomat, foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, earlier described the latest attacks on Kyiv as \"totally appalling\" and said the bloc intended to impose more sanctions on Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened massive sanctions on Moscow, too, but so far hasn't taken action.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin makes decisions that are necessary to ensure Russia's security and that the attacks were Moscow's response to deep strikes by Ukraine.",
      "Prisoner swap provides a solitary sign of progress",
      "Russia and Ukraine swapped hundreds more prisoners Sunday in the third and last part of a major exchange that was a rare moment of cooperation between the warring nations.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said each side exchanged 303 soldiers, following the release of 307 combatants and civilians each on Saturday, and 390 on Friday \u2014 the biggest total swap of the war.",
      "In their talks held in Istanbul earlier this month, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees each. The exchange has been the only tangible outcome of those direct talks to date.",

A 53-year-old White British man from the Liverpool area was arrested shortly after the incident, according to Assistant Chief Constable Jennifer Sims.",

      "Mr. Trump's repeated suggestion that the U.S.\u00a0annex Canada\u00a0prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government's agenda for the new Parliament.",
      "The king is the\u00a0head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\"This historic honor matches the weight of our times. It speaks to our enduring tradition and friendship, to the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify,\" Carney said in a statement.",
      "\"Canada's strength lies in building a strong future while embracing its English, French, and Indigenous roots \u2014 the union of peoples that forms our bedrock.\"",
      "King Charles in Ottawa",
      "His plane landed and Carney, the new prime minister and a former head of the Bank of England, and Canada's first indigenous governor general, Mary Simon, the king's representative in Canada, gathered to greet the king and Queen Camilla as well a 25-member honor guard from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, for which the king is colonel-in-chief.",

      "\"Their visit invites us to reflect on who we are and to celebrate our distinct national identity.\"",
      "Charles' visit comes after Trump's meeting with Carney",
      "Earlier this month, Prime Minister Carney told Mr. Trump that\u00a0Canada is \"not for sale\" and \"won't be for sale, ever\" in an Oval Office meeting, moments after the American president called the border between the U.S. and Canada \"artificial\" and romanticized the idea of Canada joining the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Carney wouldn't be discussing the U.S. acquiring Canada unless \"somebody wants to discuss it,\" but said there would be \"tremendous\" benefits to Canada in the event of a \"wonderful marriage\" between the two countries.",
      "The president has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring Canada, despite Canada's repeated rejection of the concept. Their meeting at the White House was the first one the two leaders have had since Carney's Liberal Party was victorious in\u00a0last month's federal election.",
      "\"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,\" Carney told Mr. Trump. \"We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.\"",
      "Canadians stress their differences from the U.S.",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what's called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign, the last time in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the United States. The king's visit clearly underscores Canada's sovereignty, he said.",
      "After America gained independence from Britain, Canada remained a colony until 1867 and afterward, continued as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\"We are different,\" former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \"If you look at why King Charles is reading the speech from the throne, then you have to then acknowledge Canada's story.\"",
      "However, the new U.S. ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, said sending messages isn't necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there's a message to be sent there's easier ways to do that, such as calling him or calling the president.",
      "Royal historian Carolyn Harris expects Mr. Trump to notice the visit because he has repeatedly spoken about his admiration for the royal family. Mr. Trump might see how different Canada is from the U.S.",
      "\"It is a very distinctive history that goes back to the waves of loyalists who settled here after the American revolution,\" Harris said. \"And we're going to seeing the king in a Canadian context, escorted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, surrounded by Canadian symbolism. This is very much King Charles III in his role as King of Canada.\"",
      "A royal invitation to Trump ruffles Canadians' feathers",
      "The speech, which will be delivered Tuesday, is not written by the king or his U.K. advisers as Charles serves as a nonpartisan head of state. He will read what is put before him by Canada's government.",
      "\"Charles can only act with the consent and with the advice of his prime minister. But at the same time he cannot act in a way that would throw any of the other 14 Commonwealth realms under the bus. So it is the finest tightrope to walk,\" said Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian.",
      "Canadians were not happy when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended a state visit invitation to Mr. Trump on behalf of the king during a time when the U.S. president threatened Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\"They weren't impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance,\" Carney told Britain's Sky News. \"It was a time when we were quite clear ... about the issues around sovereignty.\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the exchange, writing on social media that \"303 Ukrainian defenders are home.\" He noted that the troops returning were members of the \"Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and the State Special Transport Service.\"",

The talks, however, failed to produce a ceasefire between the warring countries.",
      "As such, Russia has continued its offensive on Ukraine, launching multiple drone and missile attacks amid the prisoner swap.",
      "Just hours before Sunday's exchange, Ukraine's capital and other regions came under a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack that killed at least 12 people and injured dozens.",
      "The scale of onslaught was stunning \u2014 Russia hit Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles, the largest single aerial attack of the more than three-year-long war, according to Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force.",

Okay, we're in the middle of talking, and he's shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities. I don't like it at all. I'm surprised. I'm very surprised.\"",
      "Later Sunday night, Mr. Trump wrote on social media, \"I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!\"",
      "Trump said Putin is \"needlessly killing a lot of people,\" pointing out that \"missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever.\"",
      "Mr. Trump warned that if Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine, it will \"lead to the downfall of Russia!\" But Trump expressed frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well, saying that he is \"doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does.\"",
      "\"Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don't like it, and it better stop,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "Zelenskyy said Russian missiles and drones hit more than 30 cities and villages and urged Western partners to ramp up sanctions on Russia \u2014 a longstanding demand of the Ukrainian leader but one that, despite warnings to Moscow by the United States and Europe, has not materialized in ways to deter Russia.",
      "\"These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities,\" Zelenskyy posted on social media, adding that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions.",
      "\"Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will certainly help,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Determination matters now \u2014 the determination of the United States, of European countries, and of all those around the world who seek peace.\"",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said, meanwhile, that its air defenses shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.",
      "The scale of Russia's use of aerial weapons aside, the attacks over the past 48 hours have been among the most intense strikes on Ukraine since the February 2022 invasion.",
      "Meanwhile, battles have continued along the roughly 620-mile front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry quoted Yaroslav Yakimkin of the \"North\" group of Russian forces as saying Sunday that Ukrainian troops have been pushed back from the border in the Kursk region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin visited days ago.",
      "\"The troops continue to advance forward every day,\" Yakimkin said, adding that Russian forces have taken Marine and Loknya in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, which borders Kursk, over the past week, and were advancing in the Kharkiv region around the largely destroyed town of Vovchansk.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff highlights the 'troubling trend' found in the MAHA Commission's report on childhood health issues\u00a0on 'Special Report.'",
      "Despite assurances from Trump administration officials that farmers will not be impacted by its attempts to reduce environmental chemical exposure from foods, agricultural leaders have been expressing concern that the move will explode costs for farmers and more than double the cost of food.",
      "The administration's Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission, made up of many of President Donald Trump's political appointees and closest policy advisors, released an assessment strategizing how they will tackle childhood chronic diseases, such as obesity and mental health challenges. Part of the report's focus is on children's chemical exposure from our foods, which the report says is linked to developmental issues and chronic diseases.",
      "Amid the report's release, farm groups have expressed concern over the MAHA agenda's focus on pesticides. They have said that if the administration starts clamping down on widely used pesticides, crop yields would decline, input costs would surge and food costs would more than double.",
      "DOCTOR TAKES AIM AT 'CANCER-CAUSING' PESTICIDES IN RESPONSE TO MAHA REPORT",
      "Some farmers are clapping back at a recent Make America Healthy Again report from the Trump administration, arguing it will upend decades of science by going after widely used pesticides.\u00a0 (Stephen Goin)",
      "\"Farmers are already facing a host of challenges\u2014uncertainty about their access to critical crop protection products shouldn't be added to the list,\" said Elizabeth Burns-Thompson, Executive Director of the Modern Ag Alliance. \"Crop protection tools are not only safe, they are essential to food security, affordability, and the survival of family farms all across this country. Losing access to these critical inputs would be a devastating setback to American agriculture.\"",
      "Officials from the MAHA Commission sought to reassure farmers at an event releasing their assessment on childhood chronic diseases on Thursday. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that \"at the center\" of the MAHA agenda is \"making American agriculture great again.\"",
      "\"We love our farmers, and we want to pay respect to our farmers. And we always will,\" President Trump added at the Thursday event from the White House. \"We won the farmers by a lot in the election, and every election, all three elections \u2013 and we won by a lot. I will never forget that. And they are foremost in our thought.\"",
      "But some farmers are still expressing concern.",

      "A soybean field is sprayed in Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)",
      "\"The Make America Healthy Again Report is filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides. We are deeply troubled that claims of this magnitude are being made without any scientific basis or regard for a long history of EPA expert evaluations of these products,\" the National Corn Grower's Alliance (NCGA) said. \"We call on the administration to respect the existing body of science on pesticides and, moving forward, to include America\u2019s farmers in discussion as this process evolves.\"",
      "According to a statement put out by the Modern Ag Alliance, pesticides are \"rigorously tested\" by the federal government, noting that in the case of glyphosate \u2013 mentioned multiple times in the MAHA report \u2013 it is one of the most thoroughly studied pesticides of its kind.",
      "They said that if the MAHA report drives future policy decisions it would hurt farmers and more than double the cost of food.",

      "\"Without glyphosate\u2014the most widely used weed-fighting tool by U.S. farmers\u2014crop yields would decline, input costs would surge by 150%, and food inflation would more than double,\" the group said. \"When Sri Lanka prohibited the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in 2021, crop yields fell by over 50%, forcing the government to import massive amounts of food just to meet basic needs. We should be focused on moving American agriculture\u2014and the country\u2014forward.\"",
      "The Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition of farmers, has said that policy decisions from the Trump administration clamping down on pesticides could more than double the cost of food.\u00a0 (iSTOCK)",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been a vocal opponent against the dangerous health impacts of under-regulated pesticides even before he was the MAHA Commission's leader, said last week in a Senate hearing that \"we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business.\"",
      "\"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate,\" he said. \"100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "FARMERS COME FIRST AS INITIATIVE AIMS TO LOWER THEIR COSTS, GET FRESH FOOD TO AMERICANS MORE EFFICIENTLY",
      "The MAHA report reiterates the economic importance of protecting farmers, but it also lists glyphosate in an infographic of \"Chemical Classes and Common Exposure Pathways\" and says research studies have shown it can cause a range of health effects. It also lists atrazine and other chemicals as dangerous to childhood health.",
      "MAHA Commission officials have said that part of the administration's focus will be a return to the gold standard of science, but the NCGA said the focus on certain widely-used pesticides, such as atrazine and glyphosate, goes against \"decades of extensive research and testing.\"",
      "\"If the administration\u2019s goal is to bring more efficiency to government, then why is the secretary of Health and Human Services duplicating efforts by raising questions about pesticides that have been answered repeatedly through research and reviews by federal regulatory bodies?\" the group questioned.",

Kennedy Jr. have sought to reassure farmers that they will not be negatively impacted by the Make America Healthy Again agenda.\u00a0 (Getty Images/Greg Nash/Pool/AFP/Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg/Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance)",
      "Jennifer Galardi, a senior policy analyst focused on health and wellness issues at the Heritage Foundation, took a more balanced view of the MAHA commission's strategy towards pesticides like glyphosate, noting that it appeared to thread the needle between supporting farmers and trying to ensure America's food supply is safe and free of chemicals that could impact child health.",
      "\"The MAHA Commission Report seems to carefully examine competing issues in a very complex agricultural debate: the potential that crop protection tools as they\u2019re referred to in the report may cause adverse health outcomes and the desire to protect the economic interests of farmers and the country,\" Galardi said. \"However, everyone should agree that the companies that manufacture products such as glyphosate and GMO\u2019s shouldn\u2019t have undue influence over the research upon which sound policy is based. The American public should demand transparency around these decisions.\"",
      "Galardi posited that, due to the tension around the issue of pesticides, the MAHA Commission may decide to go after \"low-hanging fruit,\" such as improving children's diets and lack of physical activity, which, she said, are big drivers of obesity and metabolic dysfunction.",

      "In response to this article, a USDA spokesperson sent the following statement from Secretary Rollins:",
      "\"We must do more to improve the health outcomes of our kids and families, and President Trump knows agriculture is at the heart of the solution. America\u2019s farmers and ranchers dedicate their lives to the noble cause of feeding their country and the world, and in doing so have created the safest and most abundant and affordable food supply in the world. We are working to make sure our kids and families are consuming the healthiest food we produce. I look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Kennedy and other members of the MAHA Commission to improve our nation\u2019s health.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai, in a separate statement, echoed Rollins' sentiment about the importance of agriculture and farmers when it comes to executing the MAHA mission. He also reiterated that the MAHA movement is grounded in \"Gold Standard of Science.\"",
      "\"The guiding principle of President Trump\u2019s movement to Make America Healthy Again is the Gold Standard of Science, and everyone from America\u2019s farmers to everyday parents are critical for the success of this movement,\" Desai said. \"The MAHA Commission\u2019s report is a historic step by our government to, for the first time, comprehensively review the latest evidence and research of what we know \u2013 and what we don\u2019t know \u2013 is driving the health crisis afflicting America\u2019s children.\""

      "Have you ever wished your daily commute could be as easy and comfortable as driving a car, but as fun and eco-friendly as riding a bike? You are not alone. That is exactly the kind of thinking that inspired the Acticycle. This four-wheeled electric vehicle is shaking up city transportation by blending the best parts of both worlds. With the Acticycle, you get the comfort, weather protection, and storage you would expect from a car, but with the agility, efficiency, and low cost of a bike.",

      "Let's start with the numbers, since they really set the\u00a0Acticycle apart. The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",

With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat.

While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

      "We stay on top of updates for our phones and laptops. Some of us even make sure our smartwatches and security cameras are running the latest firmware. But routers often get overlooked. If it's working, we assume it's fine, but that mindset can be risky.",
      "Now, the FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals are actively exploiting old, unpatched and outdated routers. The alert, released in May 2025, explains how aging network devices with known flaws are being hijacked by malware and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations. A forgotten device in your home can silently become a tool for attackers.",

      "Devices manufactured around 2010 or earlier are especially vulnerable, as vendors have long ceased providing firmware updates for them. According to the FBI, such end-of-life routers have been breached by cyber actors using a variant of the \"TheMoon\" malware, allowing attackers to install proxy services on the devices and conduct illicit activities anonymously.",
      "In essence, home and small-office routers are being quietly conscripted into proxy networks that mask the perpetrators' identities online. The alert notes that through networks like \"5socks\" and \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes. In these schemes, paying customers can route their internet traffic through unwitting victims' routers, obscuring their own location while the victim's device (and IP address) bears the blame.",

      "WHAT EXACTLY IS A DATA BREACH? WHY SHOULD I CARE?",
      "How hackers exploit these routers",
      "Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.",
      "One prominent threat is\u00a0TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless and 5socks sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.",
      "For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance.",

      "Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.",
      "1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:\u00a0If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.",
      "If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of\u00a0top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with\u00a0VPN services.",
      "2) Keep your router's firmware updated:\u00a0Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.",
      "3) Turn off remote access:\u00a0Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is\u00a0disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.",
      "4) Use a strong password for your router settings:\u00a0Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like\u00a0T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:\u00a0If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.",
      "6) Reporting to authorities:\u00a0The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets. The real challenge isn't just technical. It's about how manufacturers, service providers and users all handle the long tail of aging tech that still lives on in the real world.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses LEVA, the autonomous robot that walks, rolls and lifts 187 pounds of cargo for all-terrain deliveries.",
      "Autonomous delivery robots are already starting to change the way goods move around cities and warehouses, but most still need humans to load and unload their cargo. That's where LEVA comes in. Developed by engineers and designers from ETH Zurich and other Swiss universities, LEVA is a robot that can not only navigate tricky environments but also lift and carry heavy boxes all on its own, making deliveries smoother and more efficient.",

      "Delivery robot (LEVA) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes LEVA different?",
      "Most delivery robots either roll on wheels or walk on legs, but LEVA combines both. It has four legs, and each leg ends with a motorized, steerable wheel. This means on smooth surfaces like sidewalks, LEVA can roll quickly and efficiently, almost like a little car. When it encounters stairs, curbs or rough ground, it locks its wheels and walks or climbs like a four-legged animal. This unique design lets LEVA handle both flat urban streets and uneven terrain with ease.",

      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How LEVA sees and moves around",
      "LEVA uses a mix of GPS, lidar sensors and five cameras placed around its body to understand its surroundings. These tools help it navigate city streets or indoor hallways while avoiding obstacles. One camera even looks downward to help LEVA line itself up perfectly when it's time to pick up or drop off cargo.",

      "DRIVERLESS BIG-RIG ROBOTRUCKS ARE NOW ON THE ROAD IN THIS STATE",
      "The big deal: Loading and unloading itself",
      "What really sets LEVA apart is its ability to load and unload cargo boxes without any human help. It spots a standard cargo box, moves right over it, lowers itself by bending its legs and then locks onto the box using powered hooks underneath its body. After securing the box, LEVA lifts itself back up and carries the load to its destination. It can handle boxes weighing up to 187 pounds, which is pretty impressive for a robot of its size.",

Farmers might use it to move supplies across fields. On construction sites, it could carry tools and materials over uneven ground. It might even assist in emergency situations by bringing supplies through rubble or rough terrain.",
      "Delivery robot (LEVA) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you?",
      "For folks like us, LEVA could mean faster, more reliable deliveries, especially in tricky urban areas where stairs and curbs often slow things down. For businesses, it means cutting down on the need for manual labor to load and unload heavy items, which can reduce injuries and lower costs.",
      "It also means deliveries and material handling could happen around the clock without breaks, boosting efficiency. In industries like farming, construction and emergency response, LEVA's ability to get through tough terrain while carrying heavy loads could make a big difference in how quickly and safely supplies get where they need to go.",

      "A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.",
      "Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they\u2019ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well).",
      "Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it\u2019s still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:",
      "\"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\"",
      "I get what you\u2019re saying, Frank. You\u2019d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn\u2019t be bypassed. But you\u2019d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they\u2019re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.",

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.",
      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage.\u00a0Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

    "summary": "Massive password leak reveals cybersecurity flaws. Learn how to protect your accounts with strong passwords, two-factor authentication and data removal services.",
    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password.",
      "The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is.",
      "Security researchers have uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered by\u00a0Cybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique.",
      "Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere.",
      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

A single compromised password can trigger a domino effect, exposing multiple accounts across services. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

      "Four ways to stay safe from password-stealing scammers",
      "Protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are four effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "When it comes down to it, passwords just aren't cutting it anymore. The sheer number of leaked passwords and the fact that so few are unique show how vulnerable we really are. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation. It might take a little effort to change old habits, but the peace of mind you get is worth it.",

      "For Caroline Laubach, being a Wandercraft test pilot is about more than just trying out new technology. It's about reclaiming a sense of freedom and connection that many wheelchair users miss. Laubach, a spinal stroke survivor and full-time wheelchair user, has played a key role in\u00a0demonstrating the personal AI-powered prototype exoskeleton's development, and her experience highlights just how life-changing this device can be.",
      "\"When I'm in the exoskeleton, I feel more free than I do in my daily life,\" said Laubach. \"It gives me the opportunity to walk around and talk to people at eye level. I don't have to look up at people all the time.",

      "Wandercraft's journey began with a personal challenge. Nicolas Simon, the company's co-founder, saw his own family members struggle with mobility due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic condition. As a student and robotics enthusiast, Simon wanted to create something that could help his brother and others like him walk again.

The team uses Nvidia Isaac Sim, a powerful simulation tool, to test and improve the exoskeleton in virtual environments before real-world trials. They're also exploring Nvidia's healthcare robotics and edge computing platforms to make the device smarter and more responsive.",
      "This technology means the exoskeleton can someday keep up with everyday life, walking at a normal pace, crossing streets, and even handling stairs. As Simon puts it, \"It's essential for the exoskeleton to be fast enough that it can be used in the real world. By integrating NVIDIA AI into the device, we can someday enable users to walk at an average pace, cross the road, and go up and down stairs.\"",

      "You\u2019re using AI when:",
      "Your email suggests repliesYour phone transcribes your voiceNetflix recommends what to watch next",
      "Your email suggests replies",
      "Your phone transcribes your voice",
      "Netflix recommends what to watch next",
      "Think of AI as the category; everything else on this list is a branch of it. It\u2019s the foundation for all the smart tools we use today, from voice assistants to facial recognition. As AI continues to evolve, it has the power to make everyday tasks easier, faster and more personalized. But as it becomes more embedded in our lives, understanding the basics is key to using it wisely and protecting your digital autonomy.",

      "2. Machine learning (ML)",
      "How AI learns patterns",
      "Machine Learning is a type of AI that learns from data instead of being explicitly programmed. It improves over time by finding patterns and making predictions.",
      "For example:\u00a0You like action movies. You watch a few. Over time, the algorithm learns your preferences and recommends similar titles, even if you didn\u2019t say anything directly.",

      "ML is how AI \"gets smarter\" by itself, and it's a big part of how tech becomes more helpful and intuitive. From catching suspicious charges on your credit card to curating your favorite music, machine learning can make life more seamless and even safer. But as with any technology, it\u2019s important to stay aware of how your data is being used and who\u2019s doing the learning. The more we understand how it works, the better we can decide how and when to trust it.",

      "Face ID unlocking your phone",
      "Speech-to-text apps",
      "Translating text in real time",
      "If AI is the brain, neural networks are the brain cells doing the work. Neural networks are the part of AI that actually processes information. They\u2019re designed to mimic how human brains work, taking in data, learning patterns and making decisions. So, when AI recognizes a face, writes a sentence or makes a suggestion, it\u2019s neural networks making that happen behind the scenes.",

      "Think you can tell the difference?Be sure to\u00a0play my game to guess which photo is AI and which one is real. It\u2019s harder than you think and a good reminder that as these tools get more advanced, staying alert and informed is more important than ever.",

      "\"Create a recipe using only chickpeas and chocolate\"",
      "\"Make an image of a robot drinking coffee in Paris, 1920s style\"",
      "Prompts are to AI what questions are to Google, but with more creativity and conversation. Unlike a search engine that simply points you to existing content, AI can generate entirely new ideas, images and text based on what you ask. It\u2019s more than a search box; it\u2019s a creative tool. Whether you\u2019re drafting a story, designing a logo or planning a vacation, learning how to prompt effectively lets you tap into AI\u2019s full potential as a collaborator, not just an information source.",

      "You don\u2019t need a computer science degree to understand AI, just a few solid definitions. From\u00a0machine learning and\u00a0neural networks to\u00a0generative AI and\u00a0prompts, these tools are no longer reserved for tech labs; they're becoming part of your everyday life. Whether it\u2019s helping you write an email, organize your photos or get dinner ideas based on what\u2019s in your fridge, AI is already working behind the scenes to make life a little easier (and sometimes a lot more interesting).",

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the \"Decoding Broken Hearts\" initiative on \"Special Report.\"",
      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "New York City subway (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system. This is intended to protect rider privacy.",

      "Crime in NYC subways has seen ups and downs over recent years. While major crimes dropped by about 7.7% through mid-2024, assaults have unfortunately increased. To bolster safety, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,000 National Guard members to support transit police efforts.

      "Is AI being used in public transit elsewhere?",

We do not yet know exactly which behaviors the system will flag or how effective it will be in practice. Perhaps more importantly, privacy advocates and civil liberties groups warn about potential biases in AI systems and the risk of false positives that could unfairly target certain groups.",
      "The MTA's decision to exclude facial recognition is a positive step, but ongoing transparency and oversight will be crucial. Michael Kemper's extensive experience leading the NYPD's Transit Bureau, where he helped reduce subway crime, adds credibility to the initiative. Still, as this technology rolls out, balancing safety with privacy and fairness will be key to earning public trust.",

      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses tips on how to protect your data amid AI privacy concerns and Ford filing a patent to bring the stick shift to electric vehicles.",
      "Removing your personal information from people-search sites can feel pretty overwhelming. There are hundreds of these sites in the U.S. alone. In fact, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says there are over 500 companies that collect and sell personal information.",
      "At first, it might seem impossible to get your details removed from all of them. But here's the good news: You don't need to tackle every single site. Your information isn't on all 500-plus sites.",
      "With a bit of time and persistence, you can remove your info from the major ones, and every removal really counts. Let me show you exactly how to do it yourself.",

      "A woman scrolling on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "First, find which people-search sites have your info",
      "The process will be easier if you have a list of people-search sites that have your personal information. Not only can you check them off as you go, but you'll also need a list for the last step. The easiest place to start is with a\u00a0free scan that some data removal services provide. These scans automatically check a ton of people-search sites for your personal information and send you a report. You can also search for your full name on Google. This will probably bring up a mix of results, including your social media profiles.",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR DATA YOURSELF? HERE'S WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG",
      "The bigger your online presence, the more search results you'll likely have to sift through to find the people-search sites. I recommend searching for your name together with other personal details, like your email, phone number or home address. For some reason, this is more likely to bring up people-search sites, different ones depending on the combination of personal details you try. You may not be able to find all the people-search sites that have your info like this, though. You should also check any state-specific people-search sites, like\u00a0StateofFlorida.com, and search all of the most popular people-search sites like:",

      "Keep in mind that many smaller or niche sites exist, especially those that are state or region-specific. These sites can be harder to find but may still have your information. Using scanning tools or data removal services can help uncover these less obvious listings.",
      "Follow the opt-out process for each site",
      "Every people-search site has its own opt-out process, but most of them will require you to do something like this:",
      "Find your listing:\u00a0You'll usually need to search for your name, phone number, address or email on the site.Submit a removal request:\u00a0Most sites have an online form where you can request removal. Look for links that say \"Opt-Out,\" \"Do Not Sell My Info\" or \"Privacy Rights,\" which are usually found in the website footer.Verify your request:\u00a0Most sites will send you a confirmation email with a link you'll need to click. Some ask for a phone call verification. A few people-search sites request documents, like a photo ID (I recommend avoiding sending sensitive documents unless absolutely necessary). If a site insists on ID verification, try contacting their support to ask about alternative methods or consider skipping that site if you're uncomfortable.",

      "Pro tip: Use a separate email address for opt-out requests",
      "Many sites require email verification. Using your regular email can expose it to spam or further data collection. Creating a dedicated or alias email address just for these requests helps protect your primary inbox and keeps things organized. Also, using various email aliases makes it so you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone verification and a secondary number",
      "If a site requires phone verification, consider using a secondary number to avoid exposing your personal phone number. Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public. This is a separate process, but it is worth doing alongside removing info from people-search sites.",
      "Google Search image (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Keep in mind, this isn't a one-and-done deal",
      "Even after you remove your info, there's a good chance it'll show up again. People-search sites constantly scrape public records and other databases to refresh their listings. Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed. Maintaining a detailed tracker or spreadsheet with the sites you've contacted, dates and confirmation info can make this easier and help you avoid missing any sites.",

      "\u200b\u200bA quick note on your rights (updated for 2025)",
      "There is still no federal data privacy law in the U.S. that grants everyone the automatic right to opt out of people-search sites.

      "Maryland (Maryland Online Data Privacy Act - MODPA)",
      "If you live in one of these states, you now have a much stronger legal footing to demand that people-search sites remove your information. Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.",

      "\"First of all, that jail had been deemed a train wreck in terms of just basic jail operations,\" Cameron Lindsay told Fox News Digital.",
      "Lindsay worked for 20 years in the federal prison system, seven of them as a warden. He was once the warden of the infamous Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He also served as a warden at two private prisons. Now, he is a consultant and expert witness.",
      "\"It would appear that basic security inspections were not taking place at the jail. Inmates should never be able to tear a toilet off of a wall and just be able to go right to the perimeter fence,\" he said. \"I mean, I just can't believe that.\"",

      "In 2013, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office (OPSO), which runs the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility, entered into a consent decree with the Department of Justice to keep the jail operational. The decree stemmed from civil rights abuses, and OPSO agreed to federal government oversight and biannual compliance checks.",
      "The latest of those compliance check reports shows that the jail was fully compliant with 42% of the decree's measures and completely noncompliant with at least 5% of them. It is partially compliant with about 53% of the measures.",
      "The report, released in October 2024, paints a picture of completely inadequate inmate supervision, leading to violence and the use of illicit drugs, shakedown and extortion schemes, and inmates having limitless time to fashion weapons out of everyday jail items.",
      "Sheriff Susan Hutson speaks at City Hall in New Orleans on May 20, 2025. (Sophia Germer/Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP)",

      "\"The inmates appear to be emboldened in their refusal to follow the rules and obey the orders of the security staff,\" the report said. \"Very concerning is that both staff and inmates continue to relay to the Monitors that there are inmates who are acting as \u2018tank bosses\u2019 and are extorting other inmates and requiring payment for protection.\"",
      "Law enforcement searches for a fugitive in New Orleans on May 21, 2025. (Chris Granger/Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP)",
      "There was also no jail monitoring system to verify that security checks were taking place and being reported at regular intervals.",
      "Those failures have come into focus since the early morning hours of May 17, when 10 inmates broke out of the jail and ran amok in the New Orleans area.",
      "As of Friday afternoon, five of them remained at large.",

      "One of the 10 escapees was Antoine Massey, who was being held in the jail on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation, theft of a motor vehicle and a parole violation. He was also wanted for rape and kidnapping in St. Tammany Parish, according to Fox 8.",
      "Massey had escaped from custody three times since 2007 and was no longer eligible to be released with an electronic ankle monitor because he kept cutting them off.",

      "\"He would be housed in the most secure location within the jail,\" he said. \"All staff would be apprised of this individual, and given his incredibly high risk for escape, I would require documented frequent checks at least once every 30 minutes on an irregular schedule.\"",

      "\"And I tell you what, here's another thing that speaks to me about the ineffectiveness of this facility,\" he said. \"I would tell you that they don't know the first thing about emergency preparedness, because when you have an escape, there should be an immediate response. There should be no delay whatsoever. That information should go out to law enforcement and through the community.\"",

      "\"Our research has found so far that before [Thompson's murder], people felt powerless.

      "The UK is considering a range of options from a new report, which aims to cut the country\u2019s prison population by 10,000 inmates to help alleviate chronic overcrowding.",
      "\"Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offense under certain circumstances,\" the new report states.",
      "Prisons in the south-west of England have been involved in a pilot program of chemical castrations since 2002, and Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood from the ruling Labour Party told lawmakers in parliament on Thursday that the program would expand to 20 more prisons in two other regions of England.",

One recent study found that reoffending rates were up to 60% lower for prisoners who had received the treatment.",
      "\"For some, offending relates to power, but for another subset of offenders, the combination of chemical suppressants and psychological interventions can, we believe, have a big and positive impact,\" Minister Mahmood told parliament.",
      "Initially, the option for chemical castration treatment would be only voluntary, and medical ethicists say it could be a problem to force doctors to treat an inmate who doesn\u2019t want to have it done.

(Photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images)",
      "Sex offenders make up a significant percentage of the prison population in England, and at the end of March, more than 20% of inmates were incarcerated on sex crimes charges. The new report cautions that chemical castration \"should never be used as a risk management tool or standalone rehabilitative offer, and it is only appropriate for a limited number of sex offenders\".",
      "Chemical castration is already being used in some other European prisons to treat sex offenders. Authorities in Sweden have been carrying out limited clinical trials on volunteers at a Stockholm prison, while in Germany and Denmark it is more widely used but still on a voluntary basis. In Poland, courts can pass a sentence of mandatory chemical castration for some categories of sex-offense prisoners.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report, written by a former government minister from the Conservative Party, also made four dozen recommendations to try and ease prison overcrowding.",
      "These include giving fewer people jail sentences under 12 months and encouraging other types of punishment instead, such as community service or fines; developing new policies for early release with good behavior for inmates, and tagging all offenders who committed crimes of abuse against women and girls.",

      "The future of international students at the oldest, richest and most renowned university in the U.S. is uncertain after the Trump administration announced a ban on their enrollment starting in the 2025-26 academic year.",
      "After Harvard refused to turn over extensive data about its international students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the school was being held accountable for \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\u201d",
      "Harvard has sued over the move, calling it unlawful, and on Friday a federal judge in Boston put it on hold for two weeks. If the Trump administration prevails, new international students would be barred from enrolling at Harvard while current ones would be forced to either transfer elsewhere or lose their legal status.",
      "U.S. universities including Harvard rely heavily on international students, who often pay far more in tuition than their American classmates. Many of them end up staying in the U.S., where they have been responsible for major breakthroughs in strategically important fields such as artificial intelligence where the U.S., China and other nations are locked in intense competition.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign against Harvard is a \u201cterrible policy error\u201d that could undermine the world-leading role the U.S. has played in research and development since World War II, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "A downturn in international students would affect American universities\u2019 \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d and income, while benefiting U.S. competitors, he said. \u201cChina will become significantly more attractive than before to students and researchers from the Global South,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWestern Europe will also gain significantly.\u201d",
      "There was already growing unease among international students at U.S. universities amid anti-immigrant rhetoric by Trump, in addition to deep funding cuts and efforts to intervene in universities\u2019 internal operations. Hundreds of students\u2019 visas have been revoked, while the Trump administration has detained and sought to deport others over pro-Palestinian and other activism.",
      "At Harvard, more than a quarter of the student body of about 25,000 comes from overseas and the looming ban has caught up students from more than 140 countries, including the future queen of Belgium.",

      "After Kamala Harris entered the presidential race last year, she reached out to Barack Obama campaign alum Jim Messina to help lead her White House bid.",
      "But when Messina shared news of the vice president\u2019s offer with a friend, he received a stern warning.",
      "\u201cI said \u2018Jim, if you get involved in this, it\u2019ll be political suicide,\u2019\u201d Democratic megadonor John Morgan, a longtime Harris critic, recalled of his conversation with Messina, who had served in Obama\u2019s White House and managed his successful 2012 re-election campaign. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a loser. And your whole shine is you\u2019re undefeated.\u201d",
      "Messina declined the job. And after Harris\u2019 loss to Donald Trump, it may not have been a bad move.",
      "David Plouffe, long hailed as the brilliant architect of Obama\u2019s 2008 victory, served in a key role in Harris\u2019 campaign and is now among those tagged with a devastating defeat.",
      "\u201cThe shine\u2019s off Plouffe now. He was the golden boy,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cNow he\u2019s just an old broken-down boy, who lost. Big.\u201d",
      "Messina did not comment on the exchange. Plouffe did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "While many Democrats still admire Plouffe\u2019s successes, the harsh words punctuated a growing sentiment across a party searching for a path forward: Team Obama\u2019s bloom may be falling off the rose.",
      "More Democrats are openly criticizing Obama strategists and consultants, who were long treated as the high priests of their party\u2019s politics. Democratic National Committee officials at a news event last month blamed Obama\u2019s lack of investment in state parties over his two terms for setting back local organizing, with the party still feeling the effects. The so-called Obama coalition of voters \u2014 less politically engaged voters, younger voters and voters of color \u2014 is no more. In 2024, each of those groups shifted toward Trump in high numbers.",
      "Going forward, it could mark a clean slate for a party whose course for nearly two decades cascaded from decisions Obama had made. It was Obama who chose Biden as his vice president, offering him the elevated perch that set up his 2020 election and his aborted 2024 re-election. Obama selected Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state, then anointed her for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race against Trump. The operatives Obama and his top aides empowered have carved out leading, decision-making roles at the top of the Democratic Party since then.",
      "But after 2024, more Democrats want to see that change.",
      "Obama himself remains a force in the party, filling stadiums and commanding the attention of major donors. Indeed, the DNC is in talks with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to host Obama for a fundraiser at his home, according to two people with knowledge of the planning, which is still in its early stages.",
      "But even the former president\u2019s luster was showing signs of fading last fall, a phenomenon that threatens to persist as the next crop of young voters ages into adulthood. When the 2028 presidential election arrives, it will be 20 years since Obama\u2019s first victory. At that point, more voters will have come of age in the era of Donald Trump than in the era of Obama.",
      "\u201cOne of the challenges the Democratic Party does have is that there is nostalgia for the Obama era, both in terms of Barack Obama being in the White House and what that meant for the country and the style of leadership that we have, but also like the style of our politics,\u201d Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a de-evolution of our politics over the last 10 years, and it\u2019s just a very different era.\u201d",
      "Criticism flying within the party",
      "Democrats point to myriad factors leading to Harris\u2019 defeat in 2024 \u2014 with many focusing on a compressed timeline because Biden refused to step aside as the party\u2019s candidate until 107 days before the election. Plouffe pointedly blamed Biden, saying \u201cHe totally f---ed us\u201d in a newly released book.",
      "Plouffe\u2019s verbal affront opened him and fellow Obama alums to their own criticisms. DNC Finance Chair Chris Korge lashed out at Plouffe in an interview with NBC News last week, saying he and other Obama alums shared the blame, chiding them as the \u201cso-called gurus.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to re-evaluate the use of consultants and bring in new forward-looking people,\u201d Korge also said in the interview. \u201cThe old Obama playbook no longer works.\u201d",
      "Jane Kleeb \u2014 the Nebraska Democratic Party chair, a DNC vice chair and the president of a national group of state party chairs \u2014 said Democrats need to get back to the basics of investing in and listening to local stakeholders and organizers. She said this realization crystalized during the recent Omaha mayoral election, when Republicans attacked the Democratic candidate on transgender issues. She said the party \u201cscrewed up\u201d in 2024 by not pushing back on those attacks on candidates up and down the ticket.",
      "This time, she said, she knew whom to get into a room to tackle the issue.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t contact the Pod Save America guys or a New York press firm to say, \u2018How do I handle this?\u2019\u201d Kleeb said. \u201cOur team literally got into the conference room at our state party office and said, \u2018Let\u2019s throw out ideas on how we can push back on this, because we\u2019re not going to let them take down John Ewing on this bulls--- again.\u2019\u201d",
      "They went basic, flipping the script in a new ad: Mayor Jean Stothert was \u201cfocused on potties;\u201d Democratic candidate Ewing was \u201cfocused on fixing potholes.\u201d Ewing ended up ousting the longtime incumbent by nearly 13 points, after Stothert had trounced her past opponents.",
      "\u201cAnd that resonated with voters,\u201d Kleeb said, adding: \u201cThe reality for state parties on the ground is we don\u2019t give a s--- about what camp a political consultant cut their teeth in.\u201d",
      "As far as she\u2019s concerned, she said, she welcomes any and all Democrats \u2014 those who worked for any Democratic president and beyond \u2014\u00a0to be in the room.",
      "\u201cOur party is looking at these philosophical questions and missing the point that we need to trust the people in the states who are on the ground, who are constantly in touch with voters, and just let this intraparty fighting and whose camp is better \u2014 let it go,\u201d Kleeb said. \u201cI want them all at the table.\u201d",
      "Other Democrats echoed the sentiment. One longtime Biden ally, Steve Schale, who also worked on Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, specifically defended Plouffe\u2019s contributions to the party.",
      "\u201cDavid is one of the sharpest guys around. I was grateful he stepped up and joined the campaign, and anyone who thinks his voice isn\u2019t needed, quite frankly, is an idiot,\u201d Schale said. \u201cDavid has also been clear-eyed about what we need to do going forward \u2026 He\u2019s done enough in his life that he has earned the right to take his ball and go home, but for one, I am glad he remains engaged.\u201d",
      "Chuck Rocha, who worked on Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential bid and consults on House and Senate campaigns, said that a small cluster of firms dominate the market for political operatives.",
      "\u201cMost of these same consultants have locked in these candidates before they ever announce, and so there\u2019s never any opportunity for any new blood to be a part of these campaigns,\u201d said Rocha, who helped freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., win his seat in 2024.",
      "He said the firms rise and fall, but the players who run them are the same \u2014 a sort of regeneration cycle that keeps the same people in place. \u201cThey\u2019re all connected,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2024, Biden-Harris campaign chief Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon tapped fellow Obama alumni for major roles. For example, Stephanie Cutter, managing partner of O\u2019Malley Dillon\u2019s old firm, Precision Strategies, was picked to help run the Democratic convention program and prep Harris for media interviews. 270 Strategies founding partner Mitch Stewart, who managed battleground states for Obama, was brought on to oversee a similar program for Biden. Rufus Gifford, the big-donor wrangler for Obama, acted as director of fundraising for the Biden campaign. The list goes on.",
      "Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist with experience on past presidential campaigns, said it\u2019s time for the party to take a hard look at the same set of operatives, including Obama campaign alums, who have been running national Democratic campaigns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I don\u2019t want a surgeon who keeps killing patients,\u201d he said.",
      "Some victories, he noted, are a reflection of the skills of the candidate, rather than the operatives around them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to win with a guy like Obama,\u201d Kofinis said, adding that Democrats tend to put too much emphasis on experience when they hire operatives, rather than \u201cwhether they\u2019re any good\u201d at their jobs.",
      "Activist and DNC vice chair David Hogg said that just as some elected Democrats cling to power for too long, so too does the party\u2019s operative class.",
      "He sees an anti-establishment fervor that began with Obama and continues to this day, where candidates who are perceived to be going against the system will be more successful than those who pledge to uphold or defend it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine this now, because Obama is such a major figurehead, obviously he\u2019s seen as part of the system, but when he ran, he ran, I would argue, as an anti-establishment candidate,\u201d said Hogg, who has faced pushback for holding a DNC position while also advocating for primary challenges against some party incumbents. Aside from a unique, Covid-fueled election in 2020, he continued, \u201cthe challenge is, we are still in a moment where anti system candidates are going to be favored.\u201d",
      "What's next for Democrats",
      "But with political operatives who cut their teeth in the Obama years still wielding power in the party, there\u2019s a disconnect between the leadership and younger electorates the party needs to win moving forward, Hogg added. Part of the issue is that those young voters barely have any memory of the nation\u2019s first Black president.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they have one to be honest with you. That\u2019s part of the challenge,\u201d Hogg, 25, said, adding, \u201cFor many of these younger people who are under the age of 20, right now \u2026 they don\u2019t remember much of what Obama talked about. They grew up in the political context of Donald Trump and him being normalized, because that was what politics was to them growing up.\u201d",
      "Ammar Moussa, a campaign aide to both Biden and Harris, noted that a natural changing of the guard is likely already underway. For starters, many of the governors filling up the short-list of leading contenders for the party\u2019s 2028 nomination have their own longtime political hands, some of them incubated far from Democratic Party headquarters in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe should always think about how we are elevating operatives and promoting their staff who understand the landscape and what it takes to win campaigns in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, because every cycle is different,\u201d Moussa said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon candidates and senior staffers and the senior consulting class to know what they don\u2019t know.\u201d"

    "summary": "A Supreme Court order that provided more questions than answers is jeopardizing the legal immigration status of Venezuelans with TPS.",
    "story": [
      "A 10-year-old Venezuelan girl living in New York City with a special legal protection against deportation has repeatedly asked her mother the same question all week: \u201cMommy, what am I going to do if immigration comes?\u201d",
      "The girl, her two siblings and her parents are among the 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants who have been living and working in the U.S. with temporary protected status, better known as TPS, for the past two years.",
      "But a one-page Supreme Court order issued last week, which provided more questions than answers, jeopardized the legal immigration status of Venezuelans with TPS \u2014 eliciting uncertainty, anguish and a sense of betrayal for families at risk of losing their protections.",
      "\u201cThat makes you feel very depressed, anxious and distressed,\u201d the mother of the little girl told NBC News in her native Spanish. \u201cThis is all terrible.\u201d",
      "With no clear timeline, the Supreme Court gave President Donald Trump and his administration the green light to continue their efforts to end the protections granted to these Venezuelans in 2023 by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "NBC News spoke with the mother in New York City and two other Venezuelan TPS holders, one in North Carolina and one in Los Angeles, about navigating changing immigration policies at a time when the Trump administration is rolling back temporary protections and other legal immigration programs for refugees and asylum-seekers \u2014 consequently expanding the pool of possible deportees as the president seeks to deliver on his campaign promise of mass deportations.",
      "All three TPS holders requested their names not be published for safety reasons, as they expressed worries about their protections against deportation under TPS.",
      "TPS is considered a humanitarian designation under U.S. law for nationals of certain countries experiencing war, natural disasters or other serious crises that would make it unsafe for them to return.",
      "Beneficiaries are allowed to remain in the U.S. legally and get work authorization for up to 18 months \u2014 subject to extensions.",
      "That is the case for a young political scientist who fled government persecution in her native Venezuela to settle in North Carolina. She has TPS and was overcome with frustration after she saw the Supreme Court\u2019s order Monday, she said.",
      "\u201cBeing in that limbo feels like a right that you already acquired has been taken away from you,\u201d she said, adding that TPS holders like her did everything right to meet requirements and paid hundreds of dollars in work permits and application fees.",
      "'Still searching for a better future'",
      "Affected TPS holders are part of one of the world\u2019s largest migration crises. Over 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland over the past decade \u2014 escaping rampant violence, inflation, organized crime and political repression from a regime accused of repeatedly violating human rights, as well as shortages of food and medicine and a lack of essential services such as electricity and health care.",
      "After being persecuted for the nature of her work, the political scientist arrived to the U.S. in 2022 on a visa. Applying for and receiving TPS under the 2023 designation gave her much-needed \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d she said. That meant, \u201cI\u2019m in a safe place and I\u2019m legally here.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes everything in your daily life,\u201d she said, adding the protections helped her shed the fears of persecution and human rights violations she faced in Venezuela and start a new chapter, personally and professionally.",
      "Biden had extended TPS until October 2026 before leaving office. But the Department of Homeland Security rescinded that extension shortly after Trump took office, moving to end the program for Venezuelans under the 2023 TPS designation. Litigation is underway to determine whether the program stays until next year or ends earlier.",
      "But what happens in the meantime? This is the nerve-racking question that has been circling in the mind of the Venezuelan mother in New York City all week. All five members of her family obtained TPS under the 2023 designation for Venezuelan nationals.",
      "The mother said her husband, who has been recovering from an accident that injured his back, did not go to his follow-up appointments this week. Her three daughters attended their last week of school with renewed fears that they or their parents could be detained and deported.",
      "Since having TPS, the mother landed a \u201cdecent job caring for elders\u201d that allowed her to provide for her family and open a bank account to move toward a financially stable future, she said, adding that her family consistently complies with immigration appointments and requirements.",
      "Because of this, she sees the Trump administration\u2019s insistence on ending TPS for Venezuelans like her as unfair, she said.",
      "The family not only fears the prospect of losing deportation protections and employment authorization if TPS ends, but also worries about \u201cbeing denigrated and facing xenophobia again\u201d in their everyday life following the Supreme Court order, the mother said.",
      "From walking through the jungle to enduring cold temperatures and hunger on their trek to the U.S., she said she found herself reflecting back on everything her family has done \u201cto reach a country where one is still searching for a better future.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s why Niurka Mel\u00e9ndez, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker and the director and founder of Venezuelans and Immigrants Aid in New York City, has been leading volunteer and grassroots efforts to ensure her community is not \u201cparalyzed by fear,\u201d helping people seek trustworthy information and available legal resources.",
      "'I feel betrayed'",
      "From making deliveries to working in a labor organization, another Venezuelan mother with TPS in Los Angeles works multiple jobs to support herself and her family in Venezuela.",
      "She said the crisis in her homeland is so bad that her 30-year-old daughter, a dentist in Venezuela, can\u2019t make ends meet. She sends money to help her and her aging parents survive and get basic goods they may not have due to shortages.",
      "For her, returning to Venezuela would not just mean going back to a homeland riddled with ailments. It would also mean that her family in Venezuela would lose a source of financial support they depend on, said the TPS-holding woman in Los Angeles.",
      "She, like many other Venezuelans, had believed Trump had what it took to stand against the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela and pave the way for the possible return of those who have fled.",
      "\u201cBut I was wrong,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "DHS said in a February memo announcing its intention to end TPS for Venezuelans under the 2023 designation that Venezuela has seen \u201cnotable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.\u201d",
      "The mother in Los Angeles said she knows that\u2019s not true based on her conversations with relatives in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cNow, I feel betrayed,\u201d she added.",
      "In New York, immigration attorney Edward Cuccia was flooded with calls from hundreds of his TPS clients last week as they try to determine what to do next.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a vast number of people who ran away from a terrible situation down in Venezuela, which has not gotten any better,\u201d Cuccia said. \u201cTheir status is all in limbo.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration may attempt to strip protections from these Venezuelans to have them ready for expedited removal, Cuccia said. But if due process is followed, it may give people more time to figure out other pathways to remain in the U.S. legally.",
      "He advises Venezuelans at risk of losing TPS to document everything they\u2019re doing while in the U.S., keep proof of the troubles they and their relatives have faced in Venezuela, explore other immigration pathways and make sure their applications are correctly submitted."

    "title": "The cost of weight loss drugs is finally dropping. How low can prices go?",
    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cost-weight-loss-drugs-wegovy-zepbound-how-low-prices-down-rcna205911",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are getting cheaper, if you are willing to pay out of pocket for the medications.",
    "story": [
      "The price of weight loss drugs is falling.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound, which both sell for a list price of more than $1,000 a month, have long been out of reach for people without insurance or whose insurance refused to cover them. Among adults who take the medications, about half say it\u2019s difficult to afford the cost, according to a May 2024 survey by the health policy group KFF.",
      "Over the past several months, however, drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have introduced lower-cost options. There are some caveats \u2014 people must pay out of pocket, or the medication is sold in a vial rather than a prefilled injector pen \u2014 but doctors and patients say the changes are long overdue.",
      "\u201cThe cost has come down significantly,\u201d said Dr. Peminda Cabandugama, an endocrinologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.",
      "Self-pay options",
      "In March, Novo Nordisk cut the price of all doses of Wegovy by 23% for people paying in cash, dropping it from $650 to $499 per month for uninsured patients or those without coverage. (The list price of $1,349 stayed the same.)",
      "It follows a similar move from Eli Lilly, which reduced Zepbound\u2019s starter dose to $349 and higher doses to $499 through its self-pay program, Lilly Direct. The discounted doses require patients to manually draw the medication from a vial with a syringe, adding an extra step compared to the prefilled injector pens.",
      "Experts point to several forces driving the falling prices: mounting pressure from the public and Congress on drugmakers\u2019 pricing practices; competition from pharmacies, med spas and weight loss clinics offering cheaper compounded versions of the drugs \u2014 although many of those are expected to be phased out this month; and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s recent approval of a generic version of Victoza, an older GLP-1 medication that can start at a cost of around $350 for a month\u2019s supply. The generic, called liraglutide, is taken daily, unlike Wegovy and Zepbound, which are taken weekly.",
      "Cabandugama said many of his patients typically paid around $1,500 a month out of pocket for brand names Wegovy and Zepbound, but in recent months they\u2019ve been able to get the same doses for around $400 a month or higher doses for around $500. Others switched from compounded versions to the brand-name drugs.",
      "\u201cA lot of patients were thinking, \u2018I\u2019m paying this amount for compounding. I couldn\u2019t make this switch to the standardized versions,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we have the brand-name version of it for around the same cost.\u201d",
      "Shakira Grant, 41, of North Carolina, started using Lilly\u2019s self-pay program for Zepbound earlier this month after a change in her insurance made her ineligible for the company\u2019s coupon savings card.",
      "Grant has been on a GLP-1 medication for three years \u2014 first Mounjaro, then Zepbound. (Both contain the same active ingredient tirzepatide.) She\u2019s now paying $499 a month after previously paying around $550 with the savings card.",
      "Without the self-pay program, Grant said she would have had to stop taking the medication because her insurance doesn\u2019t cover it, and she couldn\u2019t afford the more than $1,000 out-of-pocket cost.",
      "It\u2019s not the perfect solution, she said. Because Lilly doesn\u2019t offer all of its Zepbound doses through Lilly Direct, she\u2019s had to lower her dose from 15 milligrams to 10 mg. She has also found the process of drawing the medication up from a vial challenging\u00a0after years of using prefilled injector pens. She said she wishes it were cheaper but that she\u2019s willing to pay the price.",
      "\u201cIf there was not a backup option, I would have been left with a tough decision,\u201d Grant said. \u201cEither I tried to afford $1,000 per month or go without the drug cold turkey after being on it for three years.\u201d",
      "Expanded approvals",
      "Experts say that patients are beginning to pay less out of pocket not only because of the price drops, but also because of improved insurance coverage. The expanded approval of the drugs for conditions beyond diabetes and weight loss \u2014 including heart disease risk, for Wegovy, and obstructive sleep apnea, for Zepbound \u2014 has also persuaded more insurers to cover them, Cabandugama said.",
      "Elizabeth Kenly, 59, of Graham, North Carolina, said she asked her doctor this month to see if her insurance would cover Zepbound for sleep apnea.",
      "Kenly had been using a compounded version of Zepbound, paying around $600 a month. But if her insurance approves the brand name, her monthly cost could drop to as little as $25.",
      "\u201cThe savings, if covered by insurance, would be life-changing,\u201d Kenly said. \u201cI am still paying what is equivalent to a monthly care payment even with the compounded version.\u201d",
      "Dr. Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research at Weill Cornell Medicine, said he\u2019s even noticed in even recent months that pharmacies have started bringing down the prices of the weight loss drugs. Aronne serves as a chief medical adviser for Veru, a company developing an experimental weight loss drug, and was the principal investigator in a Lilly trial for tirzepatide.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve started to get really competitive,\u201d he said.",
      "Still a high cost",
      "Still, barriers remain: $400 to $500 is a significant amount of money for many people.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking $6,000 a year, and that is still probably more than insurers are paying right now\u201d with discounts, said Dr. David Rind, a primary care physician and the chief medical officer for the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review,\u202fa group that determines fair prices for drugs.",
      "\u201cIf insurance is relying on the fact that not covering it will allow people to buy it out of pocket, as a primary care doctor, I have a lot of concerns about that,\u201d Rind said.",
      "\u201cThese are actually great drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all my complaining about the price, these are drugs that we should want to give to lots of people, but it\u2019s been really hard to see how we can afford them.\u201d",
      "Rind said he doesn\u2019t expect prices to drop further anytime soon \u2014 not until other drugs in development are approved, which likely won\u2019t happen for a few more years.",
      "The introduction of lower-priced options and expanding insurance coverage aren\u2019t always a win for patients.",
      "Earlier this month, CVS Caremark announced that it will now cover Wegovy under its pharmacy benefit plans \u2014 but it will no longer cover Zepbound.",
      "A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine this month found Zepbound outperformed Wegovy in a head-to-head clinical trial.",
      "The move caused a stir on social media among people taking Zepbound who didn\u2019t want to switch to Wegovy.",
      "\u201cThis decision is purely based on economics, not clinical evidence, and it is not in the best interest of patients,\u201d said Dr. Christopher McGowan, who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, and is Grant\u2019s doctor.",
      "Disrupting a patient\u2019s treatment can have serious consequences, he added. They may regain weight, see a slowdown in their weight loss or develop new side effects.",
      "\u201cFor patients who have seen life-changing results with Zepbound, losing access can feel like a devastating loss, like losing a lifeline,\u201d McGowan said."

      "Southwest will continue to offer two free checked bags to Rapid Rewards A-List preferred members and customers traveling on Business Select fares, and one free checked bag to A-List members and other select customers. Passengers with Rapid Rewards credit cards will receive a credit for one checked bag.",
      "People who don\u2019t qualify for those categories will get charged to check bags. The airline said in March that it also would roll out a new, basic fare on its lowest priced tickets when the change takes effect.",
      "In September, the airline estimated that charging bag fees would bring in about $1.5 billion a year but cost the airline $1.8 billion in lost business from customers who chose to fly Southwest because of its generous baggage allowance.",
      "Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its new checked bag fees, but most major airlines typically charge between $35 and $40 for checked bags.",
      "Another policy that will take effect on Wednesday is Southwest requiring passengers to keep their portable chargers in plain sight while using them because of concerns about the growing number of lithium-ion battery fires.",
      "These aren\u2019t the only changes at Southwest. The Dallas airline previously announced that it was leaving behind another Southwest tradition, the open-boarding system it has used for more than 50 years. Southwest expects to begin operating flights with passengers in assigned seats next year.",
      "The airline also said last year that it would charge customers extra for more legroom and offer red-eye flights.",
      "Southwest has struggled recently and is under pressure from activist investors to boost profits and revenue. The airline reached a truce in October with hedge fund Elliott Investment Management to avoid a proxy fight, but Elliott won several seats on the company\u2019s board.",
      "The airline announced in February that it was eliminating 1,750 jobs, or 15% of its corporate workforce, in the first major layoffs in the company\u2019s 53-year history."

      "The swap came after four U.S. residents wrongly imprisoned in Russia \u2014 including journalist Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan \u2014 were released last August as part of a major multinational prisoner exchange the likes of which had not been seen since the Cold War.",

      "The future of international students at the oldest, richest and most renowned university in the U.S. is uncertain after the Trump administration announced a ban on their enrollment starting in the 2025-26 academic year.",
      "After Harvard refused to turn over extensive data about its international students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the school was being held accountable for \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\u201d",
      "Harvard has sued over the move, calling it unlawful, and on Friday a federal judge in Boston put it on hold for two weeks. If the Trump administration prevails, new international students would be barred from enrolling at Harvard while current ones would be forced to either transfer elsewhere or lose their legal status.",
      "U.S. universities including Harvard rely heavily on international students, who often pay far more in tuition than their American classmates. Many of them end up staying in the U.S., where they have been responsible for major breakthroughs in strategically important fields such as artificial intelligence where the U.S., China and other nations are locked in intense competition.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign against Harvard is a \u201cterrible policy error\u201d that could undermine the world-leading role the U.S. has played in research and development since World War II, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "A downturn in international students would affect American universities\u2019 \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d and income, while benefiting U.S. competitors, he said. \u201cChina will become significantly more attractive than before to students and researchers from the Global South,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWestern Europe will also gain significantly.\u201d",
      "There was already growing unease among international students at U.S. universities amid anti-immigrant rhetoric by Trump, in addition to deep funding cuts and efforts to intervene in universities\u2019 internal operations. Hundreds of students\u2019 visas have been revoked, while the Trump administration has detained and sought to deport others over pro-Palestinian and other activism.",
      "At Harvard, more than a quarter of the student body of about 25,000 comes from overseas and the looming ban has caught up students from more than 140 countries, including the future queen of Belgium.",
      "Harvard\u2019s biggest group of overseas students, about 20%, come from China, which was long the top source of international students in the U.S. before being overtaken by India last year.",
      "The number of Chinese students in the U.S. has been dropping \u2014to about 277,000 during the 2023-24 school year, compared with more than 372,000 in 2019-20 \u2014 due to disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic as well as growing U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Chinese academics were also driven away by the China Initiative, a national security program from Trump\u2019s first term that drew accusations of racial profiling. Many of them have moved their research to Chinese universities.",
      "Responding to the Harvard ban, Beijing said U.S.-China educational cooperation is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and that it would \u201csafeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars overseas.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina has consistently opposed the politicization of educational exchanges,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Friday. \u201cSuch actions by the U.S. will only damage its own image and international credibility.\u201d",

      "Duo Yi, who was admitted to the PhD Public Policy program at Harvard Kenny School, said she is now exploring other options amid growing uncertainty about her enrolment. Trump is \u201csimply too unpredictable,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no way of knowing what direction his future policies will take.\u201d",
      "Foreign governments and universities are not waiting to woo the Harvard students spurned by Trump. In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, officials have urged universities to take proactive action \u201cto attract top talent.\u201d",

And your whole shine is you\u2019re undefeated.\u201d",
      "Messina declined the job. And after Harris\u2019 loss to Donald Trump, it may not have been a bad move.",
      "David Plouffe, long hailed as the brilliant architect of Obama\u2019s 2008 victory, served in a key role in Harris\u2019 campaign and is now among those tagged with a devastating defeat.",
      "\u201cThe shine\u2019s off Plouffe now. He was the golden boy,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cNow he\u2019s just an old broken-down boy, who lost. Big.\u201d",
      "Messina did not comment on the exchange. Plouffe did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "While many Democrats still admire Plouffe\u2019s successes, the harsh words punctuated a growing sentiment across a party searching for a path forward: Team Obama\u2019s bloom may be falling off the rose.",
      "More Democrats are openly criticizing Obama strategists and consultants, who were long treated as the high priests of their party\u2019s politics. Democratic National Committee officials at a news event last month blamed Obama\u2019s lack of investment in state parties over his two terms for setting back local organizing, with the party still feeling the effects. The so-called Obama coalition of voters \u2014 less politically engaged voters, younger voters and voters of color \u2014 is no more. In 2024, each of those groups shifted toward Trump in high numbers.",
      "Going forward, it could mark a clean slate for a party whose course for nearly two decades cascaded from decisions Obama had made. It was Obama who chose Biden as his vice president, offering him the elevated perch that set up his 2020 election and his aborted 2024 re-election. Obama selected Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state, then anointed her for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race against Trump. The operatives Obama and his top aides empowered have carved out leading, decision-making roles at the top of the Democratic Party since then.",
      "But after 2024, more Democrats want to see that change.",
      "Obama himself remains a force in the party, filling stadiums and commanding the attention of major donors. Indeed, the DNC is in talks with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to host Obama for a fundraiser at his home, according to two people with knowledge of the planning, which is still in its early stages.",
      "But even the former president\u2019s luster was showing signs of fading last fall, a phenomenon that threatens to persist as the next crop of young voters ages into adulthood. When the 2028 presidential election arrives, it will be 20 years since Obama\u2019s first victory. At that point, more voters will have come of age in the era of Donald Trump than in the era of Obama.",
      "\u201cOne of the challenges the Democratic Party does have is that there is nostalgia for the Obama era, both in terms of Barack Obama being in the White House and what that meant for the country and the style of leadership that we have, but also like the style of our politics,\u201d Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a de-evolution of our politics over the last 10 years, and it\u2019s just a very different era.\u201d",
      "Criticism flying within the party",
      "Democrats point to myriad factors leading to Harris\u2019 defeat in 2024 \u2014 with many focusing on a compressed timeline because Biden refused to step aside as the party\u2019s candidate until 107 days before the election. Plouffe pointedly blamed Biden, saying \u201cHe totally f---ed us\u201d in a newly released book.",
      "Plouffe\u2019s verbal affront opened him and fellow Obama alums to their own criticisms. DNC Finance Chair Chris Korge lashed out at Plouffe in an interview with NBC News last week, saying he and other Obama alums shared the blame, chiding them as the \u201cso-called gurus.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to re-evaluate the use of consultants and bring in new forward-looking people,\u201d Korge also said in the interview. \u201cThe old Obama playbook no longer works.\u201d",
      "Jane Kleeb \u2014 the Nebraska Democratic Party chair, a DNC vice chair and the president of a national group of state party chairs \u2014 said Democrats need to get back to the basics of investing in and listening to local stakeholders and organizers. She said this realization crystalized during the recent Omaha mayoral election, when Republicans attacked the Democratic candidate on transgender issues. She said the party \u201cscrewed up\u201d in 2024 by not pushing back on those attacks on candidates up and down the ticket.",
      "This time, she said, she knew whom to get into a room to tackle the issue.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t contact the Pod Save America guys or a New York press firm to say, \u2018How do I handle this?\u2019\u201d Kleeb said. \u201cOur team literally got into the conference room at our state party office and said, \u2018Let\u2019s throw out ideas on how we can push back on this, because we\u2019re not going to let them take down John Ewing on this bulls--- again.\u2019\u201d",
      "They went basic, flipping the script in a new ad: Mayor Jean Stothert was \u201cfocused on potties;\u201d Democratic candidate Ewing was \u201cfocused on fixing potholes.\u201d Ewing ended up ousting the longtime incumbent by nearly 13 points, after Stothert had trounced her past opponents.",
      "\u201cAnd that resonated with voters,\u201d Kleeb said, adding: \u201cThe reality for state parties on the ground is we don\u2019t give a s--- about what camp a political consultant cut their teeth in.\u201d",
      "As far as she\u2019s concerned, she said, she welcomes any and all Democrats \u2014 those who worked for any Democratic president and beyond \u2014\u00a0to be in the room.",
      "\u201cOur party is looking at these philosophical questions and missing the point that we need to trust the people in the states who are on the ground, who are constantly in touch with voters, and just let this intraparty fighting and whose camp is better \u2014 let it go,\u201d Kleeb said. \u201cI want them all at the table.\u201d",
      "Other Democrats echoed the sentiment. One longtime Biden ally, Steve Schale, who also worked on Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, specifically defended Plouffe\u2019s contributions to the party.",
      "\u201cDavid is one of the sharpest guys around. I was grateful he stepped up and joined the campaign, and anyone who thinks his voice isn\u2019t needed, quite frankly, is an idiot,\u201d Schale said. \u201cDavid has also been clear-eyed about what we need to do going forward \u2026 He\u2019s done enough in his life that he has earned the right to take his ball and go home, but for one, I am glad he remains engaged.\u201d",

      "\u201cMost of these same consultants have locked in these candidates before they ever announce, and so there\u2019s never any opportunity for any new blood to be a part of these campaigns,\u201d said Rocha, who helped freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., win his seat in 2024.",
      "He said the firms rise and fall, but the players who run them are the same \u2014 a sort of regeneration cycle that keeps the same people in place. \u201cThey\u2019re all connected,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2024, Biden-Harris campaign chief Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon tapped fellow Obama alumni for major roles. For example, Stephanie Cutter, managing partner of O\u2019Malley Dillon\u2019s old firm, Precision Strategies, was picked to help run the Democratic convention program and prep Harris for media interviews. 270 Strategies founding partner Mitch Stewart, who managed battleground states for Obama, was brought on to oversee a similar program for Biden. Rufus Gifford, the big-donor wrangler for Obama, acted as director of fundraising for the Biden campaign. The list goes on.",
      "Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist with experience on past presidential campaigns, said it\u2019s time for the party to take a hard look at the same set of operatives, including Obama campaign alums, who have been running national Democratic campaigns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I don\u2019t want a surgeon who keeps killing patients,\u201d he said.",
      "Some victories, he noted, are a reflection of the skills of the candidate, rather than the operatives around them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to win with a guy like Obama,\u201d Kofinis said, adding that Democrats tend to put too much emphasis on experience when they hire operatives, rather than \u201cwhether they\u2019re any good\u201d at their jobs.",
      "Activist and DNC vice chair David Hogg said that just as some elected Democrats cling to power for too long, so too does the party\u2019s operative class.",
      "He sees an anti-establishment fervor that began with Obama and continues to this day, where candidates who are perceived to be going against the system will be more successful than those who pledge to uphold or defend it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine this now, because Obama is such a major figurehead, obviously he\u2019s seen as part of the system, but when he ran, he ran, I would argue, as an anti-establishment candidate,\u201d said Hogg, who has faced pushback for holding a DNC position while also advocating for primary challenges against some party incumbents. Aside from a unique, Covid-fueled election in 2020, he continued, \u201cthe challenge is, we are still in a moment where anti system candidates are going to be favored.\u201d",
      "What's next for Democrats",
      "But with political operatives who cut their teeth in the Obama years still wielding power in the party, there\u2019s a disconnect between the leadership and younger electorates the party needs to win moving forward, Hogg added. Part of the issue is that those young voters barely have any memory of the nation\u2019s first Black president.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they have one to be honest with you. That\u2019s part of the challenge,\u201d Hogg, 25, said, adding, \u201cFor many of these younger people who are under the age of 20, right now \u2026 they don\u2019t remember much of what Obama talked about. They grew up in the political context of Donald Trump and him being normalized, because that was what politics was to them growing up.\u201d",
      "Ammar Moussa, a campaign aide to both Biden and Harris, noted that a natural changing of the guard is likely already underway. For starters, many of the governors filling up the short-list of leading contenders for the party\u2019s 2028 nomination have their own longtime political hands, some of them incubated far from Democratic Party headquarters in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe should always think about how we are elevating operatives and promoting their staff who understand the landscape and what it takes to win campaigns in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, because every cycle is different,\u201d Moussa said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon candidates and senior staffers and the senior consulting class to know what they don\u2019t know.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cost-weight-loss-drugs-wegovy-zepbound-how-low-prices-down-rcna205911",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are getting cheaper, if you are willing to pay out of pocket for the medications.",
    "story": [
      "The price of weight loss drugs is falling.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound, which both sell for a list price of more than $1,000 a month, have long been out of reach for people without insurance or whose insurance refused to cover them. Among adults who take the medications, about half say it\u2019s difficult to afford the cost, according to a May 2024 survey by the health policy group KFF.",
      "Over the past several months, however, drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have introduced lower-cost options. There are some caveats \u2014 people must pay out of pocket, or the medication is sold in a vial rather than a prefilled injector pen \u2014 but doctors and patients say the changes are long overdue.",
      "\u201cThe cost has come down significantly,\u201d said Dr. Peminda Cabandugama, an endocrinologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.",
      "Self-pay options",
      "In March, Novo Nordisk cut the price of all doses of Wegovy by 23% for people paying in cash, dropping it from $650 to $499 per month for uninsured patients or those without coverage. (The list price of $1,349 stayed the same.)",
      "It follows a similar move from Eli Lilly, which reduced Zepbound\u2019s starter dose to $349 and higher doses to $499 through its self-pay program, Lilly Direct. The discounted doses require patients to manually draw the medication from a vial with a syringe, adding an extra step compared to the prefilled injector pens.",
      "Experts point to several forces driving the falling prices: mounting pressure from the public and Congress on drugmakers\u2019 pricing practices; competition from pharmacies, med spas and weight loss clinics offering cheaper compounded versions of the drugs \u2014 although many of those are expected to be phased out this month; and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s recent approval of a generic version of Victoza, an older GLP-1 medication that can start at a cost of around $350 for a month\u2019s supply. The generic, called liraglutide, is taken daily, unlike Wegovy and Zepbound, which are taken weekly.",
      "Cabandugama said many of his patients typically paid around $1,500 a month out of pocket for brand names Wegovy and Zepbound, but in recent months they\u2019ve been able to get the same doses for around $400 a month or higher doses for around $500. Others switched from compounded versions to the brand-name drugs.",
      "\u201cA lot of patients were thinking, \u2018I\u2019m paying this amount for compounding. I couldn\u2019t make this switch to the standardized versions,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we have the brand-name version of it for around the same cost.\u201d",
      "Shakira Grant, 41, of North Carolina, started using Lilly\u2019s self-pay program for Zepbound earlier this month after a change in her insurance made her ineligible for the company\u2019s coupon savings card.",
      "Grant has been on a GLP-1 medication for three years \u2014 first Mounjaro, then Zepbound. (Both contain the same active ingredient tirzepatide.) She\u2019s now paying $499 a month after previously paying around $550 with the savings card.",
      "Without the self-pay program, Grant said she would have had to stop taking the medication because her insurance doesn\u2019t cover it, and she couldn\u2019t afford the more than $1,000 out-of-pocket cost.",
      "It\u2019s not the perfect solution, she said. Because Lilly doesn\u2019t offer all of its Zepbound doses through Lilly Direct, she\u2019s had to lower her dose from 15 milligrams to 10 mg. She has also found the process of drawing the medication up from a vial challenging\u00a0after years of using prefilled injector pens. She said she wishes it were cheaper but that she\u2019s willing to pay the price.",
      "\u201cIf there was not a backup option, I would have been left with a tough decision,\u201d Grant said. \u201cEither I tried to afford $1,000 per month or go without the drug cold turkey after being on it for three years.\u201d",
      "Expanded approvals",
      "Experts say that patients are beginning to pay less out of pocket not only because of the price drops, but also because of improved insurance coverage. The expanded approval of the drugs for conditions beyond diabetes and weight loss \u2014 including heart disease risk, for Wegovy, and obstructive sleep apnea, for Zepbound \u2014 has also persuaded more insurers to cover them, Cabandugama said.",
      "Elizabeth Kenly, 59, of Graham, North Carolina, said she asked her doctor this month to see if her insurance would cover Zepbound for sleep apnea.",
      "Kenly had been using a compounded version of Zepbound, paying around $600 a month. But if her insurance approves the brand name, her monthly cost could drop to as little as $25.",
      "\u201cThe savings, if covered by insurance, would be life-changing,\u201d Kenly said. \u201cI am still paying what is equivalent to a monthly care payment even with the compounded version.\u201d",
      "Dr. Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research at Weill Cornell Medicine, said he\u2019s even noticed in even recent months that pharmacies have started bringing down the prices of the weight loss drugs. Aronne serves as a chief medical adviser for Veru, a company developing an experimental weight loss drug, and was the principal investigator in a Lilly trial for tirzepatide.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve started to get really competitive,\u201d he said.",
      "Still a high cost",
      "Still, barriers remain: $400 to $500 is a significant amount of money for many people.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking $6,000 a year, and that is still probably more than insurers are paying right now\u201d with discounts, said Dr. David Rind, a primary care physician and the chief medical officer for the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review,\u202fa group that determines fair prices for drugs.",
      "\u201cIf insurance is relying on the fact that not covering it will allow people to buy it out of pocket, as a primary care doctor, I have a lot of concerns about that,\u201d Rind said.",
      "\u201cThese are actually great drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all my complaining about the price, these are drugs that we should want to give to lots of people, but it\u2019s been really hard to see how we can afford them.\u201d",
      "Rind said he doesn\u2019t expect prices to drop further anytime soon \u2014 not until other drugs in development are approved, which likely won\u2019t happen for a few more years.",
      "The introduction of lower-priced options and expanding insurance coverage aren\u2019t always a win for patients.",
      "Earlier this month, CVS Caremark announced that it will now cover Wegovy under its pharmacy benefit plans \u2014 but it will no longer cover Zepbound.",
      "A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine this month found Zepbound outperformed Wegovy in a head-to-head clinical trial.",
      "The move caused a stir on social media among people taking Zepbound who didn\u2019t want to switch to Wegovy.",
      "\u201cThis decision is purely based on economics, not clinical evidence, and it is not in the best interest of patients,\u201d said Dr. Christopher McGowan, who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, and is Grant\u2019s doctor.",
      "Disrupting a patient\u2019s treatment can have serious consequences, he added. They may regain weight, see a slowdown in their weight loss or develop new side effects.",
      "\u201cFor patients who have seen life-changing results with Zepbound, losing access can feel like a devastating loss, like losing a lifeline,\u201d McGowan said."

    "summary": "A Supreme Court order that provided more questions than answers is jeopardizing the legal immigration status of Venezuelans with TPS.",
    "story": [
      "A 10-year-old Venezuelan girl living in New York City with a special legal protection against deportation has repeatedly asked her mother the same question all week: \u201cMommy, what am I going to do if immigration comes?\u201d",
      "The girl, her two siblings and her parents are among the 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants who have been living and working in the U.S. with temporary protected status, better known as TPS, for the past two years.",
      "But a one-page Supreme Court order issued last week, which provided more questions than answers, jeopardized the legal immigration status of Venezuelans with TPS \u2014 eliciting uncertainty, anguish and a sense of betrayal for families at risk of losing their protections.",
      "\u201cThat makes you feel very depressed, anxious and distressed,\u201d the mother of the little girl told NBC News in her native Spanish. \u201cThis is all terrible.\u201d",
      "With no clear timeline, the Supreme Court gave President Donald Trump and his administration the green light to continue their efforts to end the protections granted to these Venezuelans in 2023 by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "NBC News spoke with the mother in New York City and two other Venezuelan TPS holders, one in North Carolina and one in Los Angeles, about navigating changing immigration policies at a time when the Trump administration is rolling back temporary protections and other legal immigration programs for refugees and asylum-seekers \u2014 consequently expanding the pool of possible deportees as the president seeks to deliver on his campaign promise of mass deportations.",
      "All three TPS holders requested their names not be published for safety reasons, as they expressed worries about their protections against deportation under TPS.",
      "TPS is considered a humanitarian designation under U.S. law for nationals of certain countries experiencing war, natural disasters or other serious crises that would make it unsafe for them to return.",
      "Beneficiaries are allowed to remain in the U.S. legally and get work authorization for up to 18 months \u2014 subject to extensions.",
      "That is the case for a young political scientist who fled government persecution in her native Venezuela to settle in North Carolina. She has TPS and was overcome with frustration after she saw the Supreme Court\u2019s order Monday, she said.",
      "\u201cBeing in that limbo feels like a right that you already acquired has been taken away from you,\u201d she said, adding that TPS holders like her did everything right to meet requirements and paid hundreds of dollars in work permits and application fees.",
      "'Still searching for a better future'",
      "Affected TPS holders are part of one of the world\u2019s largest migration crises. Over 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland over the past decade \u2014 escaping rampant violence, inflation, organized crime and political repression from a regime accused of repeatedly violating human rights, as well as shortages of food and medicine and a lack of essential services such as electricity and health care.",
      "After being persecuted for the nature of her work, the political scientist arrived to the U.S. in 2022 on a visa. Applying for and receiving TPS under the 2023 designation gave her much-needed \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d she said. That meant, \u201cI\u2019m in a safe place and I\u2019m legally here.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes everything in your daily life,\u201d she said, adding the protections helped her shed the fears of persecution and human rights violations she faced in Venezuela and start a new chapter, personally and professionally.",
      "Biden had extended TPS until October 2026 before leaving office. But the Department of Homeland Security rescinded that extension shortly after Trump took office, moving to end the program for Venezuelans under the 2023 TPS designation. Litigation is underway to determine whether the program stays until next year or ends earlier.",
      "But what happens in the meantime? This is the nerve-racking question that has been circling in the mind of the Venezuelan mother in New York City all week. All five members of her family obtained TPS under the 2023 designation for Venezuelan nationals.",
      "The mother said her husband, who has been recovering from an accident that injured his back, did not go to his follow-up appointments this week. Her three daughters attended their last week of school with renewed fears that they or their parents could be detained and deported.",
      "Since having TPS, the mother landed a \u201cdecent job caring for elders\u201d that allowed her to provide for her family and open a bank account to move toward a financially stable future, she said, adding that her family consistently complies with immigration appointments and requirements.",
      "Because of this, she sees the Trump administration\u2019s insistence on ending TPS for Venezuelans like her as unfair, she said.",
      "The family not only fears the prospect of losing deportation protections and employment authorization if TPS ends, but also worries about \u201cbeing denigrated and facing xenophobia again\u201d in their everyday life following the Supreme Court order, the mother said.",
      "From walking through the jungle to enduring cold temperatures and hunger on their trek to the U.S., she said she found herself reflecting back on everything her family has done \u201cto reach a country where one is still searching for a better future.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s why Niurka Mel\u00e9ndez, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker and the director and founder of Venezuelans and Immigrants Aid in New York City, has been leading volunteer and grassroots efforts to ensure her community is not \u201cparalyzed by fear,\u201d helping people seek trustworthy information and available legal resources.",
      "'I feel betrayed'",
      "From making deliveries to working in a labor organization, another Venezuelan mother with TPS in Los Angeles works multiple jobs to support herself and her family in Venezuela.",
      "She said the crisis in her homeland is so bad that her 30-year-old daughter, a dentist in Venezuela, can\u2019t make ends meet. She sends money to help her and her aging parents survive and get basic goods they may not have due to shortages.",
      "For her, returning to Venezuela would not just mean going back to a homeland riddled with ailments. It would also mean that her family in Venezuela would lose a source of financial support they depend on, said the TPS-holding woman in Los Angeles.",
      "She, like many other Venezuelans, had believed Trump had what it took to stand against the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela and pave the way for the possible return of those who have fled.",
      "\u201cBut I was wrong,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "DHS said in a February memo announcing its intention to end TPS for Venezuelans under the 2023 designation that Venezuela has seen \u201cnotable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.\u201d",
      "The mother in Los Angeles said she knows that\u2019s not true based on her conversations with relatives in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cNow, I feel betrayed,\u201d she added.",
      "In New York, immigration attorney Edward Cuccia was flooded with calls from hundreds of his TPS clients last week as they try to determine what to do next.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a vast number of people who ran away from a terrible situation down in Venezuela, which has not gotten any better,\u201d Cuccia said. \u201cTheir status is all in limbo.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration may attempt to strip protections from these Venezuelans to have them ready for expedited removal, Cuccia said. But if due process is followed, it may give people more time to figure out other pathways to remain in the U.S. legally.",
      "He advises Venezuelans at risk of losing TPS to document everything they\u2019re doing while in the U.S., keep proof of the troubles they and their relatives have faced in Venezuela, explore other immigration pathways and make sure their applications are correctly submitted."

We have a fire investigator on scene, as well.\u201d",
      "Footage from a surveillance camera captured the moment the fireball erupted on the boat, and showed multiple people spilling into the water.",

      "The Texas Department of Public Safety arrested the two men in Walker County, north of Houston, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office said in a statement.",
      "Separately, Lenton Vanburen, 26, who was jailed on firearms and parole violation charges, was taken into custody in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the city\u2019s police department said in a statement.",
      "The three inmates will face additional charges, Murrill said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether they have lawyers to speak on their behalf.",
      "Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian Fair attributed the capture of Donald and Tate to a dayslong, multi-agency effort that tracked the pair to the Houston metro area. He said the U.S. Marshals Office for the Southern District of Texas responded after being forwarded a \"collateral lead.\"",
      "The suspects were taken into custody during a traffic stop, he said.",
      "Fair described the remaining two inmates who have not been captured as \"extremely dangerous\" and said they could be anywhere.",
      "\"Both of them and other of the people on the run have had a support network in the New Orleans area, but they could be outside of the New Orleans area,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to take a lot more work to figure out where they are exactly.\"",
      "One of the men, Derrick Groves, was convicted of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder last October.",
      "Several people, including a jail maintenance worker, have been accused of assisting in the escape.",
      "Sterling Williams, who was charged with principle to simple escape and malfeasance in office, cut off the water to a cell's toilet so inmates could remove it without flooding the area, Murrill alleged in a news release last week.",
      "According to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant, Williams told authorities that one of the inmates who escaped threatened to \u201cshank\u201d him if he did not help.",
      "That inmate, identified in the document as Antoine Massey, has not been apprehended.",
      "Williams' lawyer disputed the affidavit, saying his client was unaware of the inmates' escape plan. Williams turned off the water, the attorney told the Associated Press, to help fix a clogged toilet.",
      "After the men removed the toilet, the affidavit alleges, the inmates sawed through steel bars and escaped through a hole in the wall before they scaled a barbed-wire fence using blankets.",
      "A photo released by authorities showed the phrases \u201cTo Easy Lol\u201d and \u201cWe Innocent\u201d written above the toilet."

      "A Florida man who was apparently bitten while swimming in alligator-infested waters Monday morning was fatally shot after, officials said, he emerged from the lake and charged at sheriff's deputies with garden shears.",
      "Two deputies, including a trainee, opened fire on Timothy Schulz, 42, after they deployed a stun gun that appeared to have no effect and after Schulz tried to remove a firearm from their patrol cruiser, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told reporters.",
      "\u201cThe fact that he was bitten by an alligator and still continued his rampage is shocking,\u201d Judd said.",
      "Authorities first responded to a call involving Schulz at 5:56 a.m., when he appeared at a racetrack shaking and asking to call his son, Judd said. Deputies who responded to the area could not find him, the sheriff said.",
      "Nearly two hours later, a witness spotted Schulz in Lakeland, south of Orlando, and reported that the man was in a lake with \u201ca lot\u201d of alligators, Judd said.",

      "The witnesses reported that Schulz was treading water and that they could see only his head. At one point, an alligator appeared to bite his right arm, Judd said.",
      "After he emerged from the lake, Schulz was seen walking between houses in a residential area, carrying a pair of garden shears. At one point he threw a brick at a truck, Judd said.",
      "As deputies arrived, Judd said, they saw Schulz apparently trying to break into a vehicle and quickly got out of their cruiser.",
      "When Schulz charged at them with the shears, Judd said, they ordered him to drop the tool, then deployed the stun gun when he did not.",
      "Schulz climbed into the passenger side of the deputies' patrol vehicle and appeared to try and remove a rifle or shotgun, Judd said.",
      "\"At that time our deputies shot multiple times,\" Judd said. \"As a result, Timothy is deceased.\"",
      "He said the deputies will remain on administrative leave while the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office reviews the shooting, per department policy.",
      "Judd said Schulz has faced several methamphetamine charges and was released from county jail most recently on May 20. An affidavit in that case says a deputy found a glass pipe in a backpack Schulz was carrying that tested positive for the drug."

      "Harvard University revoked the tenure of Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino after years of data fraud allegations, a university spokesperson confirmed.",
      "Gino, widely known for researching honesty and ethical behavior, was placed on administrative leave in 2023 after multiple allegations of falsifying data surfaced.",
      "A spokesperson for Harvard provided no additional details, noting that it does not discuss personnel matters. Gino also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "No professors are known to have lost their tenure at Harvard since the 1940s, when the American Association of University Professors formalized rules of termination, according to The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper.",
      "Gino started working at Harvard Business School in 2010 as an associate professor of business administration, according to her extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9, updated in June 2023. From 2018 to 2021, she was the head of the Negotiations, Organizations and Markets Unit.",
      "Gino\u2019s research has been widely featured in the media, such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and NBC News.",
      "In 2021, three professors and behavioral researchers with a blog site, Data Colada, began examining a number of studies Gino co-authored over a decade and shared evidence they believed proved fraudulent data with the business school.",
      "According to a 2023 blog post in which the researchers posted their evidence, the rest of their interactions with the university after they shared their 2021 report were confidential.",

      "\"Once I have the opportunity to prove this in the court of law, with the support of experts I was denied through Harvard\u2019s investigation process, you\u2019ll see why their case is so weak and that these are bogus allegations,\" the statement continued."

    "summary": "Federal policy prevents around 50,000 injured veterans from receiving both their full retirement pay and disability compensation.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When Army veteran Dan Nevins was forced to medically retire from the military after losing both his legs in combat, he thought he\u2019d be financially taken care of by the country that he served.",
      "But Nevins soon discovered the so-called \u201cwounded veterans tax\u201d \u2014 an unofficial term for a federal policy that prohibits certain injured veterans from receiving both their full retirement pay and disability compensation.",
      "\u201cI was told I could not receive both,\u201d Nevins told NBC News in an interview. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Wait a minute. That\u2019s not what I thought was going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an issue that affects around 50,000 veterans, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, costing them each about $1,900 per month.",
      "Under current federal policy, veterans who have less than 20 years of service and a disability rating under 50% get a dollar taken out of their retirement for every dollar they receive in disability compensation. The disability rating is assigned by the Veterans Affairs Department and assesses how much an injury or disability may impact a veteran\u2019s health and ability to function.",
      "And now, Nevins is pushing lawmakers in Washington to change that.",
      "In 2004, when Nevins was deployed to Iraq as a squad leader, an improvised explosive device detonated beneath his vehicle. The blast killed his platoon sergeant, and eventually both of Nevins legs would be amputated below the knee because of the injuries he sustained.",
      "\u201cPeople say when you\u2019re about to die your life flashes before your eyes. That wasn\u2019t really my experience. It was more like a slideshow of things left undone,\u201d said Nevins, who still wears a bracelet every day to honor his platoon sergeant.",
      "\u201cThe last sort of vision, it was my 10-year-old daughter, but she was all grown up and dressed in white head to toe, and walking down the aisle without her dad. And I was like, \u2018I\u2019m alive. I have to do something to keep it that way.\u2019\u201d",
      "After a painful and lengthy recovery process, which included 36 surgeries and an 18-month stay at Walter Reed Hospital, Nevins started to live his life again. That included learning some new skills, such as becoming a certified yoga instructor.",
      "But because of his injuries, Nevins left the military earlier than anticipated. That is when, to his surprise, Nevins learned that he would not be receiving his full retirement pay.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy really,\u201d Nevins said. \u201cSo many people are cutting what we would all take for granted out of their lives, just so they can survive. And I mean, it\u2019s not a ton of money, but it will help and really change lives and families for the better.\u201d",
      "Congress is making a renewed push to eliminate the offset with a bipartisan bill, dubbed the Major Richard Star Act, that would give wounded veterans their full retirement benefits and disability pay.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., is spearheading the effort in the Senate, where it has 71 co-sponsors, while Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., is leading the bill in the House, where it has 274 co-sponsors.",
      "\u201cVeterans are retired early because of the wounds and the injuries they receive, and they\u2019re entitled to disability compensation for them, but then their retirement pay is reduced dollar for dollar because of that disability compensation,\u201d Blumenthal told NBC News. \u201cThey\u2019re being penalized for being wounded. ... It\u2019s about simple justice and fairness.\u201d",
      "But the bill is costly: The CBO estimated in 2022 that the legislation would have cost $9.75 billion from 2024 to 2033. And at a time when the Trump administration is looking to trim government spending \u2014 including at the Veterans Affairs Department \u2014 cost concerns could stand in the way of passage.",
      "A spokesman for the VA said it does not typically comment on pending legislation, but vowed that no health care or benefits for veterans will be cut. The Department of Defense did not return a request for comment.",
      "Blumenthal said he sees \u201ca number of paths\u201d for the bill. He plans to offer it as an amendment to an annual defense policy bill later this year. And in the coming weeks, Blumenthal is going to try to bring it up under unanimous consent and \u201csee who has the nerve to come forward and say we should deny our veterans basic fairness.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Memorial Day, Nevins traveled to Washington to advocate for the bill. He appeared at a press conference alongside Marine Corps veteran Jamel Daniels, who also lost his leg in combat. The two got to know each other during their respective recoveries and even did wheelchair races in the hospital hallways, according to Nevins.",
      "Now, Nevins and Daniels are fighting for a legislative fix in the halls of the Capitol. And Nevins says his message to Congress is simple: honor the country\u2019s commitment to veterans.",
      "\u201cWe should keep our promises,\u201d Nevins said. \u201cI teach my kids to keep their promises, even when it\u2019s not convenient for them.\u201d"

      "Last week, the \"Piano Man\" revealed that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus, a form of reversible dementia, and would be canceling his upcoming U.S. tour dates.",
      "On May 26, Billy Joel's wife took to social media to thank fans for their support.",
      "\u201cThank you for the outpouring of love and support. We are so grateful for the wonderful care and swift diagnosis we received. Bill is beloved by so many, and to us, he is a father and husband who is at the center of our world,\" Alexis Roderick Joel wrote in the caption of an Instagram post on his account.",
      "\"We are hopeful for his recovery. We look forward to seeing you all in the future,\" she continued.",
      "Along with the update, Alexis Roderick Joel shared a photo of herself with Billy Joel and their daughters, Della Rose and Remy.",
      "Billy Joel initially postponed tour dates in March \u201cdue to a medical condition,\" according to his website, which prompted questions about the singer's health.",
      "On May 23, Billy Joel announced in a statement on social media that he was recently diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus and would be canceling all of his scheduled concert dates.",
      "According to the statement, the singer's condition has been worsened by recent performances, leading to problems with his hearing, vision and balance. As directed by his doctor, Billy Joel is doing physical therapy and refraining from performing while he recovers.",
      "Alexis Roderick Joel said the family is \"hopeful\" for his recovery from the disorder.",
      "In addition to his wife, Billy Joel also has the support of his ex Christie Brinkley and their daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, who posted heartfelt tributes to him on social media over the weekend.",

      "What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?",
      "NPH is a rare, but reversible, type of dementia. It occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull and puts pressure on the brain, per the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The increase in pressure can affect brain functioning and cause problems with thinking, short-term memory, communication and movement. Symptoms include unsteady gait, trouble walking, balance issues, urinary incontinence, confusion, forgetfulness and moodiness, TODAY.com previously reported.",
      "These can mimic the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Parkinson's disease, and NPH is often misdiagnosed. NPH is most common in people over the age of 65.",
      "Unlike most other forms of dementia, which are progressive and irreversible, NPH may be controlled or reversed with proper treatment. Doctors may perform a spinal tap to temporarily remove excess fluid, or surgery to implant a shunt in the brain, which allows fluid to drain into the stomach, TODAY.com previously reported. This resolves symptoms for many NPH patients.",
      "As of May 26, Billy Joel has not released any further details about specific treatments.",
      "Billy Joel's latest diagnosis isn't the only health hurdle the singer has faced during his long career.",
      "In recent years, Billy Joel battled a viral infection that forced him to take vocal rest and had a back surgery, which led him to lose 50 pounds. Previously, the singer has suffered from mental health issues and sought treatment for alcohol abuse."

      "But it\u2019s this final episode of Season 2 that truly shatters everything: It\u2019s Day 3 in Seattle, and Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and Jesse (Young Mazino) ride to the rescue of Ellie and Dina, who\u2019s recovering from a crossbow arrow injury. Ellie, shaken by what she did to the WLF pack members (one who Ellie accidentally shot was pregnant), agrees to leave town and live without taking down Abby \u2014 until Abby tracks them down at a theater where they\u2019ve been hanging out. Abby kills Jesse and injures Tommy, then takes aim at Ellie, who insists that she\u2019s the one Abby wants, not Tommy.",
      "\u201cI let you live,\u201d Abby tells Ellie. \u201cAnd you wasted it.\u201d We hear a gunshot \u2014 and the screen goes to black.",
      "But the episode doesn\u2019t end there: We flash back to Day 1 in Seattle. Abby is awoken for a meeting and goes out onto a balcony, looking down into a sports stadium (likely Lumen Field) at a combination community/military base before she heads off to a meeting.",
      "Does Ellie die in \u2018The Last of Us\u2019 video game?",
      "Short answer: No. Ellie lives, but is left scarred physically and mentally, and ultimately appears to lose everything she once valued.",
      "Longer answer: Season 2 of \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d actually already showed us how the game \u201cThe Last of Us Part II\u201d ended \u2014 with Ellie\u2019s memory of speaking to Joel on his front porch, and her saying she\u2019d like to try and forgive him for what he did at that hospital. This only comes after the main gameplay has ended.",
      "So what does happen to Ellie in the video game?",
      "\ud83d\udea8 There\u2019s at least one more season in the works for this HBO series, so avoid the following if you don\u2019t want to be spoiled.",
      "Season 2 of the series seems to be leaving audiences off toward the end of \u201cPart II,\u201d in which Abby has more connections to the Seraphite cult, and betrays WLF to save one member of that cult. When she finds some of the WLF members dead thanks to Ellie, she tracks her down to the hideout and shoots Tommy, then beats up Ellie and Dina \u2014 but ultimately spares them.",
      "But that\u2019s not the end of \u201cPart II\u201d \u2014 after that beating, there\u2019s a time jump in which Ellie and Dina live on a farm, raising Dina and Jesse\u2019s son. Tommy tells them where Abby is these days, and Ellie goes out on one final mission. They get into a fight, and Abby takes off two of Ellie\u2019s fingers. Ellie nearly drowns Abby, but thinks of Joel \u2014 and spares her. When Ellie returns to the farmhouse, it\u2019s empty, and she again thinks of Joel and how he saved her life back at the Salt Lake City hospital.",
      "Who\u2019s dead and who\u2019s still alive by the end of Season 2?",
      "There are a lot of deaths in Season 2, especially after the cordyceps zombies storm the fort. But focusing on the most important characters, the dead include Joel and Jesse; plus WLF crew members Nora (Tati Gabrielle), Manny (Danny Ramirez), Owen (Spencer Lord) and Mel (Ariela Barer).",
      "Ellie is almost certainly not dead, all evidence and screen-cuts to the contrary. Probably neither is Abby. They still have final reckonings with one another yet to accomplish, according to the video game. Meanwhile, Dina is pregnant and injured, but should survive. We also finally saw the importance of Eugene\u2019s (Joe Pantoliano) exit, and how it led to a massive break between Ellie and Joel.",
      "Most everyone else you can think of lives \u2026 at least for now."

    "summary": "Robyn Hurder, Caroline Bowman and choreographer Joshua Bergasse discuss the Broadway production of \"Smash\" and how it was inspired by the 2012 NBC drama.",
    "story": [
      "When Robyn Hurder takes the stage in Broadway\u2019s \u201cSmash,\u201d she portrays the dream role of Marilyn Monroe \u2014 sort of.",
      "In the Broadway production inspired by the 2012 NBC drama of the same name, Hurder plays Ivy Lynn, a musical theater darling tackling the role of a lifetime in the fictional show \u201cBombshell.\u201d Ivy is introduced as a beloved leader of the still developing production, fostering friendly rapport with everyone from her understudy, Karen (Caroline Bowman), to director Nigel (Brooks Ashmanskas). But as the pressure of portraying an icon increases, her grip on reality declines, and she goes full method.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve loved Marilyn my entire life. She\u2019s been such an influence in my career on Broadway. The roles I play, I always put some of her into it, into any role I originate,\u201d Hurder tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut actually playing her is, obviously, it\u2019s intimidating, because she is the icon of icons.",
      "\u201cSo what made it easier for me to approach it is: I am Robyn Hurder, who\u2019s playing Ivy Lynn, who\u2019s playing Marilyn Monroe,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cSmash\u201d aims to give a behind-the-scenes look at how a Broadway production is made, portraying the heightened dramatics expected of musical theater. The opening number, \u201cLet Me Be Your Star,\u201d features Hurder singing in costume as Marilyn, before the perspective shifts, showing Hurder as Ivy rehearsing in a studio surrounded by backup dancers, writers and the show\u2019s producer.",
      "In addition to Hurder and Bowman, \u201cSmash\u2019s\u201d main characters are actors playing the creative forces at work behind the scenes, like co-writers Tracy (Krysta Rodriguez) and Jerry (John Behlmann) and director\u2019s assistant Chloe (Bella Coppola).",
      "It\u2019s a similar format to the original show \u201cSmash,\u201d which starred Megan Hilty as Ivy, Katharine McPhee as Karen, as well as Debra Messing and Christian Borle as \u201cBombshell\u2019s\u201d writers and Angelica Huston as the show\u2019s producer.",
      "But it's a very different style. Instead of following Ivy and Karen's battle to play Marilyn and other interpersonal melodramatic dynamics, the Broadway show goes full tilt comedy.",
      "Bowman, calling the production an entry into the \u201c\u2018Smash\u2019 multiverse,\u201d is confident that the differences will appeal to even the most dedicated superfan of the original show, which has achieved an almost cult-like legacy since its cancellation after Season 2.",
      "\u201cI do feel like if those cult followers came to see this musical, and if they do give it a chance, they\u2019re going to be really pleasantly surprised,\u201d Bowman says.",
      "\u201cThe way the show took itself too seriously and then didn\u2019t take itself too seriously \u2014 we do the same thing,\" she adds. \"We don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously, and we lean into the funny elements that everybody kind of laughed at on the TV show.\u201d",
      "Making a Musical About a Musical",
      "Joshua Bergasse, who choreographed both the 2012 show and the Broadway production, says the original idea for NBC\u2019s \u201cSmash\u201d was, \u201cWe\u2019ll do one season, and then we\u2019ll have the show within the show, and that show will then move to Broadway.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, it actually took 14 years to make the first one come to Broadway,\u201d Bergasse adds with a laugh.",
      "Bergasse says part of why a Broadway production of \u201cBombshell\u201d \u2014 the musical about the life of Marilyn Monroe within the \u201cSmash\u201d storyline \u2014 didn\u2019t work is because the part of Marilyn would be simply too demanding.",
      "The \u201cSmash\u201d musical uses the same songs from the 2012 show, many of which are energetic, dance-heavy, blockbuster numbers, like \u201c20th Century Fox Mambo\u201d and \u201cThe National Pastime.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhoever played Marilyn would literally play one performance then probably die because she would have to do too much,\u201d Bergasse says.",
      "The show-within-a-show format offered a solution to that problem, with the Monroe numbers being performed by Ivy, Karen and even Chloe at one point.",
      "When it came to choreographing the show, Bergasse, who won an Emmy for his work on \u201cSmash\u201d and now is nominated for a 2025 Tony Award for best choreography, says he looked back at the TV series and \u201creinvented\u201d memorable moments for the stage. \u201cCut, Print... Moving On\u201d is now used to show the staccato pacing of rehearsals. \u201c20th Century Fox Mambo\u201d occurs as a backdrop to show the passage of time, Ivy\u2019s continuing descent into Marilyn madness and Karen\u2019s potential to take over the lead role.",
      "And as Bergasse was choreographing and developing the musical, the writers were taking notes. While the script was in development, Bergasse provided feedback on how the dialogue of a Broadway rehearsal would actually go.",
      "\"I would say to the writers, 'Guys, I would never say that,'\" Bergasse says with a laugh.",
      "\u201cI was just happy that it makes sense,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo all my dancer and choreographer friends will come and say, \u2018Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bowman says the real-life actors also played a role in the show's creation, albeit unintentionally.",
      "\u201cI felt like the writers, too, kind of were really listening to conversations that we were having, because then suddenly, like lines would show up in the script and we\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh my gosh. That was said in rehearsal yesterday,\u2019\u201d Bowman said.",
      "When it came to preparing for the part, Hurder says playing Ivy took some of the pressure off as she donned Marilyn\u2019s iconic blond curls and white halter dress. She says she watched Monroe\u2019s movies, read biographies, and studied her mannerisms and speech patterns.",
      "\u201cPlaying Ivy Lynn, I\u2019m just being myself. Like when people see that, they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re Robyn,\u2019\u201d Hurder says.",
      "\u201cSo I kind of apply Robyn into Ivy, and then I did what Robyn would do,\" she adds. \"... I did not want to do an impression. I just want to honor (Marilyn Monroe) in the most authentic way.\u201d",
      "In the story of the show, as Ivy\u2019s method acting approach goes south, the creative team can't agree on how to tell the story of an icon. From the beginning, the show\u2019s writers insist they don\u2019t want to tell the sob story of Monroe; rather, they want to celebrate her status as legend. But as they write more songs and opening night barrels closer, they end up with emotional ballads, and the narrative arc bends toward tragedy.",
      "\u201cA lot of this stuff is stuff that happens \u2014 it\u2019s a little exaggerated for dramatical purposes, but it\u2019s not far off,\u201d Bergasse says. \u201cLots of times you create something, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a minute that is not what I meant to do.\u2019",
      "\u201cWhen Jerry says at the end, \u2018How did we do everything exactly the opposite of what we meant to do?\u2019 You know, that happens,\u201d he adds.",
      "Updating a Cult Favorite",
      "When Hurder got the audition for Ivy, she went back to re-watch the 2012 show, 12 years later, and she \u201creally, really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "But she adds, \"We can't take that TV show and put it on stage in 2025. We had to change it. They wanted to make it a comedy, and we need to laugh right now.\"",
      "The script is notably different, including how it portrays the nature of Ivy and Karen's relationship. Instead of the perpetual chorus girl going up against the naive Broadway newbie, Ivy is a beloved veteran of the stage and Karen is her longtime friend and understudy.",
      "Like Hurder, Bowman says Karen \u201cfeels very close to who I am as a human.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know what it feels like to cover a star,\u201d says Bowman, who before \u201cSmash,\u201d was the standby for Norma Desmond in \u201cSunset Boulevard.\u201d \u201cI have been a swing and understudy, a standby, a principal, supporting and leading lady. So it\u2019s really not difficult to tap into what it feels like to always be ready and be on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Karen and Ivy\u2019s friendship is established early in the Broadway production. Hurder describes them as \u201cbest friends\u201d with a strong working relationship.",
      "The musical also touches on the note that their bond transcends a job. Ivy goes on to alienate the rest of the cast, including her friend, but in the end, it\u2019s Karen who helps pull her back to the reality and says, \u201cOur friendship means more than anything to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just not trendy to pit women against each other,\u201d Bowman says, emphasizing the importance of this in 2025. \u201cThese girls, they butt heads, but in a different way and it's kind of a funny way. I just think it\u2019s so special to have two women, especially two leading ladies like Robyn and I, be in the show together and be on each other\u2019s same level.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s hilarious is like, I would never be able to understudy Robyn Hurder in my real life,\u201d Bowman adds. \u201cI can\u2019t do what that woman can do.\u201d"

    "summary": "Who is the killer in \"Fear Street: Prom Queen\"? Does the movie connect to the original trilogy? All your questions about the horror film and its ending, answered.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post has spoilers for the ending of \u201cFear Street: Prom Queen.\u201d",
      "Fans of the \"Fear Street\" franchise know to expect a few things from a new installment: blood, witchcraft and high school terror. \"Fear Street: Prom Queen,\" which premiered on Netflix May 23, delivers all of the above \u2014 this time taking viewers to the cursed town of Shadyside in the '80s, in classic slasher style.",
      "The movie follows outsider Lori Granger (India Fowler) whose social status is low as everyone believes her mother murdered her father.",
      "\"I played it as though she had this intuitive rejection towards that story,\" India Fowler tells TODAY.com. \"She wasn't going to accept it.\"",
      "Lori decides to run for prom queen, believing that \u201cit\u2019s time for something to change.\u201d She runs against five other girls for the coveted title, but one in particular seems to be Lori's biggest competition: her longtime bully Tiffany Falconer (Fina Strazza).",
      "When prom night comes around, it's revealed that two serial killers are roaming the grounds, secretly picking off the six unfortunate prom queen candidates \u2014 and their dates \u2014 one by one.",
      "Who is the killer and what are their motives?",
      "Unaware of all the killings, Lori sneaks away from the dancing promgoers with crush Tyler (David Iacono) for a private moment. The killer discovers them and immediately kills Tyler. Lori makes a quick escape, running into her friend Megan (Suzanna Son) who is also fleeing the killer. The two eventually make it back to prom and try to warn everyone about the danger. But everyone ignores them as Lori is crowned prom queen and pulled up onto the stage.",
      "She begs for people to listen to her, but nobody does, before the killer cuts through the crowd with an axe. He then gets on the stage and tries to kill Lori, but Megan jumps on him, giving Lori the opportunity to plunge the crown into his eye. He falls to the ground in pain and pulls his mask off, revealing that Tiffany's dad, Dan Falconer (Chris Klein), is the culprit.",
      "In front of everyone, he admits to his wife and daughter that he did it \"because I knew how much you wanted it, both of you.\"",
      "His wife, Nancy Falconer (Katherine Waterston), is shocked by the revelation, but stays behind to answer the police's questions as Tiffany and Lori \u2014 who happen to be neighbors \u2014 are sent home with police officers.",
      "In the car ride home, Tiffany begins her redemption, apologizing to Lori and admitting that she was \"never good enough\" for her parents, and she's always \"felt like nothing.\"",
      "\"You start to sympathize with her,\" Fowler says. \"And I definitely, when reading the script, sympathized with Tiffany because it\u2019s back to that kind of teenage girl going through mental turmoil. You start seeing her as this real human, young woman.\"",
      "Finna Strazza describes her character as just being a \"product of her environment.\"",
      "\"She has always had a lot of pressure put on her her whole life, by her family, by her peers,\" she adds.",
      "When the girls finally reach their homes, Tiffany asks Lori not to leave. Lori offers to stay and goes inside, and the two spark a \"potential friendship\" after the night's bloody events, Fowler says.",
      "\"Lori will always choose to care for somebody and choose to be selfless,\" Fowler says.",
      "Eventually, Nancy Falconer gets home, but she's not a concerned mother \u2014 she's another killer. She grabs a knife and begins chasing the girls through the house while humming. Terrified, they hide in the closet. There, Tiffany begins freaking out that both her parents are dangerous, yet it turns out she is, too. Tiffany pulls out a knife and tries to kill Lori.",
      "Strazza says this part was not initially in the script.",
      "\u201cThe original version I read, Tiffany was not involved at all, and it was just the parents,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the scene that I was doing for my audition, she was just crying, and was like, \u2018Mom, how could you do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "Director Matt Palmer had her improvise being the killer during her final audition. Strazza landed the part, and the script was altered so she was involved in the gruesome finale.",
      "Even with the threat of Tiffany, Lori escapes, running into the hallway where Nancy stabs her in the shoulder blade. With Lori injured, Nancy admits that she used to date Lori's dad and reveals she killed him after he left her for Lori's mom. Nancy prepares to kill Lori, but Tiffany asks to do it.",
      "\"I warned you,\" Tiffany tells Lori before Lori kicks her, sending her flying over the banister where she is then impaled on a table decoration below.",
      "Strazza says that she always likes to do her own stunts, and this 12-foot fall was no different. She describes it as a \"roller coaster.\" But when it came time for the impalement, that was a silicone mold.",
      "\"They made an entirely silicone mold of my entire body, where I was first covered in silicone,\" she says. \"And while that hardened, they covered that in plaster, so I was just kind of stuck as this statue. It ended up taking six and a half hours to get my whole body, but the artistry that was involved in that was so impressive because it looked exactly like me. And it was kind of spooky to see that on set.\"",
      "\"I would walk past my own dead body, which was frightening,\" she adds.",
      "What does Lori's final line mean?",
      "With just Nancy left, Lori tries to escape, but the doors are locked. Eventually, Lori grabs a trophy and whacks Nancy in the head with it. She falls to the ground, slowly dying as she begs Lori for help.",
      "But Lori just walks away as Nancy spews insults, calling her \"trash,\" \"nothing\" and a \"nobody.\"",
      "Nancy's final words before slumping to her death are, \"Who the f--- do you think you are?\"",
      "\"I'm Lori f---ing Granger,\" Lori responds.",
      "Fowler considers the whole film to be Lori's journey to \"self-realization,\" with this final moment being her true acceptance of self.",
      "\"'I\u2019m Lori f---ing Granger' is that moment,\" she says. \"It\u2019s earnest. And she really has gone through it. And been there, like you\u2019ve seen her go through the turmoil.\"",
      "Fowler believes that after the film ends, Lori is \"definitely traumatized,\" but she hopes she comes to terms with what has happened.",
      "\"It would be interesting to imagine how she deals with self-redemption and self-acceptance, which I hope she's experiencing post film,\" she says.",
      "What does the end credit scene mean?",
      "Even though the film is on Netflix, stick around a little longer for an end credit scene. Although it's brief, fans of the \"Fear Street\" franchise will recognize the end credit scene ties the film back to the original trilogy.",
      "The end credit scene shows Nancy Falconer's dead body lying on the ground, blood oozing from her head. But then, the blood begins to form into the Witch's Mark \u2014 also known as the Devil\u2019s Mark from the original franchise.",
      "In the initial trilogy, the Witch's Mark was where Shadyside residents were sacrificed by the Goode family to Satan.",
      "Fowler calls this moment \"a nod to the curse\" from the original trilogy and a way for their film to \"pay homage\" to the origins.",
      "\"This film is its own thing,\" she says. \"You don't necessarily have to watch the first three to understand this film, but I think that they did such a good job of doing the subtle nod to the fact that Shadyside is a cursed town, and it's inescapable and it's still apparent.\"",
      "She adds that the end credits aren't the only \"Easter egg\" to the original trilogy. In fact, at the beginning of the film, there's a small shrine to everyone who died in the 1978 camp massacre, alluding to the events of the second film.",
      "Were the Falconers cursed?",
      "With that in mind, it begs the question: Was the Falconer family another victim of the curse of Shadyside?",
      "Strazza thinks so.",
      "\"I think there's something in the water,\" she says. \"I think that it's not a coincidence that these crazy people end up on the loose. Who knows who is connected to the Falconers in the past?\"",
      "Personally, Strazza thinks Tiffany \"sold her soul to the devil.\"",
      "One potential reason? Strazza pitches a search for \"forever beauty.\"",
      "\"That would be something the Falconers would be into,\" she adds."

      "But on prom night, each girl nominated is picked off one by one, slasher style, by a serial killer.",
      "Eventually, Tiffany's dad (Chris Klein) is revealed to be the killer \u2014 one of them, at least. After the big reveal, the police take a shocked Tiffany and Lori home as Mrs. Falconer (Katherine Waterston) stays to answer more questions. Tiffany asks Lori to come inside as she doesn't want to be alone, and Lori obliges.",
      "But when Mrs. Falconer eventually gets home, she pulls out a knife and begins chasing both girls around the house. They hide in a closet as Tiffany freaks out over her parents both being psychotic killers.",
      "But the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Tiffany soon pulls out a knife and tries to kill Lori herself, revealing the final twist: All three Falconers were in on it together.",
      "Fina Strazza, who plays Tiffany in the film, tells TODAY.com that this ending wasn't initially in the script. At first, her character was completely innocent.",

      "Then, in the final audition over Zoom, casting director Carmen Cuba and director Matt Palmer decided to test another layer to her character. They asked Strazza to improvise the scene as if she were the killer.",
      "\"I was a little bit put on the spot,\" she admits. \"I was a little nervous about that, because that\u2019s a big responsibility to take on in just one moment.\"",
      "\"I did a little something, and afterwards, Matt and Carmen were like, 'Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s kind of cool?' I was like, 'Yeah, it was awesome.' I guess it worked,\" she says. \"It landed me the part.\"",

      "Strazza's co-star India Fowler, who played Lori Granger in the film, tells TODAY.com she has mixed feelings on the movie's ending. Part of her \"loves\" it because it's so \"shocking,\" but another part wishes the original ending could have made the cut. She says that part of her would have liked to see Tiffany and Lori form a friendship ... or even more.",
      "\"There's another side of me, which sort of thinks that Tiffany and Lori, there's a secret love affair going on,\" she says. \"And so, I have this kind of inward dream that there's a universe where Tiffany is innocent and actually she's expressing her love for Lori in a weird way.\"",
      "Fowler adds that Strazza was not alone in being directed to improvise certain moments. For the teens' dance battle, Strazza was taught classic '80s choreography, but Fowler was asked to improvise.",
      "\"Matt (Palmer) thought it was important that Lori didn't have any form of choreography,\" Fowler says. \"They really just said, 'Feel free to just be free and dance' ... That was just left up to me, which I quite liked.\""

The theme park has five different worlds with more than 50 new attractions, including the buzzed-about ride at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter\u2014Ministry of Magic.",
      "The premise takes place after Lord Voldemort has been defeated, and Dolores Umbridge is being put on trial. Guests enter a lift and soon after the ride begins, they are greeted by Harry, Ron and Hermione, all of whom are on their way to see Umbridge\u2019s trial. However, things take a turn when Umbridge escapes, and a quest to stop her before she does permanent damage ensues.",
      "Thought people can visit Epic Universe right now, it might take some time to actually get to the front of the line due to popular demand. To hold you over, TODAY.com got a sneak peek at Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry prior to its official opening.",
      "(Universal is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",

      "The entrance to Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry is marked with a sign that reads \u201cMetrofloo\u201d over a tunnel-like opening. The Metrofloo is inspired by the Floo Network in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise, which is a mass transit system that lets wizards and witches travel to and from places including the Ministry of Magic, or the government of the British wizarding world.",

      "The Metrofloo",
      "After walking through the Metrofloo\u2019s tunnel, guests will come to an area with several entryways illuminated in green.

      "Visitors then walk through a smaller tunnel until coming across a second entryway, which puffs out another round of green smoke.",
      "The Ministry of Magic atrium",
      "After getting through the second round of green smoke, visitors are officially in the atrium of the Ministry of Magic.",

      "In the Hall of Ministers, guests encounter a bust of the first-ever minister of magic, Ulick Gamp, interacting with the other moving pictures in the room.",
      "Perhaps the most notable room is Umbridge\u2019s regal office, where her belongings are scattered or thrown into packing boxes. Her house elf, Higgledy, sits atop her furniture \u2014 and it\u2019s certainly not the last you see of her.",
      "The lift and ride premise",
      "Once visitors arrive at the end of the queue, there are several lifts with two rows of seats awaiting guests.",
      "Once settled, the ride will take you to a motion simulator screen where Harry, Ron and Heroine greet riders on the way to see Umbridge\u2019s trial. However, a turn of events unfold as Umbridge escapes and a Death Eater comes to her aid. The rest of the journey sees the trio of best friends fight to capture Umbridge  and make sure justice is served.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 If President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want international students at Harvard, there are plenty of foreign governments and universities happy to take them \u2014 along with their talents that have helped make the United States a global tech and scientific leader.",
      "The future of international students at the oldest, richest and most renowned university in the U.S. is uncertain after the Trump administration announced a ban on their enrollment starting in the 2025-26 academic year.",
      "After Harvard refused to turn over extensive data about its international students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the school was being held accountable for \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\u201d",
      "Harvard has sued over the move, calling it unlawful, and on Friday a federal judge in Boston put it on hold for two weeks. If the Trump administration prevails, new international students would be barred from enrolling at Harvard while current ones would be forced to either transfer elsewhere or lose their legal status.",
      "U.S. universities including Harvard rely heavily on international students, who often pay far more in tuition than their American classmates. Many of them end up staying in the U.S., where they have been responsible for major breakthroughs in strategically important fields such as artificial intelligence where the U.S., China and other nations are locked in intense competition.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign against Harvard is a \u201cterrible policy error\u201d that could undermine the world-leading role the U.S. has played in research and development since World War II, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "A downturn in international students would affect American universities\u2019 \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d and income, while benefiting U.S. competitors, he said. \u201cChina will become significantly more attractive than before to students and researchers from the Global South,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWestern Europe will also gain significantly.\u201d",
      "There was already growing unease among international students at U.S. universities amid anti-immigrant rhetoric by Trump, in addition to deep funding cuts and efforts to intervene in universities\u2019 internal operations. Hundreds of students\u2019 visas have been revoked, while the Trump administration has detained and sought to deport others over pro-Palestinian and other activism.",
      "At Harvard, more than a quarter of the student body of about 25,000 comes from overseas and the looming ban has caught up students from more than 140 countries, including the future queen of Belgium.",
      "Harvard\u2019s biggest group of overseas students, about 20%, come from China, which was long the top source of international students in the U.S. before being overtaken by India last year.",
      "The number of Chinese students in the U.S. has been dropping \u2014to about 277,000 during the 2023-24 school year, compared with more than 372,000 in 2019-20 \u2014 due to disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic as well as growing U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Chinese academics were also driven away by the China Initiative, a national security program from Trump\u2019s first term that drew accusations of racial profiling. Many of them have moved their research to Chinese universities.",
      "Responding to the Harvard ban, Beijing said U.S.-China educational cooperation is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and that it would \u201csafeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars overseas.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina has consistently opposed the politicization of educational exchanges,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Friday. \u201cSuch actions by the U.S. will only damage its own image and international credibility.\u201d",
      "Izzy Shen, 23, an incoming Harvard student from Beijing, said her  visa application was refused hours after Trump\u2019s Harvard ban.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so fast,\u201d said Shen, whose application had already been marked \u201capproved.\u201d",
      "Shen, who was admitted to Harvard\u2019s Master in Design Engineering program, said she remained \u201crelatively optimistic\u201d and that the situation would \u201cget clearer\u201d after the injunction hearing Thursday.",
      "Duo Yi, who was admitted to the PhD Public Policy program at Harvard Kenny School, said she is now exploring other options amid growing uncertainty about her enrolment. Trump is \u201csimply too unpredictable,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no way of knowing what direction his future policies will take.\u201d",
      "Foreign governments and universities are not waiting to woo the Harvard students spurned by Trump. In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, officials have urged universities to take proactive action \u201cto attract top talent.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cdoors are wide open\u201d to \u201cany students who face discrimination and unfair treatment in the U.S.,\u201d John Lee, the city\u2019s top leader, said Tuesday.",
      "Hong Kong has four universities in the top 100 of U.S. News & World Report\u2019s Best Global Universities Rankings, which is topped by Harvard, though experts say academic freedom in the former British colony of 7.5 million people has eroded since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020.",
      "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said Friday that Harvard undergraduates and postgraduates, as well as students with confirmed offers of admission, were welcome to study there instead.",
      "Europe has also sought to lure scientists worried about funding cuts and freedom of research under Trump, launching a $570 million initiative this month called \u201cChoose Europe.\u201d",
      "Though she did not mention Trump by name, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized \u201cfree and open research\u201d in a speech promoting the initiative at Sorbonne University in Paris.",
      "\u201cAs threats rise across the world, Europe will not compromise on its principles,\u201d she said. \u201cEurope must remain the home of academic and scientific freedom.\u201d",
      "Despite concerns about the Harvard ban, Alex Zeng, an overseas education consultant based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said American universities remained the top choice for many Chinese students.",
      "\u201cThe rich still want to go to the U.S. for education,\u201d Zeng said."

    "story": [
      "The European Union has pushed back against President Donald Trump\u2019s latest suggestion that he will impose a 50% import tariff on all E.U. goods, warning that trans-Atlantic trade must be built on \u201crespect, not threats.\u201d",
      "The rebuke came after Trump said in a Friday post on his Truth Social platform that trade negotiations with Brussels were \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d and suggested he would slap a 50% blanket duty on all European goods entering the U.S. starting June 1.",
      "But on Sunday, Trump announced that the new date for the tariff to go into effect would be July 9, after he said Ursula Von Der Leyden \u2014 president of the European Commission \u2014 called him and requested he push back the date.",
      "It was just the latest bellicose remark from Trump and came amid a broader souring of relations between the two global powers that has seen months of distrust and economic sparring.",
      "The E.U., home to nearly 450 million people, is the world\u2019s largest trading bloc and one of Washington\u2019s top commercial partners. It exported more than $600 billion in goods to the U.S. last year while importing goods worth around $370 billion.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest broadside follows his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement of a 39% tariff on European goods, an idea he later walked back before he changed course again Friday with an even tougher stance.",
      "Stephen Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, told the BBC that his former boss was expressing his frustration with the E.U.",
      "\u201cI think he was hoping that by now we would have the E.U. coming with some kind of deal on the table, and so far that hasn\u2019t come,\u201d he said, calling the 50% import tariffs a \u201cshot at the bow.\u201d",

      "While the E.U.\u2019s response signals a willingness to negotiate, discord has deepened between the bloc and its longtime trans-Atlantic ally over a return to the combative stance Trump took during his first administration, when he flew in the face of decades of cooperation and cast the E.U. as an economic rival.",
      "In 2018, Trump said \u201cnobody treats us much worse than the European Union\u201d and argued the bloc was designed to exploit the U.S. He repeated that claim this year, describing the E.U. as being \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",
      "While the ideological architects of Trump's first administration such as Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro have also gone on record criticizing the union, many in Trump\u2019s current inner circle have shared those sentiments.",

      "\u201cThe threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe,\u201d Vance said, \u201cis the threat from within \u2014 the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "That came after Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man, who also served as Trump\u2019s close adviser earlier in his second term \u2014 threw his support behind Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has called for Germany to leave the E.U.",
      "Underlying much of the second Trump administration\u2019s animosity toward Europe has been security funding, most prominently over the war in Ukraine.",
      "While the administration\u2019s view of the war in Ukraine has since softened, Vance has repeatedly opposed sending military aid to Kyiv, saying in February that \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d",
      "And in a Signal conversation between senior administration officials leaked in March, the vice president initially resisted U.S. strikes in Yemen, arguing he didn\u2019t want to \u201cbail Europe out,\u201d while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that Europe was treating America like a \u201csucker\u201d by relying on it for defense.",
      "While \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s call for a \u201cdeal that works for both\u201d reflects the E.U.\u2019s characteristically restrained response to the Trump administration\u2019s jabs, Europe has been bracing itself for months for the possibility of a more distant economic relationship with the U.S. too.",
      "Earlier this month, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the bloc preferred to negotiate, \u201cbut not at any cost,\u201d before announcing more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods the following day.",
      "Europe also appears to be preparing for a future without America\u2019s guarantee of European security against Russia. Germany this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.",
      "A brewing trade war with the bloc throws into relief the position of Britain, which voted to leave the E.U. in 2016, but recently signed a trade deal with Europe and an economic deal with the U.S.",
      "London appears to have sidestepped the steepest tariffs after Trump agreed last month to hold the levy on British goods at 10%, but the U.K. must now walk a delicate line: maintaining its \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Washington while seeking closer alignment with its largest trading partner in Brussels.",
      "But with tensions rising across the Atlantic, even allies risk being caught in the crossfire. The E.U. \u2014 a geopolitical heavyweight in its own right \u2014 is unlikely to take hefty U.S. tariffs lying down without making moves of its own."

      "The win for \"It Was Just an Accident\" extend one of the most unprecedented streaks in movies: The indie distributor Neon has backed the last six Palme d'or winners. Neon, which acquired \"It Was Just an Accident\" for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \"Parasite,\" \"Titane,\" \"Triangle of Sadness,\" \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"Anora.\"",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \"Parasite\" and \"Anora,\" won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes, and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\"It Was Just an Accident\" was inspired by Panahi's experience in jail. In it, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "\"The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\" Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \"Art will always win. What is human will always win.\"",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "Other winners at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama \"Sentimental Value,\" his lauded follow-up to \"The Worst Person in the World.\" Some had expected \"Sentimental Value\" to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\"We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\"",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho's Brazilian political thriller \"The Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \"The Secret Agent\" showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \"That was our wish.\"",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \"I'm Still Here\" in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \"show that our country's cinema is second to none.\"",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe's desert road trip \"Sir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \"Sound of Falling.\" Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \"The Little Sister,\" Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Jean-Luc and Pierre Dardennes, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \"Young Mothers.\" Cannes' award for best first film went to Hasan Hadi, for \"The President's Cake,\" making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "What else shaped Cannes this year",
      "Saturday's ceremony brings to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \"Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn't ship that way,\" said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \"The Phoenician Scheme\" at the festival.",
      "That was one of the top American films in Cannes, along with Spike Lee's \"Highest 2 Lowest,\" the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning\" and Ari Aster's \"Eddington.\""

      "Earlier, about 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity after a high-voltage line fell Saturday morning, electricity network operator RTE said on X.
