      "As a Biden administration ban on so-called \u201cjunk fees\u201d took effect Monday, Ticketmaster said it will start displaying the full price of a ticket as soon as consumers begin shopping.",
      "Ticketmaster, long a subject of complaints about its hidden fees, was among those targeted by the new rule, which was announced in December by the Federal Trade Commission. The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday it commended the FTC\u2019s action.",
      "\u201cTicketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing to become the nationwide standard so fans can easily compare prices across all ticketing sites,\u201d Ticketmaster Chief Operating Officer Michael Wichser said in a statement.",
      "Ticketmaster said it will also tell shoppers where they are in line when they log in to buy tickets to an event. It will also give real-time updates to customers whose wait times exceed 30 minutes, letting them know ticket price ranges, availability and whether new event dates have been added.",
      "Ticketmaster, which is owned by Beverly Hills, California-based concert promoter Live Nation, is the world\u2019s largest ticket seller, processing 500 million tickets each year in more than 30 countries. Around 70% of tickets for major concert venues in the U.S. are sold through Ticketmaster.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday's changes will bring North America in line with the rest of the world, where the full ticket price was already displayed as soon as customers started shopping.",
      "It has been in the hot seat since 2022, when its site crashed during a presale event for Taylor Swift\u2019s upcoming stadium tour. The company said its site was overwhelmed by both fans and attacks from bots, which were posing as consumers in order to scoop up tickets and sell them on secondary sites. Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue.",
      "Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly that drives up U.S. ticket prices and asking a court to break them up. That case is ongoing.",
      "President Donald Trump is also eyeing the industry. In March, he signed an executive order that he said will help curb ticket scalping and bring \u201ccommonsense\u201d changes to the way live events are priced.",
      "Under the order, the FTC must ensure \u201cprice transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process\u201d and take enforcement to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct.",
      "\u201cAnyone who\u2019s bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years \u2014 no matter what your politics are \u2014 knows that it\u2019s a conundrum,\u201d said Kid Rock, who joined Trump in the Oval Office as Trump signed the order.",

      "The Cannes Film Festival red carpet is perhaps the most rigidly controlled red carpet in the world",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival red carpet is perhaps the most rigidly controlled red carpet in the world. Now, the festival has added a new stipulation: no nudity.",
      "While nudity was never previously endorsed at the festival, Cannes updated its dress policy on the eve of its 78th edition to read that \u201cnudity is prohibited on the red carpet, as well as in any other area of the festival.\u201d",
      "While a no-shirt-no-service policy is standard in places far less glamorous than Cannes, the policy tweak sparked widespread attention Monday because of the recent trend of sheer and \u201cnude dresses, \u201d such as Bianca Censori's Grammys appearance.",
      "Asked for clarity on the policy, Cannes press officers said the festival \u201cmade explicit in its charter certain rules that have long been in effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe aim is not to regulate attire per se, but to prohibit full nudity on the red carpet, in accordance with the institutional framework of the event and French law,\u201d it said.",
      "Cannes also noted that \u201cvoluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train, that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theater are not permitted.\u201d",
      "Still, skin has often been flashed at the French Riviera festival by celebrities like Bella Hadid, Naomi Campbell and Kendall Jenner, and dress policies have long been flouted by celebrities. For evening premieres at the Palais' Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lumi\u00e8re, black tie and evening wear is required. Though not in recent years, Cannes security officials have sometimes turned away women for not wearing heels.",
      "The festival also banned selfies in 2018 \u2014 Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux called them \u201cgrotesque\u201d \u2014 but A-listers sometimes snap a quick photo on the Palais steps.",

      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government",
      "NEW YORK -- Poet Marie Howe, one of this year's winners of the Pulitzer Prize, says being a writer is often less a career than a vocation. You rely on teaching and other outside work and seek support from foundations or from a government agency, like the National Endowment for the Arts.",
      "\u201cEverybody applies for an NEA grant, year after after year, and if you get it, it's like wow \u2014 it's huge,\" says Howe, a Pulitzer winner for \u201cNew and Selected Poems\u201d and a former NEA creative writing fellow. \u201cIt's not just the money. It's also deep encouragement. I just felt so grateful. It made a big, big difference. It gives you courage. It says to you, \u2018Go on, keep doing it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government \u2014 the grants from the NEA or National Endowment for the Humanities that enable a writer to complete a book, a community theater to stage a play, a scholar to access archival documents or a museum to organize an exhibit.",
      "For decades, there has been a nationwide artistic and cultural infrastructure receiving bipartisan support, including through the first administration of Donald Trump.",
      "Now that is changing \u2014 and drastically.",
      "Since returning to office in January, the president has alleged that federal agencies and institutions such as the NEA, NEH, PBS, the Kennedy Center and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) were advancing a \u201cwoke agenda\u201d that undermined traditional values.",
      "Trump has ousted leaders, cut or eliminated programs and dramatically shifted priorities: At the same time the NEH and NEA were forcing out staff members and canceling grants, they announced a multimillion-dollar initiative to support statues for Trump's proposed \"National Garden of American Heroes,\u201d from George Washington to Shirley Temple.",
      "\u201cAll future awards will, among other things, be merit-based, awarded to projects that do not promote extreme ideologies based upon race or gender, and that help to instill an understanding of the founding principles and ideals that make America an exceptional country,\" reads a statement on the NEH website.",
      "Individuals and organizations across the country, and across virtually every art form, now find themselves without money they had budgeted for or even spent, anticipating they would be reimbursed.",
      "Electric Literature, McSweeney's and n+1 are among dozens of literary publications that received notices their grants have been rescinded. Philadelphia's Rosenbach Museum & Library had to halt a project to create an online catalog after losing a near-$250,000 grant from the IMLS. The Stuttering Association for the Young, which manages a summer music camp, has a $35,000 gap.",
      "\u201cOur fundraising allows kids to attend our summer camp at a greatly reduced cost so the lost funds make it harder to fulfill that commitment,\" says the association's director, Russell Krumnow, who added that \u201cwe planned our programming and made decisions with those funds in mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cGovernment money ought to be consistent. It ought to be reliable,\u201d says Talia Corren, co-executive director of the New York-based Alliance of Resident Theatres, which assists hundreds of nonprofit theater companies. \u201cYou need to make decisions based on that money.\u201d",
      "The NEA, NEH and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were among the institutions established 60 years ago, during the height of President Lyndon Johnson's \u201cGreat Society\u201d domestic programs. At various times, they have faced criticism for supporting provocative artists, such as photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the 1980s. But they have endured, in part, because of their perceived economic benefits, distributed through as many congressional districts as possible.",
      "Arts advocates contend that, like other forms of federal aid, the importance of an NEA or NEH grant isn\u2019t just the initial money, but the \u201cripple\u201d or \u201cmutliplier\u201d effect. Government backing often carries the kind of prestige that makes a given organization more desirable to private donors.",
      "The millions of dollars channeled through state arts and humanities councils in turn support local projects. Funding for a theater production helps generate jobs for the cast and crew, brings in business for neighboring restaurants and bars and parking garages and spending money for the babysitter hired by parents having a night out.",
      "Actor Jane Alexander was just beginning her stage career when the endowment helped fund the 1967 Arena Stage production of Howard Sackler's drama about boxer Jack Johnson, \u201cThe Great White Hope,\" which starred Alexander and James Earl Jones and eventually won the Pulitzer Prize. Alexander, who headed the NEA in the 1990s, remembered how Arena co-founder Zelda Fichandler worried that the endowment might hurt business by supporting other theaters in Washington.",
      "\u201cAnd I remember my late husband (Robert Alexander) who was artistic director of the Living Stage Theatre Company at the time, saying to her, 'No, it doesn\u2019t work that way. A rising tide floats all boats,\" she says.",
      "In the short term, organizations are seeking donations from the general public and philanthropists are attempting to fill in fiscal holes. The Mellon Foundation recently announced an \u201cemergency\u201d $15 million fund for state humanities councils. At the Portland Playhouse in Oregon, artistic director Brian Weaver says that donors stepped in after the theater lost a $25,000 NEA grant just a day before they were to open a production of \u201cJoe Turner's Come and Gone,\u201d",
      "But Weaver and others say private fundraising alone isn't a long-term solution, if only because individuals incur \u201cdonor fatigue\u201d and philanthropists change their minds. Jane Alexander remembers when the Arena theater in Washington founded a repertory company, supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.",
      "\u201cIt was like the National Theatre in Britain,\" she says. '\"We felt so proud that we can have a repertory company of 30 players rotating players through the season. It was very, very exciting. And we had, you know, voice lessons, we had fencing lessons. We were going to become the great company. And guess what happened? Rockefeller\u2019s priorities changed.\u201d",

      "\u201cAndor\u201d changed all that. Coping with inner pain has been a theme throughout its two-season run, which comes to a close Tuesday when Disney+ releases a series-finale trilogy of episodes. It starts with its title character, who is left rootless by the deaths and destruction around him.",
      "\u201cEverything has been taken away from him since day one,\u201d Diego Luna, who plays Cassian Andor, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd he has to understand that home is inside.

      "The three final episodes take Andor and the rest of the characters up to the events of \u201cRogue One,\u201d the 2016 film that spawned the streaming prequel series. Tony Gilroy, who wrote \u201cRogue One\u201d and is the show runner for \u201cAndor,\u201d has loved playing in the Star Wars galaxy, but he\u2019s made it clear his real mission is to tell universal stories of the effects of war, revolution and colonization on human (and occasionally non-human) souls.",
      "Nearly every character he\u2019s created is ravaged in one way or another, and even the lighthearted moments of the series are fraught with emotional pain. (Spoilers ahead for episodes 1-9 of Season 2.)",
      "When Andor goes undercover as a moussed-and-mulleted fashion designer named Varian Skye and makes small talk with a hotel staffer, he learns the man's family was killed in a notorious massacre by Grand Moff Tarkin, the imperial leader who would later order the destruction of Leia's world.",

      "No one on \u201cAndor\u201d undergoes more trauma than Bix Caleen, played by Adria Arjona. While still dealing with the fallout of being tortured by an imperial doctor in the first season, she is nearly raped early in the second and has been surrounded by death. Arjona said seeing the script was daunting.",
      "\u201cShe has to go from PTSD to sort of being addicted to droppers, which help her sleep and get over the nightmares, to then her last final decision,\u201d Arjona told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot. And reading it was incredibly scary.\u201d",
      "An utterly new for \u201cStar Wars\u201d set of scenes between Cassian and Bix explore both the explicit and subtle difficulties of intimate relationships amid trauma. Cassian must comfort Bix, but she doesn't want her pain to define her.",
      "The two try to take a trip to the neighborhood bodega, but even that is subsumed by his fear for her.",

      "Sharing online was second nature for Kim Kardashian, an extension of her fame",
      "PARIS -- The ring gleamed in Instagram posts. So did the diamond necklace and the luxury Paris address. For Kim Kardashian, sharing online was second nature, an extension of her fame. But in the early hours of Oct. 3, 2016, that openness was turned against her.",
      "Five masked men posing as police officers stormed the residence where she was staying during Fashion Week. They bound her with duct tape and plastic cable ties, locked her in the bathroom and fled with an estimated $6 million in stolen jewelry.",
      "The robbery sent shock waves far beyond Paris. It was the latest moment when celebrity exposure \u2014 fueled by social media updates and glamour on display \u2014 collided with real-world risk.",
      "The late fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld offered a characteristically blunt assessment in the days that followed. Speaking to The Associated Press, he criticized Kardashian\u2019s hyper-visibility in an era when fame can come with serious vulnerabilities.",
      "\u201c(She is) too public, too public \u2014 we have to see in what time we live,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot display your wealth then be surprised that some people want to share it,\u201d he added, questioning why she was in a hotel with no security.",
      "On Tuesday, Kardashian takes the stand in a trial that began last month, nearly a decade after the robbery. She will finally face the men accused of carrying out one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history.",
      "What made the robbery extraordinary was not just its high-profile victim but how investigators believe she was targeted. Kardashian had posted real-time updates from her hotel suite. She showed off a 20-carat diamond ring, gifted by her then-husband Kanye West, hours before it was stripped from her hand.",
      "The attackers used no digital trackers or hacking tools. Instead, investigators believe they followed Kardashian\u2019s digital breadcrumbs \u2014 images, timestamps, geotags \u2014 and exploited them with old-school criminal methods.",
      "It was, some suggested at the time, a blueprint built from her own broadcast.",
      "The men dressed as police, spoke only French and overpowered the concierge, who was forced to act as a translator during the break-in.",
      "\u201cI thought it was terrorists,\u201d Kardashian later told a French magistrate in 2017. \u201cThat they were going to kill me.\u201d",
      "The robbery forced Kardashian to consider how she lived, posted and protected herself. Her brand had been built on access, her life broadcast to millions. But that strategy had collapsed.",
      "\u201cI learned to be more private,\u201d she later said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the risk.\u201d",
      "Kardashian enhanced her security detail by hiring people with backgrounds in elite protective services, reportedly including former members of the U.S. Secret Service and CIA. She stopped posting her location in real time. Lavish gifts and jewelry all but vanished from her feed.",
      "\u201cI was definitely materialistic before \u2026 but I\u2019m so happy that my kids get this me,\" she reflected on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2017.",
      "Later, Kardashian acknowledged that constant sharing had made her a target.",
      "\u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Her retreat set off a ripple effect across Hollywood and the fashion world.",
      "Model Gigi Hadid increased her private security detail in the months after the heist. She was spotted at Paris fashion shows flanked by multiple guards. Kendall Jenner, Kardashian\u2019s sister, reportedly took similar steps ahead of the 2016 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show in Paris, following new protocols on personal protection and digital discretion. Publicists and managers began advising clients to delay posts, remove location tags and think twice before flashing luxury online.",
      "Visibility remained currency, but for some the rules had changed.",
      "Surveillance footage helped French police reconstruct the timeline of the robbery, but the breakthrough came from a trace of DNA left on the plastic ties used to bind Kardashian.",
      "It matched Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, a veteran criminal whose DNA was in the national database. Phone taps and surveillance led police to others, including Yunice Abbas and Didier Dubreucq, known as \u201cYeux bleus.\u201d Most of the accused have long criminal records.",
      "Abbas later claimed he was unaware of Kardashian\u2019s identity during the heist.",
      "But investigators say the men acted with detailed planning and discipline. Prepaid phones were activated the day before the heist and abandoned immediately afterward. But in the end, it wasn\u2019t enough.",
      "Kardashian, once mocked by some of the French press as a reality TV sideshow, is now at the center of a case with deep cultural resonance.",

She was 16 at the time and alleges he first sexually assaulted her days after they met.",

      "NEW YORK -- Historian Ron Chernow's latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant.",
      "The 1,200-page \u201cMark Twain\u201d will be published next week. It's Chernow's first release since his Grant biography came out in 2017, and the first time he has taken on a literary writer after a career defined by celebrated books about business leaders (John D. Rockefeller, the Morgan dynasty), presidents (Grant and Washington) and, most of all, Alexander Hamilton. His many honors include the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cWashington: A Life,\u201d the National Book Award for \u201cThe House of Morgan\u201d and the National Book Critics Circle prize for \u201cTitan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.\u201d",
      "But a book on Twain had been in his thoughts for decades, dating back to when he saw Hal Holbrook play him on stage in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cAnd there he was, with the white suit and cigar and mustache and he was tossing out one hilarious line after another,\u201d the 76-year-old Chernow says, remembering such Twain quips as \u201cThere's no distinctly Native American criminal class, except Congress.\u201d Chernow became fascinated by Twain as a prototype of the modern celebrity and found himself drawn less to \u201cMark Twain the novelist than the pundit, the personality and the platform artist.\u201d",
      "Chernow admittedly is more comfortable with the researchable world of facts than with the more intangible qualities of the imagination. But he found much to identify with Twain, relating to him as a fellow widower (Twain outlived his wife, Olivia, by six years; Chernow's wife, Valerie Stearn, died in 2006), as a public speaker and as an author fortunate enough to write full time.",
      "Chernow also looks closely into subjects familiar to him \u2014 politics and finance, notably the various failed business ventures that left Twain short of money despite his author royalties and the inherited wealth of his wife. Toward the end of the book, the historian addresses the friendships an elderly Twain cultivated with teen and preteen girls, whom Twain called his \u201cangelfish.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the time Twain\u2019s behavior was regarded as the charming eccentricity of a beloved humorist with a soft spot for children. We look at that same behavior today and find it odd and disturbing. It's important to get both perspectives,\u201d Chernow says. \u201cTwain\u2019s behavior was chaste and none of the angelfish or their parents ever accused him of improper or predatory behavior. At the same time, there was such an obsessive quality about Twain\u2019s attention to these teenage girls \u2014 he devoted more time to them than to his own daughters.\u201d",
      "During a recent interview at his Upper West Side Manhattan apartment, where his glass of Diet Coke stood on a coaster illustrated with a sketch of Twain receiving an honorary college degree, Chernow also reflected on Twain's family, his politics and the sadness in his soul. Chernow's comments have been condensed for clarity and brevity.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what he would say about Donald Trump. I could, yes, but I don\u2019t want to guess. But we do know what he said about political figures of his own day. And he hated Teddy Roosevelt. He saw that Teddy Roosevelt had a very large ego, very self-absorbed and a Mr. Bombastic personality. But he (Twain) has a wonderful quote where he says that Teddy Roosevelt is the Tom Sawyer of the political world of the early 20th century. He said that he was always hunting for attention. And then he has this great line. He said that in his (Roosevelt's) frenzied imagination, the great republic is one vast Barnum\u2019s circus, and he is the clown, and the whole world is his audience.\u201d",
      "To actually read about the children of famous personalities is almost invariably sad, as it often is with Mark Twain. The one who suffered from this most acutely, I think was the middle daughter, Clara, who was kind of insanely competitive with her father and felt overshadowed by him, wanted to kind of trade on his reputation, but then didn\u2019t want him to get the attention. She said that she would be in a room with her father, and she felt she was only Mark Twain\u2019s daughter, that she was reduced to the level of a footstool. And she also had a very interesting line, one that has a very contemporary ring: He would come into the room and he would flood the room with talk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's that time when he goes to the Sandwich Islands and he meets the American diplomat Anson Burlingame, who advises him to \u201ccultivate your betters,\u201d which Twain really takes to heart. I think that with Twain, if someone asks me, you know, did he marry Olivia for her money? I would say definitely not. It was a true love match. And as Twain said late in life, there was not a single day of his marriage that she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I worship you,\u2019 \u2018I idolize you.\u2019 This was just kind of pouring out of her and her letters. On the other hand, the more you know about Mark Twain, the more you know that he could never have married a poor woman.",
      "\u201cAnd the irony of Twain\u2019s life is that he spends his entire life attacking the plutocrats on the one hand, and on the other, he\u2019s doing everything in his power to become one. This man embodies in his person every tendency of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of self-loathing in him. I have a quote later in the book \u2014 he says that (poet Lord) Byron detested life because he detested himself. Twain said, \u2018I\u2019m the same way.\u2019 You know, that's a really harsh, harsh thing to say. But I think that he saw all these impulses within himself that he was really powerless to stop. And then he realized he hurt other people. I think that Mark Twain did fit the stereotype of the funny man who\u2019s sad and depressed under the surface and is kind of releasing that through the humor.\u201d",

      "Robert De Niro will receive an honorary Palme d\u2019Or next week at the Cannes Film Festival, a culmination for the 81-year-old actor whose history with the French film festival stretches back half a century",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Robert De Niro will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a culmination for the 81-year-old actor whose history with the French film festival stretches back half a century.",
      "In 1976, De Niro starred in two films \u2014 Martin Scorsese's \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and Bernardo Bertolucci's \u201c1900\" \u2014 that premiered in competition at Cannes. \u201cTaxi Driver\" was an immediate sensation, and went home with the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or.",
      "Since then, De Niro has been a regular on the Croisette, returning with \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d in 1983, Sergio Leone's \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America\u201d in 1984 and Roland Joff\u00e9's \u201cThe Mission\u201d in 1986. Joff\u00e9's film also won the Palme, making De Niro the rare actor to star in two Palme d'Or winners.",
      "Though De Niro helps run his own film festival back in New York, the Tribeca Festival, he has remained a mainstay in Cannes. He presided over the jury in 2011 that selected Terrence Malick's \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d for the Palme. Most recently, he and Scorsese returned to premiere \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,\" De Niro said when his honorary Palme d'Or was announced last month. \u201cEspecially now when there\u2019s so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together \u2014 storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It\u2019s like coming home.\u201d",
      "De Niro is to receive the award in the festival's opening ceremony on May 13.",

      "The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been postponed until early next week",
      "NEW YORK -- The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was postponed until early next week, right before opening arguments begin, a federal judge decided on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Combs, 55, used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024. He pleaded not guilty after his September arrest and has remained held without bail at a federal lockup in Brooklyn.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian granted the defense lawyers' request to delay the last step in jury selection until Monday, when both sides will narrow down the pool of 45 people to 12 jurors and six alternates. Generally, lawyers do not have to explain why they are ejecting individuals from the panel.",
      "The defense said striking prospective jurors could take as little as 10 to 15 minutes, so why not do it on Monday when they will be present. The jurors weren\u2019t required to be in the Manhattan courtroom on Friday, but Combs was there.",
      "Prosecutors objected, saying the whole process could get gummed up if several jurors panic after being chosen and decide they don\u2019t want to take part in a high-profile trial that's expected to last two months.",
      "Would-be jurors were asked questions earlier this week to help the judge and lawyers determine if they could be fair and impartial. And they were also questioned to ensure they could decide the case on the facts \u2014 even after seeing explicit videos of sexual activity that some might find disturbing.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors will be permitted to strike six prospective jurors from the jury while defense lawyers were allowed 10 strikes before the jury is finalized. The process is expected to take up to an hour.",
      "If Combs is convicted on all charges, which include racketeering, kidnapping, arson, bribery and sex trafficking, he would face a mandatory 15 years in prison and could remain behind bars for life.",
      "Prosecutors allege the Bad Boy Records founder used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024.",
      "An indictment includes descriptions of \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d drugged-up orgies in which women were forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.",
      "The charges against him also portray Combs as abusive to his victims, sometimes choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "His lawyers say prosecutors are trying to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. They concede that Combs had abused various substances but say he has undergone treatment.",
      "A centerpiece of the evidence against him are recordings of Combs beating a longtime girlfriend in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.",
      "After a video of the encounter aired on CNN last year, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d",
      "Numerous prospective jurors told the judge they'd seen the video and some were deemed too affected by it to be impartial.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former model tearfully testified Thursday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point.",
      "Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, an aspiring actor at the time, told jurors at Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial that the onetime movie honcho put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at a Manhattan apartment in 2002.",
      "Sokola said she saw Weinstein\u2019s eyes \u2014 \u201cblack and scary\u201d \u2014 staring at her in a bathroom mirror as it happened.",
      "Afterward, she said, he told her to keep quiet about what had happened, touting that he'd made the careers of A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and that he could help her Hollywood dreams come true.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never been in a situation like this,\u201d Sokola testified, as riveted jurors scribbled notes. \u201cI felt stupid and ashamed and like it\u2019s my fault for putting myself in this position.\u201d",
      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",

      "\u201cSincerely,\u201d (yes, the title includes the comma) began as a collection of letters to herself, friends and loved ones but took on a deeper meaning as the Colombian American songwriter gave birth to her first child and processed her mother's recent death.

      "I felt like I was ready to do that because I\u2019ve been making music long enough that I felt that it was that time for me, and then it just so happened that, shortly after working on the album, I became pregnant, which was such a big part of being able to feel even deeper than I ever have.",
      "UCHIS: It\u2019s crazy because a lot of times I feel, and especially with this album in particular, I felt that I really made music that my future self would need, that I didn\u2019t realize I was going to need at that time.",
      "The album is actually dedicated to my mom. My mom later ended up getting diagnosed, and she\u2019s no longer here. ... And so pretty much all of the songs ended up taking on a deeper meaning to me because of that and because of it being dedicated to her. ... At the time, I might not have even realized subconsciously that I was making all of this to heal myself.",
      "UCHIS: At one point, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure each of these songs is like, this is my letter to the world, this is my letter to this person, this my letter to that, this one to myself.\u201d I tried to really conceptualize in a different way that I never have when making any other album. And then ... when my mom passed, a lot of what I had left from her is letters that she wrote to me, and so it ended up, like I said, just more and more reasons for me to realize that it was the correct title for the project.",
      "UCHIS: I never stick to one process, but one particular process that stuck out to me on a lot of the songs was that most of them were written with no music, just songs that came to me.",
      "For instance, \u201cILYSMIH\u201d \u2014 that one literally I was just recovering from labor, my son was sleeping next to me; I was still in my hospital bed when I got this idea for this song and started it, started recording it on my phone, started writing some lyrics down. ... There\u2019s one called \u201cAll I Can Say.\u201d I wrote that whole song in the car on the way to the studio. ... I try to just make beauty out of all of my experiences.",
      "UCHIS: Thematically, nature is kind of a reoccurring theme in my music because I am so inspired by nature and I feel nature is where God exists and nature is where a lot of my creativity just thrives.",
      "I feel like it just happened. Afterwards, I even thought, \u201cIs this too similar to what I\u2019ve already done?\u201d But \u2026 I just love the things that I love, and I just returned back to those nostalgic elements. I may branch out and try what people think is different sounds. Like on \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas,\u201d I did a lot of different genre-bending on \u201cSin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)\" as well, but to me, that\u2019s still nostalgic because it\u2019s still music I grew up listening to.",
      "I return a lot to things that are core memories for me. It\u2019s soothing to my nervous system. I\u2019m the person who watches the same episodes of my favorite TV shows over and over again, ... I think that\u2019s what makes it beautiful too, is to see the evolution and know that it\u2019s still true to me. It's still true to my roots in music and where I started, but an evolved version.",
      "UCHIS: After she passed, one of the first things I did was go through all of the audio messages that she had ever sent me and I was just listening to all her messages over and over, wanting to hear her voice. When I heard that one I just thought of, \u201cOh how perfect is this that the song is called \u2018Sunshine &Rain...,\u2019 and she had said, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d It was for my son that she sent that message. I thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album, considering that it\u2019s dedicated to her.",
      "I struggled a lot with whether or not I wanted to share because I\u2019m a very, very private person. So I struggled a lot with if I even wanted to share that my mom was no longer here, but I felt I just had to not be afraid of that vulnerability and not pretend like it didn\u2019t affect me or didn\u2019t have some type of impact on me when it had such a big impact on me and still does. And I wanted to also honor her and honor her life in a way through art that I know that she would have loved and that she would have been proud of.",

    "story": [
      "A scrappy opera company that started 11 years ago in New York City is thriving by staying small",
      "NEW YORK -- Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance \u2014 in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people.",
      "\u201cWe did Kurt Weill\u2019s \u2018The Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin,\u201d recalled Schlosberg, the company\u2019s music director and one of its founders.",
      "They named their company Heartbeat Opera, \u201cfrom the idea that singers would be feet away from you,\u201d Schlosberg said. \u201cAnd so you would be experiencing their voices at arm\u2019s length and that would make a resonance in your heart.\u201d",
      "Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million.",
      "But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200.",
      "\u201cVery few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale,\u201d said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeat\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe don\u2019t do small opera. We do big opera in a small space.\u201d",
      "And despite its success with critics and audiences \u2014 performances regularly sell out \u2014 the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule.",
      "There\u2019s typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians.",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly \u2014 a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse.",
      "\u201cGrowth itself shouldn\u2019t be a goal. Excellence should be a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they don\u2019t overstretch and overstep.\u201d",
      "Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesn\u2019t focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises \u201cincisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d in 2017.",
      "\u201cTheir approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world,\u201d she said, \u201cwithout falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, \u2018Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here\u2019.\u201d",
      "For Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFidelio,\u201d Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composer\u2019s own sexuality.",
      "And for Richard Strauss\u2019 \u201cSalome\u201d this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s casting for \u201cSalome\u201d reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability.",
      "Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that \u201ca big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent,\u201d he said.",
      "Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first \u201cbecause I had never done a role like this where I am the title character.",
      "\u201cI was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most striking aspect of this \u201cSalome\u201d was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s final local offering of the season will be Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust,\u201d to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25.",
      "\u201cI had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories,\u201d said Holdren, who is directing the production. \u201cAnd I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off.\u201d",
      "She sees Mephistopheles less as a \u201dmustache-twirling villain\u201d and more as \u201ca figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that there\u2019s an opening for him.\u201d",
      "Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. It\u2019s the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration.",
      "That task fell to Francisco Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct.",
      "Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cVanessa\u201d at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited by what they\u2019ve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times,\" said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival.",
      "For Heartbeat\u2019s debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. It\u2019s in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",

      "Smokey Robinson\u2019s lawyer says allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Smokey Robinson's lawyer said allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\" and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "Attorney Christopher Frost said in a statement Wednesday that the evidence \u201cwill show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.\u201d",
      "The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday against the Motown music luminary seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024. Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, is also named as a defendant for allegedly enabling his behavior and creating an abusive work environment.",
      "\u201cWe will be addressing the numerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies, and relationships between the plaintiffs and others,\u201d Frost's statement said.",
      "The four women each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them over their objections, in some cases for many years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,\u201d the women\u2019s attorney John Harris said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. The women, whose names are withheld in the lawsuit, appeared with their lawyers at the news conference. They didn't speak, and they covered their faces with masks.",
      "Frost called the news conference \u201cbizarre theatrics,\u201d and an attempt to \u201cenlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create. We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\u201d",
      "One woman said that she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said that she worked for him from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times.",
      "All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. The same fears have kept the women from going to police to report Robinson, their lawyers said, though they also said they believe criminal investigation is warranted.",
      "The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations.",
      "Frost said that Robinson would soon address the allegations himself, and that they would be asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s as a central part of the Motown Records machine \u2014 both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including \u201cTears of a Clown\" and \u201cThe Tracks of My Tears.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former model who alleges that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her almost 20 years ago has taken the stand at his retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her.",
      "But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.",
      "On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story.",
      "Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations.",
      "As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.",
      "The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors.",
      "In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.",
      "The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006.",
      "Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.",
      "She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.",
      "Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2014 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2014 but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.",
      "She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.",
      "Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.",
      "They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility\u201d of other accusers.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "U.S. health officials say a listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat sandwiches and snacks has sickened at least 10 people",
      "A listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat sandwiches and snacks has sickened at least 10 people in the U.S., and a producer is voluntarily recalling dozens of products sold to retail stores, hospitals, hotels, airports and airlines, federal officials said.",
      "The products were made by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC and were sold in Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington.",
      "Those who fell ill and were hospitalized were in California and Nevada. The outbreak has been simmering for many months: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said cases date to December 2023.",
      "Listeria poisoning is caused by a particularly resilient type of bacteria that can survive and grow even during refrigeration. About 1,600 people are infected with it \u2014 and 260 die \u2014 each year in the U.S., according to the CDC.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The voluntary recall covers more than 80 specific products distributed between April 18 and April 25. The products have \u201cUse By\u201d dates from April 22 to May 19.",
      "Brand names include: Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go and Fresh Take Crave Away.",
      "Federal officials say anyone with the products should throw them away or return them. They also suggest cleaning any surfaces that touched the recalled foods.",
      "Listeria bacteria thrive in moist environments, including soil and water and decaying vegetation and are carried by some animals.",
      "The hardy germs are typically spread when food is harvested, processed, transported or stored in places that are contaminated with the bacteria.",
      "When the bacteria get into a food processing plant, they can be tough to eradicate.",
      "Foods contaminated with the bacteria can make people sick. Symptoms can be mild and include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. More serious illness can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Listeria poisoning is tricky because symptoms can start quickly, within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. But they also can take weeks or up to three months to show up.",
      "Those most vulnerable to getting sick include the very young, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.",
      "Listeria can survive and grow in refrigerated food. It can be killed by heating foods to \u201csteaming hot,\u201d or 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius), the CDC says. But that's not always possible \u2014 or palatable \u2014 for foods that are made to be eaten cold.",
      "Because listeria can survive under refrigeration, it\u2019s important to clean and sanitize any surfaces, including refrigerator drawers and shelves, that may have come in contact with the products.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to change the pricing model for some medications is facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he\u2019s even signed an executive order he says will lower the costs of drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "LUSAKA, Zambia -- The United States will cut $50 million worth of aid a year to the southern African country of Zambia because of the \u201csystematic\" theft of medicines and medical supplies the money paid for, the U.S. ambassador said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. had discovered in 2021 that medicines and supplies that were meant to be provided free to Zambians had been taken and were being sold by pharmacies across the country, U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said at a press briefing.",
      "He said that an investigation of around 2,000 pharmacies in Zambia between 2021 and 2023 found that nearly half of them were selling medicines and products paid for by U.S. aid funds.",
      "The Zambian government had failed to do enough to address the corruption after the U.S. informed it of the theft scandal in April 2024, Gonzales said.",
      "There was no immediate government comment Thursday.",
      "The $50 million is part of $128 million the U.S. gives to Zambia a year for medicines, medical supplies and other support for its health sector. Gonzales said the cuts would affect medications for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, three critical diseases affecting Zambians.",
      "\u201cThe United States is taking necessary steps to safeguard, and ensure the accountability of, American taxpayer funds,\u201d Gonzales said.",
      "The action was separate to President Donald Trump's decision to cut U.S. foreign aid across the world, Gonzales said.",
      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

      "Cancer before age 50 is rare, but increasing, in the United States and researchers want to know why.",
      "A new government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, finding that the largest increases are in breast, colorectal, kidney and uterine cancers. Scientists from the National Cancer Institute looked at data that included more than 2 million cancers diagnosed in people 15 to 49 years old between 2010 and 2019.",
      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",
      "The findings were published Thursday in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.",
      "The researchers compared cancer rates in 2019 to what would be expected based on 2010 rates.",
      "Breast cancer made up the largest share of the excess cancers, with about 4,800 additional cases. There were 2,000 more colorectal cancers compared with what would be expected based on the 2010 rates. There were 1,800 more kidney cancers and 1,200 additional uterine cancers.",
      "Reassuringly, death rates were not rising for most cancers in the young adult age groups, although increasing death rates were seen for colorectal, uterine and testicular cancers.",
      "Explanations will take more research. The big databases used for the study don't include information on risk factors or access to care. Theories abound and a big meeting is planned later this year to bring together experts in the area.",

      "This isn't happening across the board. Cancer rates in people under 50 are going down for more than a dozen types of cancer, with the largest declines in lung and prostate cancers.",
      "Cigarette smoking has been declining for decades, which likely accounts for the drop in lung cancer among younger adults.",

      "Bill Gates is in Indonesia to discuss health and sustainable development initiatives with the leader of the world\u2019s fourth most populous country",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Bill Gates was in Indonesia on Wednesday to discuss health and sustainable development initiatives with the leader of the world\u2019s fourth most populous country.",
      "Gates met President Prabowo Subianto at the colonial-style Merdeka palace in Jakarta to discuss global health, nutrition, financial inclusion and public digital infrastructure, Indonesia\u2019s presidential office said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and Gates Foundation praised Indonesia's adoption of vaccines like Rotavirus for diarrhea and Pneumococcus for pneumonia and the country's efforts in reducing child mortality.",
      "He said ten million children under the age of five worldwide died when his foundation launched in 2000, with 90% of the deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia or malaria. That number has now been cut in half to below five million, Gates said.",
      "\u201cIt's been an amazing time period. And there\u2019s many new tools coming,\u201d he told the meeting, which was also attended by prominent Indonesian businesspeople and philanthropists.",
      "Gates' foundation is currently developing a tuberculosis vaccine that's planned to be tested in Indonesia, Subianto said.",
      "\u201cThis is crucial because TB is still a deadly disease in the country,\u201d he said.",
      "Gates said that because rich countries don\u2019t have tuberculosis, \u201cit just doesn\u2019t get hardly any money for diagnostics or drugs or vaccines.\u201d",
      "Gates has granted more than $159 million to Indonesia since 2009. Much of it was allocated to the health sector, especially for vaccine procurement, Subianto said. Thanks to the funds, Subianto said Biofarma, a state-run pharmaceutical company, now can produce two billion doses of its polio vaccine every year, benefiting more than 900 million people in 42 countries.",
      "The Gates Foundation is also planning to roll out a micronutrient supplement for pregnant women in Indonesia in coming months.",
      "Subianto said that Gates will receive Indonesia's highest honor in New York during the U.N. General Assembly in September for his services to the country.",
      "During his first in-person visit to the Indonesian capital, Gates is also scheduled to visit a primary school in eastern Jakarta where more than 500 students were taking part of the program.",
      "The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimates that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight, while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "Indonesia launched an ambitious project this year to fight malnutrition that aims to feed nearly 90 million children and pregnant women. The program is expected to cost 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) through 2029.",
      "Critics question whether it is affordable. Investors and analysts have questioned the burden on state finances and the economy, and the project's ties with the interests of industrial lobby groups.",

    "story": [
      "In Senegal\u2019s gold-rich Kedougou region, women and children face serious health risks from mercury exposure used in gold processing",
      "KEDOUGOU, Senegal -- The quickest way to separate gold from rock, Sadio Camara says, is with a drop of mercury. She empties a dime-sized packet of the silvery liquid into a plastic bucket of muddy sediment outside her home in southeastern Senegal. With bare hands and no mask, she swirls the mixture as her children look on.",
      "\u201cI know mercury isn\u2019t good for your health \u2014 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t drink the water it comes into contact with,\u201d she said. \u201cI only process small amounts of gold, so there\u2019s no danger.\u201d",
      "But even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks.",
      "Across West Africa, mercury \u2014 a potent neurotoxin \u2014 remains the dominant method for extracting gold from ore in the region\u2019s booming informal mining sector, much of it illegal and unregulated. In Senegal\u2019s gold-rich Kedougou region, women like Camara use the metal regularly, often without protective gloves and masks, to make a living.",
      "Mercury exposure can cause irreversible brain damage, developmental delays, tremors and loss of vision, hearing and coordination. Once released, it spreads easily through air, water and soil. Particularly after heavy rains, it contaminates rivers, poisons fish and accumulates up the food chain.",
      "A 2018 Duke University-led study found mercury levels in soils, sediments and water near artisanal gold mining villages in southeastern Senegal that exceeded safety thresholds set by the World Health Organization and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by 10 to 100 times.",
      "In artisanal mining, mercury is prized for its ability to bind quickly and easily to gold. Miners mix the liquid metal into crushed ore, and the mixture is then heated \u2014 often over open flames \u2014 to evaporate the mercury and leave behind a lump of gold. The process is cheap, effective and dangerous.",
      "\u201cIf it hurt right away, like a knife, people would stop. But the issue is that it takes years for the dangers to manifest,\u201d said Doudou Dram\u00e9, president of the Observatoire Territoriale du Secteur Extractif, an organization that advocates for safer conditions for gold miners in Kedougou. \u201cPeople are dumping it directly into the river. They\u2019re burning it in the open, releasing toxic smoke into the air. It\u2019s extremely dangerous.\u201d",
      "Artisanal and small-scale gold mining is the largest global source of mercury emissions, even more than the burning of coal, according to the UN Environment Programme. In Senegal alone, artisanal mines are estimated to release between 12 and 16 metric tons of mercury each year.",
      "\u201cKedougou has rich land \u2014 very rich land,\u201d Dram\u00e9 said. \u201cNow mercury is everywhere. Our animals consume it, and it comes back to us. Even the soil is no longer fertile.\u201d",
      "Along the muddy banks of a rust-colored pond, dozens of women wade knee-deep as they rinse piles of sediment in search of gold. Children dart between mounds of earth while the runoff pools around their feet. With little access to clean water, many women spend long hours in local waterways to work, bathe their children, wash clothes and clean dishes.",
      "\u201cWomen are much more exposed than men,\u201d said Modou Goumbala, the monitoring and evaluation manager at La Lumiere, an NGO that supports community development in southeastern Senegal.",
      "That exposure can be especially dangerous for pregnant and nursing women. Mercury can cross the placenta, putting fetuses at risk of developmental delays and birth defects. Infants may also absorb the toxin through contaminated breast milk.",
      "Inside her kitchen hut not far from the stream, Camara heats a nugget of mercury-laced sediment with a metal spoon over an open flame. The toxic metal evaporates and leaves behind a kernel of gold. There\u2019s no mask, no gloves \u2014 just the raw materials and her bare hands. Her children stand just a few feet away, watching and breathing the fumes.",
      "Camara said she doesn\u2019t usually handle the burning herself; that task is typically left to men. But she and other women regularly mix and shape the mercury amalgam with no protection. One of her children suffers from frequent stomachaches, though she hasn\u2019t noticed any other symptoms. Still, the risks loom.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way to earn money today is gold mining,\u201d Camara said. \u201cSubsistence agriculture will not provide you enough for food or other needs.\u201d",
      "In Senegal, gold processors like Camara typically process between 5 and 10 grams of gold per month, earning the equivalent of $370 to $745 \u2014 more than double the national average salary of about $200.",
      "Senegal ratified the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2016, pledging to reduce mercury use and pollution. But the substance remains widely accessible. Most of the country\u2019s supply comes from Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana, with smaller amounts smuggled from dental clinics in Dakar, according to a 2022 report by the Institute for Security Studies.",
      "In 2020, the government promised to build 400 mercury-free gold processing units. So far, only one has been constructed \u2014 in Bantaco, about 15 miles from Camara\u2019s home. The facility uses gravity to separate gold from ore, eliminating the need for mercury by relying on sluices and shaking tables.",
      "During a recent visit, the rusting slab of metal sat unused beneath a corrugated roof.",
      "\u201cPeople used it for a while, but then they stopped, because one single unit can\u2019t cover an entire community,\u201d Goumbala said. \u201cNaturally, those who were nearby could use it. But for those who are very far away, they can\u2019t afford to transport the ore all the way, process it and then go back. It\u2019s extra work. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "Camara said she tried the unit, but in addition to being far away, it was less effective at isolating gold \u2013 some was lost in the process.",
      "Repeated efforts to schedule an interview with Senegal\u2019s director of artisanal and small-scale mining were unsuccessful. The director later said the department had been suspended. He did not provide a reason.",
      "Senegal swore in a new president in 2024, but residents say the problems remain.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a new administration in place, but promises are still just promises,\u201d Goumbala said. He believes the lack of progress is due to limited funding.",
      "In an effort to curb pollution, authorities temporarily suspended mining within 500 meters (1,640 feet)of the Faleme River, which cuts through Senegal\u2019s gold belt and forms part of the border with Mali.",
      "But enforcement is weak as officials struggle to stem the influx of informal miners, many of whom arrive from neighboring countries. Critics say the measure barely scratches the surface of the problem.",
      "\u201cThe solution is to install the gold processing units within the communities \u2014 at least one per village,\u201d Goumbala said.",
      "Even so, he acknowledged the challenges: The machines are expensive, difficult to maintain and require replacement parts that are only available abroad.",
      "There\u2019s also resistance among miners, who say mercury is more efficient and profitable.",
      "\u201cWe need to convince communities that even if they make more money using mercury, in the end, they\u2019ll spend that profit on treating illnesses caused by it,\u201d Goumbala said. \u201cThe long-term consequences are far worse.\u201d",

      "Neither the military government nor state-controlled media have released information about the reported airstrike.",
      "The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter a widespread armed struggle against its rule, which began in February 2021 when it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since then, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.",
      "A member of the White Depeyin People's Defence Force resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that a fighter jet dropped a bomb directly onto a school, where many students from primary to high school levels were studying after 9 a.m. The area is about 115 kilometers (70 miles) northwest of Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city.",
      "The resistance fighter, who rushed to the site of the attack to help the victims, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was afraid of being arrested by the military. He said that 20 students and two teachers were killed in the attack on the school, which is operated by the country\u2019s pro-democracy movement, and about 50 others were wounded. Three nearby houses were damaged.",
      "He also said that there had been no recent fighting in the area, though Sagaing is a stronghold of the resistance.",
      "Nay Phone Latt, a spokesperson for the opposition\u2019s National Unity Government, told the AP that he received the same information on the number of casualties, and that the death toll could rise. The organization is the main opposition group coordinating resistance to military rule.",
      "He accused the military of deliberately attacking civilians in monasteries, refugee camps, schools and hospitals, with the excuse that resistance fighters were sheltering at such sites, though this was not the case and the bombings were intended to alienate the people from the resistance movement.",
      "The death tolls from Monday's bombing reported by independent Myanmar media ranged from 17 to more than 20. A volunteer in Tabayin assisting displaced people who asked not to be identified because of fear of government reprisals said he received the information from the ground that 12 students were confirmed dead and around 30-50 others were wounded.",
      "Sagaing region, near the border with India, has been a stronghold of armed resistance, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes against the local pro-democracy People's Defense Forces. The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks.",

The initial explosion was shortly followed by another blast, said Maj. Gen. Kristomei Sianturi, the Indonesian military spokesperson.",
      "Nine civilians and four army members were killed, Sianturi said, adding that several other people were being treated for various injuries.",
      "The cause of the incident is still being investigated, with a focus on whether the standard procedure for ammunition disposal was followed, Sianturi said. The location \u2014 vacant land under the management of West Java\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Agency \u2014 is far from residential areas and often used for munitions disposal.",
      "However, such activities often attract the attention of nearby residents, who often take metal fragments, copper or scrap iron from grenades and mortars, Sianturi said, \u201cAnd there might be an unexpected second explosion after that.\u201d",
      "Local television footage showed an explosion lighting up the sky and thick black smoke, followed by a second blast a few minutes later. Another video showed ambulances evacuating the injured victims and the dead.",

      "A German charity says four people, including two small children, have died during a migration voyage in the Mediterranean",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Four people, including two small children, have died during a migration voyage in the Mediterranean, a German charity involved in their rescue said.",
      "The nonprofit group RESQSHIP said that dozens of migrants had departed western Libya on a flimsy rubber boat with a failing engine. Three days later, on Saturday afternoon, the group's civilian vessel NADIR found 62 of them in international waters where Malta is responsible for search and rescue.",
      "By the time the group reached them, two children aged 3 and 4 were dead and a third person was found unconscious and died, it said. Survivors also reported that a fourth person had drowned during the journey.",
      "An Italian coast guard vessel arrived four hours later, according to the German charity, and evacuated six people in critical condition, including two babies and their mothers, as their boat was already full with other rescued migrants. The rest of the survivors, many suffering from skin burns caused by the harmful mixture of sea water and fuel, were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa.",
      "\u201cThis tragedy could have been avoided. It is yet another example of the failure of European migration policies,\u201d RESQSHIP said in a statement. \u201cInstead of coordinating support and facilitating safe passages, Europe is abandoning defenceless people \u2013 with deadly consequences. Children dying of thirst on the move is an inexcusable political failure.\u201d",
      "Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the Maltese Armed Forces did not immediately return questions sent by email from The Associated Press.",
      "The Mediterranean Sea is the world's deadliest migration route with nearly 32,000 recorded fatalities since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration. This year alone, at least 565 migrants have died on the sea crossing to Europe.",

      "A dilapidated industrial site in the Czech Republic where German businessman Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews during the World War II is coming back to life",
      "BRNENEC, Czech Republic -- A dilapidated industrial site in the Czech Republic where German businessman Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews during the World War II is coming back to life.",
      "The site, a former textile factory in the town of Brn\u011bnec, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of Prague, was stolen by the Nazis from its Jewish owners in 1938 and turned into a concentration camp. This weekend it welcomed the first visitors to the Museum of Survivors dedicated to the Holocaust and the history of Jews in this part of Europe.",
      "The opening was timed to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. It was also in May 1945 that Schindler received a golden ring from grateful Jewish survivors, made with gold taken from their teeth. The ring was inscribed with the Hebrew words from Talmud, saying \u201cWhoever saves one life saves the world entire.\"",
      "Schindler\u2019s story was told in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Oscar-winning movie, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\"",
      "Daniel L\u00f6w-Beer was a driving force behind the project. His predecessors lived in this part of Czech Republic for hundreds of years, acquiring the plant in Brnenec in 1854 and turning it into one of Europe's most important wool factories.",
      "\u201cWe had to flee for our lives, lost a bit of our history, so putting a little bit of history back to a place and hopefully bringing out as well the history of Oskar Schindler and the village is what we\u2019re doing today,\u201d L\u00f6w-Beer told The Associated Press.",
      "Today, his family members are scattered around the world. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to put a little bit, of course emotionally, of my family back in the place because they were survivors. My grandfather lived here, my father lived here, and then the world was shattered one day in 1938,\" he said.",
      "The museum, housed in part of a renovated spinning mill, displays the history of Schindler, his wife Emilie, the L\u00f6w-Beer family and others linked to the area, together with the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. It includes a space for exhibitions, lectures, film screenings and concerts, as well as a caf\u00e9.",
      "A transparent glass wall between this part and the bigger, still ruined area behind it separates the present and history.",
      "\"It\u2019s a universal place of survivors,\u201d L\u00f6w-Beer said. \u201cWe want those stories to be told and people to make their own opinions.\u201d",
      "In 2019 L\u00f6w-Beer set up the Arks Foundation to buy the warehouse and turn it into a museum, investing money and renewing a partnership with the local community to revive the neglected site.",
      "The regional government contributed funds, while a grant from the European Union brought children from five European countries to Brn\u011bnec to come up with ideas that helped shape the museum design.",
      "The official opening on the weekend completed the first step but a lot remains to be done. The remaining buildings are still waiting to be fully restored. They include Schindler\u2019s office where the town hall plans to create an information center, the barracks of the SS troops, which will provide more exhibition spaces, and the entire building of Schindler\u2019s Ark where the Jewish prisoners lived and worked.",
      "Currently, the museum is not open on a daily basis and focuses on education activities for schools.",
      "Previous projects to restore the site failed due to a lack of funds. In contrast, the Arks Foundation took a step-by-step approach. When skeptical local residents could see something was really happening this time, they offered help. A firm came with a big truck loaded with bricks, dropped them and just went off, L\u00f6w-Beer said.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to show that you have to do something for something else to happen,\u201d said Milan \u0160udoma of the foundation. If organizers had waited until they had secured all the necessary funding, nothing would likely be done by now, he said.",
      "\u201cOskar and Emilie Schindler are proof that one person can make a difference,\u201d the museum quotes Rena Finder, one of the Schindler\u2019s Jews, as saying. \u201cEverybody said there was nothing I could do. And that\u2019s a lie because there is always something you can do.\u201d",
      "Schindler, an unlikely hero, was born in the nearby town of Svitavy (Zwittau in German) in what was then the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, with a German-speaking majority and a substantial Jewish population.",
      "A Svitavy museum said Schindler was a mass of contradictions: a troublemaker, a womanizer, a spy for the Germans, a Nazi but also a man who saved people from the Holocaust.",
      "After the war broke out in 1939, Schindler moved from Svitavy to Krakow, now Poland, where he ran an enamel and ammunition plant and treated Jewish workers well. With the Red Army approaching in 1944, he created a list of Jewish workers he claimed were needed to resettle the plant in Brn\u011bnec.",
      "When a transport with 300 women was diverted to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, Schindler managed to secure their release.",
      "Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem, said it\u2019s the only known case \u201cthat such a large group of people were allowed to leave alive while the gas chambers were still in operation.\u201d",
      "In another bold act, Emilie Schindler led an effort to save more than 100 Jewish male prisoners who arrived at a nearby train station in sealed cattle wagons in January 1945.",
      "In 1993, Yad Vashem recognized Emilie and Oskar Schindler as Righteous Among the Nations, the honor awarded to those who rescued Jews from the Holocaust.",

      "Leo received a standing ovation as he entered the Vatican auditorium for his first meeting with representatives of the general public.",
      "The 69-year-old Augustinian missionary, elected in a 24-hour conclave last week, called for journalists to use words for peace, to reject war and to give voice to the voiceless.",
      "He expressed solidarity with journalists around the world who have been jailed for trying to seek and report the truth. Drawing applause from the crowd, he asked for their release.",
      "\u201cThe church recognises in these witnesses \u2014 I am thinking of those who report on war even at the cost of their lives \u2014 the courage of those who defend dignity, justice and the right of people to be informed, because only informed individuals can make free choices,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe suffering of these imprisoned journalists challenges the conscience of nations and the international community, calling on all of us to safeguard the precious gift of free speech and of the press.\u201d",
      "Leo opened the meeting with a few words in English, joking that if the crowd was still awake and applauding at the end, it mattered more than the ovation that greeted him.",
      "Turning to Italian, he thanked the journalists for their work covering the papal transition and urged them to use words of peace.",
      "\u201cPeace begins with each one of us: in the way we look at others, listen to others and speak about others,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this sense, the way we communicate is of fundamental importance: we must say \u2018no\u2019 to the war of words and images, we must reject the paradigm of war.\u201d",
      "After his brief speech, in which he reflected on the power of words to do good, he greeted some of the journalists in the front rows and then shook hands with the crowd as he exited the audience hall down the central aisle. He signed a few autographs and posed for a few selfies.",
      "Journalists later shared some of the few words they exchanged with him, including hints that Vatican plans are going ahead for Leo to travel to Turkey to commemorate an important event in Catholic-Orthodox relations: the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council.",
      "Other tidbits emerged: Journalists offered to play doubles in tennis, or to organize a charity match. Leo, a regular tennis player, seemed game \u201cbut we can\u2019t invite Sinner,\u201d he joked, referring to the world No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is playing just up the Tiber at the Italian Open.",
      "It was in the 2013 audience with journalists who covered the election of history's first Latin American pope that Pope Francis explained his choice of name, after St. Francis of Assisi, and his desire for a \u201cchurch which is poor and for the poor!\u201d",
      "During his 12-year pontificate, Francis too spoke about the value of journalism and as recently as January, he appealed for the release of imprisoned journalists during a Holy Year event with the media.",

      "While Labor prime ministers allocate the ministerial portfolios, the party\u2019s factional leaders pick the 30 lawmakers who will get them based on the proportion of seats each faction won.",
      "The factional leaders dropped former Industry and Science Minister Husic, who was born in Sydney to Bosnian Muslim immigrants, and former Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish.",
      "Husic, who after the 2022 election became Australia\u2019s first federal minister to be sworn into office on a Quran, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday that Albanese should have intervened to keep him and Dreyfus in Cabinet.",
      "Husic said his demotion was in part punishment for his views on how Israel has waged war in Gaza.",

      "Bilal Rauf, an adviser to the Australian National Imams Council, called for Albanese to explain whether Husic\u2019s demotion was due to his views on Gaza.",
      "\u201cI think at a minimum, some explanation is warranted. We can\u2019t just leave it at explanations about factionalism,\u201d Rauf said.",
      "\u201cIf Ed says that\u2019s a factor, I have no reason to discount that,\u201d Rauf said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to deny that it likely is a factor.\u201d",
      "Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said his advocacy group had enjoyed good relations with both Dreyfus and Husic.",

The movie suffers a bloody nose at the Oscars. Depardieu categorically denies saying he took part in rape. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous at 9 years old or at any age,\u201d he told the French newspaper Le Monde. \u201cYes, one can say I had sexual experiences when I was very young, but a rape, never. I respect women too much.\u201d",

      "2023: His wax figure is removed from Paris\u2019 most famous wax museum following negative reactions from visitors over allegations about his conduct with women.

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East this week as scheduled won\u2019t include a visit to Israel to discuss the war in Gaza, or talks with Iran about its nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- On his trip this week to the Middle East, U.S. President Donald Trump will visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, though his most pressing regional challenges concern two other countries: Israel and Iran.",
      "After ending a ceasefire two months ago, Israel is intensifying the war in the Gaza Strip, where a blockade on food, medicine and other supplies is worsening a humanitarian crisis. And Iran, an enemy of Israel and a rival of Saudi Arabia, stands on the cusp of being able to develop nuclear weapons.",
      "Yet Trump will focus his attention on three energy-rich nations home to existing or planned Trump-branded real estate projects \u2014 places where he aims to leverage American economic interests to do what he personally revels in: making business deals.",
      "\u201cThis is his happy place,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, a senior vice president at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cHis hosts will be generous and hospitable. They\u2019ll be keen to make deals. They\u2019ll flatter him and not criticize him. And they\u2019ll treat his family members as past and future business partners.\u201d",
      "But Trump won\u2019t be able to avoid altogether diplomacy on Gaza or Iran: The Gulf countries hosting him are also interested in easing the regional tensions that emanate from these two places.",
      "\u201cTrump can easily score a win by reassuring them of America\u2019s strategic commitment to the region, demonstrating consistent messaging and generally rising above the fray,\u201d analysts Elizabeth Dent and Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote Friday.",
      "By not scheduling a trip to Israel during his first trip to the region during his second term as president, Trump is reinforcing a feeling in Israel that its interests may not be top of mind for him.",
      "That sense intensified last week, when Trump announced that the U.S. would halt its strikes on the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group in Yemen that agreed to stop its attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea.",
      "The Houthis' attacks on Israel did not appear to be covered by that deal, which came as a surprise to Israel, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic issue. Days after the deal between the U.S. and the Houthis \u2014 and despite a two-day Israeli assault on Houthi targets \u2014 a missile from Yemen again set off air raid sirens in Israel. Then Israel's military warned Sunday that Houthi-controlled ports in Yemen could be targeted again.",
      "Trump's move to launch negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program also jarred Israel, which fears a deal that would not be strict enough to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon or rein in its support for regional militant groups.",
      "Israel had hoped that Trump might provide military assistance in any strike it carried out on the country's nuclear facilities \u2014 an action that is unrealistic so long as there are negotiations, or if they reach a deal.",
      "That has raised questions in Israel over Trump's reliability on other major issues, like a long-sought normalization deal with Saudi Arabia as part of any defense pact the administration may reach with the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has said it would only normalize ties with Israel in exchange for significant concessions for the Palestinians toward statehood, something the current Israeli government is unlikely to agree to.",
      "Israel has said it will hold off on expanding the war in Gaza until after Trump's visit, leaving the window open for a new ceasefire deal to materialize. And while Hamas and Trump announced that the last living American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, will be freed as part of efforts to establish a ceasefire, it is not clear what involvement Israel had in that deal.",
      "Still, Trump has given Israel free rein in Gaza and, like Israel, blames Hamas for any civilian casualties.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee played down any significance to Trump's decision not to visit the country, saying in interviews with Israeli media that his visit to the region was focused on economic issues.",
      "For Iran, much depends on the talks it is having with the U.S. over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.

      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi traveled over the weekend to both Saudi Arabia and Qatar ahead of Trump\u2019s trip.

      "The Islamic Republic is running out of options. Its economy has cratered since Trump in 2018 unilaterally pulled America out of their initial nuclear deal with world powers. And Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d \u2014 a group of aligned nations and militant groups, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon \u2014 has been mauled since the Israel-Hamas war began.",

      "Human Rights Watch says at least 100 civilians in Burkina Faso were killed by government forces near the town of Solenzo in the western Boucle du Mouhoun region in an attack in March",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- At least 100 civilians were killed by Burkina Faso government forces in March near the western town of Solenzo, Human Rights Watch said Monday.",
      "According to victim testimony and videos shared on social media gathered by the rights group, the attackers were Burkina Faso special forces and members of a pro-government militia, the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland. The victims were all ethnic Fulani, a pastoralist community that is widespread across the region, which the government has long accused of supporting Muslim militants.",
      "An earlier report from Human Rights Watch stated that the government's involvement was likely, because of video evidence on social media, although the findings were not definitive. The government issued a sharp denial when first reports surfaced, saying in a statement it \u201ccondemned the propagation, on social media, of images inducing hate and community violence, and fake information aimed at undermining social cohesion\u201d in the country.",
      "\u201cThe viral videos of the atrocities by pro-government militias near Solenzo sent shock waves through Africa\u2019s Sahel region, but they told only part of the story,\u201d said Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cFurther research uncovered that Burkina Faso\u2019s military was responsible for these mass killings of Fulani civilians, which were followed by deadly reprisals by an Islamist armed group. The government needs to impartially investigate these deaths and prosecute all those responsible.\u201d",
      "Burkina Faso authorities did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the group's new report.",
      "The landlocked nation of 23 million people has symbolized the security crisis in the arid Sahel region south of the Sahara in recent years. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, and the governments fighting them.",
      "The military junta, which took power in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2.1 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive.",
      "The attack in the western Boucle du Mouhoun region, including Solenzo and other towns, began on Feb. 27 and lasted until April 2, involving hundreds of government troops and drones, according to eyewitnesses quoted in the report.",
      "\u201cThe VDPs shot at us like animals, while drones were flying over our heads. Many women and children died because they could not run,\u201d said a Fulani herder, 44, from Solenzo, referring to the pro-government militias.",
      "After the attack, hundreds of Fulani residents fled across the border into neighboring Mali, the report said.",
      "\u201cToday, in the whole province, there are no more Fulani \u2014 they all fled or were killed or taken hostage,\u201d said a 53-year-old man from Solenzo. \u201cBut the other (ethnic) communities remain.\u201d",
      "After the government forces left, the report said that jihadist fighters from a group known as JNIM reentered the towns and carried out reprisal killings against residents, targeting the men whom it considered to be military collaborators.",
      "\u201cAll the men had been executed in front of the health center,\u201d said a 60-year-old woman who witnessed JNIM abuses in Tiao village, a town to the northeast of Solenzo on April 5. \u201cI counted up to 70 bodies.\u201d",
      "According to analysts, the junta\u2019s strategy of military escalation, including mass recruitment of civilians for poorly trained militia units, has exacerbated tensions between ethnic groups.",
      "It it impossible to get an accurate picture of the situation in the country since the military leadership has installed a system of de facto censorship, rights groups said, and those daring to speak up can be openly abducted, imprisoned or forcefully drafted into the army.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Even though he is detained in The Hague, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is among the candidates vying for some 18,000 national and local seats in Monday's midterm elections that analysts say will decide if he and his family continue to hold political power.",
      "Duterte has been in custody of the International Criminal Court since March, awaiting trial for crimes against humanity over a brutal war on illegal drugs that has left thousands of suspects dead during his presidency 2016-2022. It hasn't stopped him from running for mayor of his southern Davao city stronghold.",
      "Under Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges, including those in detention, can run for office unless they have been convicted and have exhausted all appeals.",
      "Duterte is widely expected to win as Davao mayor, a position he held for over two decades before becoming president. It's less clear how he can practically serve as mayor from behind bars.",
      "Over 68 million Filipinos have registered to vote Monday for half of the 24-member Senate, all the 317 seats in the House of Representatives and various positions in provinces, cities and municipalities. The spotlight is on the race for the Senate that could determine the political future of Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.",
      "She faces an impeachment trial in the Senate in July over accusations of plotting to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and corruption involving her office\u2019s intelligence funds. She has denied the allegations, saying they were spread by her political opponents to destroy her.",
      "Sara Duterte is considered a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race. But if convicted by the Senate, she will be removed as vice president and disqualified from holding public office. To be acquitted, she needs at least nine of 24 senators to vote in her favor.",
      "\u201cThe 2025 midterm elections will be crucial, because the results will set the pace for what will happen next, which family or faction will dominate the elections in 2028,\u201d said Maria Ela Atienza, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines.",
      "If Sara Duterte is convicted in the impeachment trial, it could signal the end of the Duterte family holding key positions in the country, she said. Other family members running in the election include Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao who is now running for vice mayor. His eldest son Paolo is seeking reelection as a member of the House of Representatives. Two grandsons are also running in local races.",
      "The impeachment and Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and transfer to the tribunal in The Hague came after Marcos and Sara Duterte's ties unraveled over political differences and their competing ambitions.",
      "\u201cThis election will decide the future of our country,\u201d Sara Duterte said in a rally in Manila last week, where she campaigned for the family-backed senatorial candidates and criticized the Marcos administration. \u201cYour vote will decide if we can continue reforms or continue to slide to our doom.\u201d",
      "Her father\u2019s spiritual adviser and close political ally, televangelist Apollo Quiboloy, is also running for a Senate seat despite being detained on charges of sexual abuse and human trafficking. He is also wanted in the U.S. on similar charges.",
      "The vote will last until 7 p.m. Monday. Some voters complained their names were missing from the list of voters in their precinct, while others grumbled about the long queue amid the stifling heat.",
      "Voter Reymark Marquez said the Marcos-Duterte team that won in 2022 failed to deliver on promises. He said the midterm elections are \u201cbeyond Duterte versus Marcos but about choosing the right leaders.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think what is at stake in this election is the future of the next generation,\u201d Diana Joy Acosta, a 32-year-old new mother, said after casting her vote in a school in metropolitan Manila\u2019s Mandaluyong City. For her baby\u2019s future, she hopes for an end to corruption and the election of politicians with integrity.",

      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will on Monday unveil plans to tighten immigration rules, confronting an issue that has bedeviled successive governments and fueled the rise of a new anti-immigrant party that could threaten the country\u2019s political establishment.",
      "Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party won a landslide victory last July, is facing pressure from voters who are increasingly frustrated by high levels of immigration that many believe have strained public services and inflamed ethnic tensions in some parts of the country.",
      "Starmer is pledging to end what his office described as \u201cBritain\u2019s failed experiment in open borders,\u2019\u2019 less than two weeks after Reform UK rode the immigration issue to victories in local elections. Labour and the center-right Conservatives, long the dominant parties in British politics, both saw their support crater in the contests for local government councils and mayors.",
      "\u201cEvery area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control. Enforcement will be tougher than ever and migration numbers will fall,\u2019\u2019 Starmer said in excerpts of a speech to be delivered on Monday. \u201cWe will create a system that is controlled, selective and fair.\u2019\u2019",
      "Immigration has been a potent issue in Britain since 2004, when the European Union expanded to Eastern Europe. While most EU countries restricted immigration from the new member states for a period of years, the U.K. immediately opened its labor market, attracting a flood of new arrivals.",
      "By 2010, then-Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to cut annual net immigration to less than 100,000, a target four Conservative governments failed to meet. In 2016, anger over the government\u2019s inability to control immigration from the EU triggered a referendum in which Britain voted to leave the bloc.",
      "But Brexit did nothing to reduce the number of people entering the country on visas for work, education and family reunification.",
      "In recent years, concerns that the government has lost control of Britain\u2019s borders have been fueled by the sight of thousands of migrants entering the U.K. illegally on leaky, inflatable boats operated by people smugglers. Some 37,000 people crossed the English Channel on small boats last year, down from 45,755 in 2022, government statistics show.",
      "Reform's performance in the local elections was \u201cbecause people are raging, furious, about the levels of both legal and illegal immigration,\u201d Deputy Party Leader Richard Tice told Sky News.",
      "Annual net migration \u2014 the number of people entering the U.K. minus those who left \u2014 stood at 728,000 in the year to June 2024. While that figure was down 20% from the year to June 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics, it was still more than seven times the target set by the Conservatives in 2010.",
      "Starmer\u2019s government doesn\u2019t plan to set a new target, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who is in charge of immigration, said on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take that really failed approach, because I think what we need to do is rebuild credibility and trust in the whole system,\u201d she said in an interview with Sky News.",
      "Instead, she said, the government will focus on policies such as restricting visas for lower-skilled workers. The new rules will mean 50,000 fewer visas for these workers next year, Cooper said.",
      "Chris Philp, Cooper\u2019s Conservative counterpart, said his party will support such proposals but they don\u2019t go far enough.",
      "\u201cTomorrow we intend to push to a vote in Parliament a measure that would have an annual cap on migration voted for and set by Parliament to restore proper democratic accountability, because those numbers were far, far too high,\u201d he said.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says a new software update prevented a third radar outage over the last two weeks at New Jersey's busy Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again over the weekend",
      "A new software update prevented a third radar outage in the last two weeks at New Jersey's busy Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again over the weekend, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday.",
      "At a news conference, Duffy also said the recent problems that have led to hundreds of cancellations and delays in Newark could have been avoided had action been taken by President Joe Biden's administration to better equip the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia \u2014 particularly after issues with the hardware in October and November that should have set off alarms.",
      "Duffy said the update the Federal Aviation Administration installed Friday night helped ensure the backup system worked on Sunday when there was another problem with the primary line coming into the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia. When a similar issue happened Friday and on April 28, the radar and communications systems went offline briefly, leaving controllers unable to see or talk to the planes.",
      "The FAA restricted traffic into Newark Liberty International Airport after the first incident, partly because several air traffic controllers went out on trauma leave afterward, worsening the already short staffing. Those limits, designed to keep flights safe, combined with an ongoing runway construction project in Newark, led to all the cancellations and delays. Later this week, the FAA will meet with all the airlines to discuss making those limits last into the summer.",
      "Even though the radar system stayed online Sunday, controllers were worried because of the two previous outages, so Duffy said they stopped all traffic at Newark airport for about 45 minutes as a precaution.",
      "Duffy said he will request an investigation into last year's move of Newark air traffic controllers from New York to Philadelphia to determine why more wasn't done to ensure there wouldn't be problems. Philadelphia is about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southwest of Newark.",
      "\u201cThe Biden-Buttigieg FAA bungled this move without properly hardening the telecom lines feeding the data, which was already well-known to be error-prone,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cWithout addressing the underlying infrastructure, they added more risk to the system.\u201d",
      "Duffy also said the FAA should have set up a new radar system for Newark in Philadelphia instead of piping the signal in from New York for controllers.",
      "Duffy and President Donald Trump have said that the problems in Newark are a prime example of why they developed a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul that nation's air traffic control system, unveiled last week. Duffy blames the Biden administration for failing to do that, but those problems go back decades, even before the first Trump administration.",
      "An advisor to former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Duffy should spend more time trying to deal with the nation's problems, and he defended the Biden administration's efforts to bolster air traffic controller hiring and make a down payment on dealing with some of the infrastructure problems.",
      "\u201cSecretary Duffy has a tough job. But he needs to spend more time doing what the American people are paying him to do \u2014 fix problems \u2014 and less time blaming others,\" said Chris Meagher.",
      "Duffy laid out an extensive plan to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system last week, including installing 4,600 new high-speed data connections and replacing 618 radars, but didn't put a price tag on the plan other than to say it will cost billions.",
      "The FAA has installed new fiber optic lines at Newark airport and New York's Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports to replace old copper wires since the first outage, but plans to spend the next two weeks testing those new lines out before switching over to them.",

      "NEW YORK -- American businesses that rely on Chinese goods reacted with muted relief Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause their exorbitant tariffs on each other's products for 90 days.",
      "Importers still face relatively high tariffs, however, as well as uncertainty over what will happen in the coming weeks and months. Many businesses delayed or canceled orders after President Donald Trump last month put a 145% tariff on items made in China.",
      "Now, they\u2019re concerned a mad scramble to get goods onto ships will lead to bottlenecks and increased shipping costs. The temporary truce was announced as retailers and their suppliers are looking to finalize their plans and orders for the holiday shopping season.",
      "\u201cThe timing couldn\u2019t have been any worse with regard to placing orders, so turning on a dime to pick back up with customers and our factories will put us severely behind schedule,\u201d said WS Game Company owner Jonathan Silva, whose Massachusetts business creates deluxe versions of Monopoly, Scrabble and other Hasbro board games.",
      "Silva said the 30% tariff on Chinese imports still is a step in the right direction. He has nine containers of products waiting at factories in China and said he would work to get them exported at the lower rate.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to lower its 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods by 115 percentage points, while China agreed to lower its retaliatory 125% rate on U.S. goods by the same amount. The two sides plan to continue negotiations on a longer-term trade deal.",
      "National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay said the move was a \u201ccritical first step to provide some short-term relief for retailers and other businesses that are in the midst of ordering merchandise for the winter holiday season.\u201d",
      "The news sent the stock market and the value of the dollar soaring, a lift that eluded business owners confronting another dizzying shift.",
      "Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois, invested millions of dollars to develop a line of $1,000 ergonomic chairs but delayed production in China that was set to begin this month, hoping for a tariff reprieve.",
      "Rosenberg said it was good U.S.-China trade talks were ongoing but that he thinks the 90-day window is \u201cbeyond dangerous\u201d since shipping delays could result in his chairs still being en route when the temporary deal ends.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be a plan in place that lasts a year or two so people can plan against it,\u201d he said.",
      "Jeremy Rice, the co-owner of a Lexington, Kentucky, home-d\u00e9cor shop that specializes in artificial flower arrangements, said the limited pause makes him unsure how to approach pricing. About 90% of the flowers House uses are made in China. He stocked up on inventory and then paused shipments in April.",
      "\u201cOur vendors are still kind of running around juggling, not knowing what they\u2019re gonna do,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe ordered in what we could pre-tariff and so there\u2019s stock here, but we\u2019re getting to the point now where there\u2019s things that are gone and we\u2019re going to have to figure out how we\u2019re gonna approach it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no relief,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of like you\u2019re just waiting for the next shoe to drop.\u201d",
      "Before Trump started the latest U.S. tariff battle with China, Miami-based game company All Things Equal was preparing to launch its first electronic board game. Founder Eric Poses said he spent two years developing The Good News Is..., a fill-in-the-blank game covering topics like politics and sports. He plowed $120,000 into research and development.",
      "When the president in February added a 20% tariff on products made in China, Poses started removing unessential features such as embossed packaging. When the rate went up to 145%, he faced two options: leave the goods in China or send them to bonded warehouses, a storage method which allow importers to defer duty payments for up to five years.",
      "Poses contacted his factories in China on Monday to arrange the deferred shipments, but with his games still subject to a 30% tariff, he said he would have to cut back on marketing to keep the electronic game priced at $29.99. With other businesses also in a rush to get their products, he said he is worried he won't be able to his into shipping containers and that if he does, the cost will be much more expensive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to plan because if you want to go back to production in a couple of months, then you\u2019re worried about what will the tariff rate be when it hits the U.S. ports after that 90-day period,\u201d Poses said.",
      "Jim Umlauf\u2019s business, 4Knines, based in Oklahoma City, makes vehicle seat covers and cargo liners for dog owners and others. He imports raw materials such as fabric, coatings and components from China.",
      "Umlauf said that even with a lower general tariff rate, it's hard for small businesses to make a profit. He thinks the U.S. government should offer small business exclusions from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cI appreciate any progress being made on the tariff front, but unfortunately, we\u2019re still far from a real solution \u2014 especially for small businesses like mine,\u201d Umlauf said. \u201cWhen tariffs exceed 50%, there\u2019s virtually no profit left unless we dramatically raise prices \u2014 an option that risks alienating customers.\u201d",
      "Zou Guoqing, a Chinese exporter who supplies molds and parts to a snow-bike factory in Nebraska as well as fishing and hunting goods to a U.S. retailer in Texas, also thinks the remaining 30% tariff is too high to take comfort in.",
      "With the possibility Washington and Beijing will negotiate over the 20% tariff Trump imposed due to what he described as China\u2019s failure to stem the flow of fentanyl, Zou said he would wait until the end of May to decide when to resume shipments to the U.S.",
      "Silva, of WS Game Company, said he planned to begin placing his holiday season orders this week but won't be as bold as he might have been if the ultra-high tariff had been suspended for more than 90 day.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to change the pricing model for some medications is facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he\u2019s even signed an executive order he says will lower the costs of drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to do the right thing,\u201d he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "House Republicans have unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump's \u201c big, beautiful bill \u201d late Sunday, at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks.",
      "Tallying hundreds of pages, the legislation is touching off the biggest political fight over health care since Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, during Trump's first term in 2017 \u2014 which ended in failure.",
      "While Republicans insist they are simply rooting out \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d to generate savings with new work and eligibility requirements, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "\u201cSavings like these allow us to use this bill to renew the Trump tax cuts and keep Republicans\u2019 promise to hardworking middle-class families,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the GOP chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which handles health care spending.",
      "But Democrats said the cuts are \u201cshameful\u201d and essentially amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare.",
      "\u201cIn no uncertain terms, millions of Americans will lose their health care coverage,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the panel. He said \"hospitals will close, seniors will not be able to access the care they need, and premiums will rise for millions of people if this bill passes.\"",
      "As Republicans race toward House Speaker Mike Johnson's Memorial Day deadline to pass Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, they are preparing to flood the zone with round-the-clock public hearings this week on various sections before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.",
      "The politics ahead are uncertain. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that residents back home depend on. Trump himself has shied away from a repeat of his first term, vowing there will be no cuts to Medicaid.",
      "All told, 11 committees in the House have been compiling their sections of the package as Republicans seek at least $1.5 trillion in savings to help cover the cost of preserving the 2017 tax breaks, which were approved during Trump\u2019s first term and are expiring at the end of the year.",
      "But the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee has been among the most watched. The committee was instructed to come up with $880 billion in savings and reached that goal, primarily with the health care cuts, but also by rolling back Biden-era green energy programs. The preliminary CBO analysis said the committee's proposals would reduce the deficit by $912 billion over the decade \u2014 with at least $715 billion coming from the health provisions.",
      "Central to the savings are changes to Medicaid, which provides almost free health care to more than 70 million Americans, and the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded in the 15 years since it was first approved to cover millions more.",
      "To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. People would also have to verify their eligibility to be in the program twice a year, rather than just once.",
      "This is likely to lead to more churn in the program and present hurdles for people to stay covered, especially if they have to drive far to a local benefits office to verify their income in person. But Republicans say it\u2019ll ensure that the program is administered to those who qualify for it.",
      "Many states have expanded their Medicaid rosters thanks to federal incentives, but the legislation would cut a 5% boost that was put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal funding to the states for immigrants who have not shown proof of citizenship would be prohibited.",
      "There would be a freeze on the so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that creates abuse in the system.",
      "The energy portions of the legislation run far fewer pages, but include rollbacks of climate-change strategies President Joe Biden signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "It proposes rescinding funds for a range of energy loans and investment programs while providing expedited permitting for natural gas development and oil pipelines.",

    "story": [
      "A new study shows that people Zepbound lost about 50% more weight than those using Wegovy",
      "People taking Eli Lilly's obesity drug, Zepbound, lost nearly 50% more weight than those using rival Novo Nordisk's Wegovy in the first head-to-head study of the blockbuster medications.",
      "Clinical trial participants who took tirzepatide, the drug sold as Zepbound, lost an average of 50 pounds (22.8 kilograms) over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds (15 kilograms). That's according to the study funded by Lilly, which was published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Both drugs are part of a new class of medications that work by mimicking hormones in the gut and brain that regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. But tirzepatide targets two such hormones, known as GLP-1 and GIP, while semaglutide targets GLP-1 alone, said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.",
      "\u201cTwo drugs together can produce better weight loss,\u201d said Aronne, who led the study and presented the findings Sunday at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain.",
      "While tirzepatide won out in what Aronne said many view as \u201ca drag race of efficacy,\u201d both are important tools for treating obesity, which affects about 40% of American adults.",
      "\u201cThe point of these medications is to improve health,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of people won't need the most effective medication.\u201d",
      "The trial included 751 people from across the U.S. who were overweight or had obesity and at least one other weight-related health problem, but not diabetes. Participants received weekly injections of the highest tolerated doses of Zepbound, either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or Wegovy, 1.7 milligrams or 2.4 milligrams.",
      "By the end of the trial, those who took Zepbound lost about 20% of their body weight on average, compared with a nearly 14% loss for those who took Wegovy. The tirzepatide group trimmed about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters) from their waist circumference, compared to about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) with semaglutide. In addition, nearly 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy, the study found.",
      "Weight loss was about 6% lower in men than in women in both groups, the authors noted. As participants in both groups lost more weight, they saw improvements in health markers such as blood pressure, blood fat and blood sugar levels.",
      "More than three-quarters of patients taking both drugs reported at least one side effect, mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting. About 6% of participants taking Zepbound left the trial because of adverse events, compared with 8% of those taking semaglutide.",
      "The GLP-1 drugs have become increasingly popular, with at least 1 in 8 U.S. adults reporting their use, according to a 2024 survey by KFF, a independent health policy research organization. Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in global sales last year. Wegovy brought in nearly $8.8 billion (58.2 billlion Danish kroner).",
      "Access and affordability have limited wider use of the drugs. Tirzepatide and semaglutide were removed recently from a list of drug shortages by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both manufacturers recently released programs that cut costs to about $500 per month or less, depending on the dose.",
      "Other factors can affect access. This week, CVS Health said Wegovy will become the preferred option on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.",
      "It's important to have a range of drugs to treat a disease as widespread as obesity in the U.S., said Dr. Angela Fitch, chief medical officer of knownwell, an obesity care company. Wegovy has been found to cut the risk of serious heart problems by 20%, she noted. A drug may work well for one patient, but not for others.",
      "\u201cWe're going to need to use them all just because we have so many patients who need treatment,\u201d she added.",

      "Federal officials say at least 10 people in the U.S. have been sickened in a listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat food products, and a producer is voluntarily recalling several items",
      "SAN FERNANDO, Calif. -- At least 10 people in the U.S. have been sickened in a listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat food products, and a producer is voluntarily recalling several products, federal officials said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Saturday that federal, state and local officials are investigating the outbreak linked to foods produced by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC of San Fernando, California. The FDA says the 10 people who fell ill were in California and Nevada, and required hospitalization.",
      "The agency said the products were sold in Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington at locations including retailers and food service points of sale, including hospitals, hotels, convenience stores, airports and by airlines.",
      "Listeria symptoms usually start within two weeks of eating contaminated food. Mild cases can include fever, muscle aches, nausea, tiredness, vomiting and diarrhea, while more severe symptoms may include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Federal officials said they started investigating the recent outbreak last year but didn't have enough evidence to identify a source of the infections. They said the investigation was reopened in April when FDA investigators found listeria in samples collected from Fresh & Ready Foods that matched the strain from the outbreak.",
      "Fresh & Ready Foods said in a news release that it took immediate corrective actions including removing equipment to address the issue.",
      "The FDA found that six of the 10 people who got sick had been hospitalized before becoming ill with listeria. The FDA found that items made by Fresh & Ready Foods had been served in at least three of the health care facilities where the patients had been previously treated.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the test samples from sick patients were collected from December 2023 to September 2024.",
      "Fresh & Ready voluntarily recalled several products, which can be identified by \u201cuse by\u201d dates ranging from April 22 to May 19 of this year under the brand names Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go and Fresh Take Crave Away.",

      "\u201cThunderbolts\u201d took first place, with $33.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. Internationally, it added $34 million, bringing its global total to $272.2 million.

      "\u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, crossed the $200 million mark in North American ticket sales this weekend, which is especially notable for an original R-rated movie.

      "A global trade war is offering Puerto Rico hope as the island attempts to strengthen its fragile economy",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A global trade war is offering Puerto Rico hope as the U.S. territory attempts to strengthen its fragile economy.",
      "Government officials are jumping on planes to try and convince international companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to the island, where they would be exempt from tariffs.",
      "Any relocation would be a boost to Puerto Rico\u2019s shaky economy as the government emerges from a historic bankruptcy and continues to struggle with chronic power outages. The island also is bracing for potentially big cuts in federal funding under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, with federal funds currently representing more than half of Puerto Rico\u2019s budget.",
      "\u201cThe tariff issue is a controversial one, but for Puerto Rico, it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d said Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "Manufacturing remains the island\u2019s biggest industry, representing nearly half of its gross domestic product. But the government wants to recapture Puerto Rico\u2019s heyday, when dozens of big-name companies, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, were based here and kept the economy humming.",
      "So far, officials have identified between 75 to 100 companies that might consider relocating operations to Puerto Rico given the ongoing trade war, said Ella Woger Nieves, CEO of Invest Puerto Rico, a public-private partnership that promotes the island as a business and investment destination.",
      "The companies identified work in sectors including aerospace, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.",
      "Officials also have welcomed site selectors to Puerto Rico and organized tours to show them the island\u2019s available infrastructure and stress how tariffs wouldn\u2019t apply here.",
      "\u201cThis is the moment to plant those seeds,\u201d Woger Nieves said.",
      "She said officials with Invest Puerto Rico and various government agencies are expected to make almost 20 more trips this year in a bid to attract more manufacturing to the island. The government praised an executive order that Trump signed Monday that aims to reduce the time it takes to approve construction of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the U.S.",
      "In the mid-1900s, needlework was one of Puerto Rico\u2019s largest industries, employing about 7,000 workers who labored on handkerchiefs, underwear, bedspreads and other items, according to a 1934 fair competition code signed by President Theodore Roosevelt.",
      "Manufacturing later shifted to chemicals, clothes and electronics. By the late 1970s, a growing number of pharmaceutical companies began moving their operations to Puerto Rico, lured by a federal tax incentive created in 1976 to help boost the island\u2019s economic growth. However, in 1996, the U.S. government began phasing out the incentive, which exempted the subsidiaries of U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico from federal taxes on local profits.",
      "From 1995 to 2005, overall manufacturing employment fell by nearly 30%, but employment in the sectors of pharmaceuticals, medicines and chemicals increased by at least 10%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Puerto Rico continues to lead U.S. exports of pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, representing nearly 20% of total U.S. exports in 2020, according to the bureau.",
      "In 2024, the island exported nearly $25 billion worth of goods, including $11 billion worth of vaccines and certain cultures; $7 billion worth of packaged medicaments; $1 billion worth of hormones; $984 million worth of orthopedic items; and $625 million worth of medical instruments, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.",
      "Sergio Marxuach, policy director and general counsel for the Center for a New Economy, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank, said the push to attract more companies makes sense, especially recruiting those in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors.",
      "\u201cIf I were advising the government, begin there because you already have a footprint,\u201d he said.",
      "Marxuach noted that outside of those areas, Puerto Rico could have an advantage when it comes to national defense and security contracts, including the manufacturing of drones or underwater surveillance systems.",
      "\u201cThey need a place to manufacture in scale,\u201d he said, adding that doing so in a U.S. jurisdiction is key.",
      "Puerto Rico\u2019s government also is meeting with university officials to potentially change curriculums if needed to ensure students are graduating with the skills required by companies.",
      "Puerto Rico touts its U.S. jurisdiction, tax incentives and skilled workforce as reasons international companies should relocate to the island.",
      "But it cannot escape its well-known energy problems.",
      "Chronic power outages continue to plague Puerto Rico, with two island-wide blackouts occurring on Dec. 31 and April 16.",
      "Crews are still repairing the power grid after it was razed by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already fragile following a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico needs more reliable energy for the economic growth to improve,\u201d said Robert F. Mujica, executive director of a federal control board that oversees the island\u2019s finances.",
      "Woger Nieves, the CEO of Invest Puerto Rico, said that when officials meet with company leaders, they explain the state of the island\u2019s energy infrastructure and offer alternatives including cogeneration and renewables.",
      "\u201cPower doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be an impediment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marxuach, with the Center for a New Economy, said Puerto Rico\u2019s energy system is costly and inefficient, and noted that alternatives can be expensive.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico has to address some issues that actually create additional costs for investors to come here,\u201d he said.",
      "One those costs is that any goods sent to the U.S. from Puerto Rico must by law be sent aboard a U.S.-flagged vessel with a U.S. crew.",
      "Other challenges remain.",
      "Currently, the short-term reaction of many CEOs and companies \u201cis basically to wait and see\u201d how the tariff war plays out, Marxuach said.",
      "Trump has said that he wants to keep some tariffs in place, but he also has mentioned efforts to reach deals with trading partners. His team said Trump is using \u201cstrategic uncertainty\u201d to his advantage.",
      "Another dilemma is that relocating operations takes years, not months, and other countries also are vying for the attention of international companies.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re competing with Vietnam, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, that have very advanced manufacturing facilities already,\u201d Marxuach said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam dunk.\u201d",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of the Newark Liberty International Airport for the \u201cnext several weeks,\u201d as New Jersey's largest airport struggles with radar outages and numerous flight delays and cancellations due to a shortage of air traffic controllers.",
      "Speaking on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Duffy said he will convene a meeting with all the airlines flying out of Newark this week to determine the reduction, adding that it will fluctuate, with a larger reduction coming in the afternoons when international flight arrivals make the airport busier.",
      "\u201cWe want to have a number of flights that if you book your flight, you know it\u2019s going to fly, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the priority. So you don\u2019t get to the airport, wait four hours, and then get delayed.\u201d",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday, similar to an April 28 incident.",
      "There has been an average of 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid-April at Newark, according to the FAA, with the number of delays increasing throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. They tend to last 85 to 137 minutes on average.",
      "The Trump administration proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the U.S. air traffic control system Thursday that includes six new air traffic control centers and technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation\u2019s air traffic facilities over the next three or four years.",
      "Duffy said Sunday that he also plans to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61, as he tries to navigate a shortage of about 3,000 people in that specialized position.",
      "He plans to give those air traffic controllers a 20% upfront bonus to stay on the job. However, he says many air traffic controllers choose to retire after 25 years of service, which means many retire around the age of 50.",
      "\u201cThese are not overnight fixes,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cBut as we go up \u2014 one, two years, older guys on the job, younger guys coming in, men and women \u2014 we can make up that 3,000-person difference.\u201d",
      "Adding more air traffic controllers is in contrast to a top priority of the Trump administration \u2014 slashing jobs in nearly all other federal agencies. However, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Duffy deserves credit for putting \u201ccaution tape\u201d around FAA safety functions and separating those personnel from DOGE cost-cutting.",
      "Kirby said United has already reduced its schedule at Newark, and will meet with Duffy later this week. He expects a deeper cut in capacity to last until June 15 when construction to one of Newark's runways is expected to be complete, though he thinks some reductions will last throughout the summer.",
      "\u201cWe have fewer flights, but we keep everything safe, and we get the airplane safely on the ground,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cSafety is number one, and so I\u2019m not worried about safety. I am worried about customer delays and impacts.\u201d",

      "Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $108.1 billion over the quarter, the company reported in a filing on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul stock exchange. The company saw $107.2 billion in revenues and profits of $27.2 billion the same quarter last year.",

      "Perhaps as much as ever, all eyes in the movie world will be on the 78th Cannes Film Festival when it gets underway Tuesday in the South of France",
      "Nowhere is the border-crossing nature of cinema more evident than the Cannes Film Festival, which kicks off Tuesday in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s vow to enact tariffs on international films.",
      "Cannes, where filmmakers, sales agents and journalists gather from around the world, is the Olympics of the big screen, with its own golden prize, the Palme d\u2019Or, to give out at the end. Filmmakers come from nearly every corner of the globe to showcase their films while dealmakers work through the night to sell finished films or packaged productions to various territories.",
      "\u201cYou release a film into that Colosseum-like situation,\u201d says Brazilian director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, who\u2019s returning to Cannes with \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a thriller set during Brazil\u2019s dictatorship. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to really prepare for the whole experience because it\u2019s quite intense \u2014 not very far from the feeling of approaching a roller coaster as you go up the steps at the Palais.\u201d",
      "Perhaps as much as ever, all eyes in the movie world will be on the 78th Cannes Film Festival when it gets underway this week. That\u2019s not just because of the long list of anticipated films set to premiere at the Cote d\u2019Azur festival (including films from Spike Lee, Wes Anderson, Lynne Ramsay, Richard Linklater and Ari Aster) and the extensive coterie of stars set to walk the fabled red carpet (Jennifer Lawrence, Denzel Washington, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart among them).",
      "As the movies, and the Oscar race, have grown more international, the global launchpad of Cannes has become only more central to the larger film ecosystem \u2014 even with the ongoing absence of Netflix. Recent editions of Cannes have produced a string of Academy Awards contenders, including this year\u2019s best-picture winner, \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "At the same time, geopolitics course through Cannes unlike any other festival. The Cannes red carpet can be as much a platform for political protest as it is for glamour. This year\u2019s festival will include a dissident Iranian filmmaker (Jafar Panahi), a Ukrainian filmmaker (Sergei Loznitsa) and the first Nigerian production in the official selection (Akinola Davies Jr.'s \u201cMy Father's Shadow\u201d).",
      "In the run-up to the festival, three filmmakers from different corners of the world spoke about their roads to the Cannes competition lineup. For many directors, reaching the Cannes competition \u2014 this year, that's 22 movies vying for the Palme d'Or \u2014 is career milestone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meaningful for me. It\u2019s meaningful for the country,\u201d says Oliver Hermanus, speaking from outside Cape Town. Hermanus, the South African filmmaker of \u201cMoffie\u201d and \u201cLiving,\u201d is in competition for the first time with \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d a period love story starring Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cI was born here and made movies here for most of my career, so I still see myself as a South African filmmaker who\u2019s interested in the South African perspective on things and South African representation,\u201d adds Hermanus. \u201cThe competition is something I\u2019ve always wanted to be part of.\u201d",
      "Chie Hayakawa, the Japanese filmmaker of 2022's \u201cPlan 75,\u201d is also in competition for the first time. She first came to Cannes with a student film that she never expected to make it into the festival\u2019s shorts program. This week, she\u2019ll debut \u201cRenoir,\u201d a semiautobiographical tale about an 11-year-old girl with a father who has terminal cancer.",
      "\u201cIt gives me a huge encouragement and keeps me motivated to making films,\u201d Hayakawa said from Tokyo. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to compete with other films. But it meaningful. I know how prestigious and meaningful it is to be in competition.\u201d",
      "\u201cFilm is global and easily crosses the borders of any country or culture,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat\u2019s what special about Cannes.\u201d",
      "Cannes' global approach is part of what makes this year more complicated than usual. Trump sent shock waves through Hollywood and the international film community when he announced on May 4 that all movies \u201cproduced in Foreign Lands\u201d will face 100% tariffs.",
      "The White House has said no final decisions have been made. Options being explored include federal incentives for U.S.-based productions, rather than tariffs. But the announcement was a reminder of how international tensions can destabilize even the oldest cultural institutions.",
      "Filho first attended Cannes as a critic. Once he began making movies, the allure of the festival remained. To him, participating in Cannes means joining a timeline of cinema history. \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d marks his third time in competition.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- At the biggest jewelry center in the United States, Alberto Hernandez fired up his machine on a recent day and waited until it glowed bright orange inside before shoveling in an assortment of rings, earrings and necklaces weighing about as much as a bar of soap: just under 100 grams, or 3.2 troy ounces.",
      "Minutes later, the bubbling liquid metal was cooling in a rectangular cast the size of a woman's shoe. An X-ray machine determined it was 56.5% gold, making it worth $177,000 based on the price of gold that day.",
      "As gold prices soar to record highs during global economic jitters, hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of gold are circulating through the doors of St. Vincent Jewelry Center in downtown Los Angeles on any given day.",

      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of rappers and stuff melting their big pieces,\u201d said Alberto\u2019s nephew, Sabashden Hernandez, who works at A&M Precious Metals. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of new customers who are just getting all of their grandfather\u2019s stuff, melting it down pretty much.\u201d",
      "Gold\u2019s current rally comes as President Donald Trump issues ever-changing announcements on tariffs, roiling financial markets and threatening to reignite inflation.",
      "In response, people across the country are flocking to sell or melt down their old jewelry for quick cash, including middlemen like pawn shop owners. Others, thinking their money might be safer in gold than in the volatile stock market, are snapping it up just as fast.",
      "Los Angeles jeweler Olivia Kazanjian said people are even bringing in family heirlooms.",

      "She recently paid a client for a 14-karat gold woven bracelet with intricate blue enamel work that could be turned into a brooch. The customer walked away with $3,200 for the amount of gold contained in the piece measured in troy ounces, the standard for precious metals equivalent to 31 grams.",
      "But Kazanjian doesn't plan to melt the piece. The real artistic and historical value was a lot more, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just stunning \u2026 and you won\u2019t see that kind of craftsmanship again,\u201d Kazanjian said, adding she has persuaded some customers to change their minds about melting items. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to inherit it, it\u2019s a piece of your family.\"",
      "Businesses on the sales side of the action, offering gold bars and other material, also are working hard to keep up with the frenzy.",

      "Business hasn't been good for everyone, though.",
      "For some jewelers who source their products from places abroad like Italy, Turkey and China, the combination of high gold prices and added tariffs have cut into profit margins and hurt demand.",
      "\u201cOur profit margins are so razor thin here,\u201d said Puzant Berberian, whose family founded V&P Jewelry inside St. Vincent in 1983. Berberian said he recently paid an extra $16,000 on a package from overseas.",
      "Customers also are feeling \u201csticker shock\u201d when they can't afford the things they used to. A chunky, 14-karat gold bracelet weighing about 10 grams (0.32 troy ounces) might have sold for around $600 last year, but now it\u2019s closer to $900, Berberian said.",
      "Some believe those trends could continue, both for consumers and businesses.",
      "Customers hoping to buy bullion \u201cthink gold will go up\u201d even more, according to Sam Nguyen, whose business, Newport Gold Post Inc., has bought and sold gold and other precious metals at St. Vincent for five years. While gold has cooled from its record high of $3,500 per troy ounce, Nguyen thinks it could reach $4,000 to $5,000 by year\u2019s end.",
      "Jeff Clark agrees. The founder of The Gold Advisor, which provides investment advice, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if gold prices continue rising since the metal is considered a haven for people to park their money when there is anxiety about a possible recession.",
      "\u201cHistory shows it has gone much higher in the past,\u201d Clark said, referring to a frenzy in the 1970s when the average price of gold increased 17-fold amid double-digit inflation rates. \u201cIf the fear and uncertainty continues in the general populace, the prices are going to keep going up.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- What, exactly, the Republican Party stands for in terms of economic policy in the second Trump administration is a question reaching an inflection point.",
      "Is it the party that promotes free-market prosperity or a 21st-century populism?",
      "Does it stick with the \u201cNo new taxes\u201d pledge that has been GOP political orthodoxy for decades or do Republicans tax the rich, as President Donald Trump suggests?",
      "Roll back the Obama-era's health care expansion and the President Joe Biden's green energy investments or protect the federal flow of investment dollars generating jobs in the states?",
      "Slash deficit spending or spike the nation\u2019s now $36 trillion debt load?",
      "Free trade or Trump\u2019s tariffs?",
      "As House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Republicans race to draft Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, the final product will set the party on a defining path.",
      "It\u2019s still a work in progress.",
      "\u201cThis idea of the American dream where we are the best country in the world \u2014 which I believe we are \u2013 will be gone and it\u2019ll be our fault, so we have to do something right now to address it,\u201d said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga.",
      "\u201cAnd everybody wants to say, \u2018Oh, yeah, we should do something,\u2019 but nobody\u2019s willing to say what that hard choice is.\u201d",
      "The GOP is shape-shifting its economic policy priorities in real time, transforming from a party that once put a premium on lower taxes and smaller government into something more reflective of the interests of the working-class coalition that depends on the federal safety net and put Trump in the White House.",
      "On the one side, there\u2019s the old-school Republican stalwarts who have guided policy thinking for years. Among them are former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who says tax increases would be \u201cstupid, destructive\u201d and the influential Club for Growth, which pours millions into political campaigns.",
      "But a rising neo-populist power center with proximity to Trump carries clout, with Steve Banon and others who reject the traditional trickle-down economic policies and propose a new direction that more benefits Americans.",
      "Divisions run strong within the Republican Party, which holds the majority on Capitol Hill, and is bulldozing past Democratic objections to push its package forward on its own. GOP lawmakers are under mounting pressure to set aside their differences by Johnson's Memorial Day deadline, especially as Trump\u2019s tariffs stoke unease, and they are eager to signal that the economy is under control on their watch.",
      "\u201cThis is a once in a generation bill,\u201d said Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House conservatives.",
      "He said not only would the emerging package extend the tax breaks and cut spending, \"it also gives us a mentality just to settle the markets, to give some predictability, to give everybody in our country the ability to go, hey, our economy is going to be strong.\u201d",
      "This weekend, Republican leaders are working to finish the 11 separate sections that will make up that big package before potential public hearings in the coming week.",
      "But the final three \u2014 on tax policy, Medicaid and green energy programs, and food stamp assistance \u2014 have proved to be the most difficult, posing the biggest political risks.",
      "Moderate conservative Republicans in the House have signed on to letters opposing steep cuts to Medicaid, which provides health care to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "The Medicaid program has expanded in the 15 years since the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, became law, as more states signed up for federal cost-sharing allotments, and people benefited from enhanced federal credits to pay their insurance premiums. Republicans who pledged to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the health law during Trump's first term are now insisting they only want to target what they say is waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, as many fight to save its more popular parts.",
      "Many of those same moderate GOP lawmakers also oppose rolling back the green energy tax breaks that Democrats approved under Biden as companies invest in wind, solar and other renewable energy development.",
      "At the same time, the more conservative Republicans are roaring back, insisting on deep cuts.",
      "Some 30 Republicans said the party must hold to the original GOP budget framework of up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, which they argue are needed to prevent the tax cuts from piling on annual deficits that are fueling the nation's debt load. The cost of the tax cuts, first approved by Republicans in 2017, during Trump's first term, is expected to grow if Republicans add other priorities, including no taxes on tipped wages or Social Security income. Estimates put the final costs beyond $7 trillion.",

      "Trump himself has waded into the debate in uneven ways. The president told Johnson this past week that he wanted to see a higher tax rate on incomes of $2.5 million for single filers, or $5 million for couples, only to sort of back off the idea Friday.",
      "\u201cRepublicans should probably not do it, but I\u2019m OK if they do!!!\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "With Republicans going it alone, over the objections of Democrats in the House and Senate critical of the tax package as a giveaway to the rich that will hurt Americans who depend on federal services, leaders will need almost every Republican on board.",
      "One Republican, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, implored his colleagues not to worry about the politics of the next midterm election and to stick to party principles.",

    "story": [
      "A female business owner in Uganda wanted to create a coffee sisterhood",
      "SIRONKO, Uganda -- Meridah Nandudu envisioned a coffee sisterhood in Uganda, and the strategy for expanding it was simple: Pay a higher price per kilogram when a female grower took the beans to a collection point.",
      "It worked. More and more men who typically made the deliveries allowed their wives to go instead.",
      "Nandudu\u2019s business group now includes more than 600 women, up from dozens in 2022. That\u2019s about 75% of her Bayaaya Specialty Coffee\u2019s pool of registered farmers in this mountainous area of eastern Uganda that produces prized arabica beans and sells to exporters.",
      "\u201cWomen have been so discouraged by coffee in a way that, when you look at (the) coffee value chain, women do the donkey work,\u201d Nandudu said. But when the coffee is ready for selling, men step in to claim the proceeds.",
      "Her goal is to reverse that trend in a community where coffee production is not possible without women's labor.",
      "Uganda is one of Africa\u2019s top two coffee producers, and the crop is its leading export. The east African country exported more than 6 million bags of coffee between September 2023 and August 2024, accounting for $1.3 billion in earnings, according to the Uganda Coffee Development Authority.",
      "The earnings have been rising as production dwindles in Brazil, the world\u2019s top coffee producer, which faces unfavorable drought conditions.",
      "In Sironko district, where Nandudu grew up in a remote village near the Kenya border, coffee is the community's lifeblood. As a girl, when she was not at school, she helped her mother and other women look after acres of coffee plants. They usually planted, weeded and toiled with the post-harvest routine that includes pulping, fermenting, washing and drying the coffee.",
      "The harvest season was known to coincide with a surge in cases of domestic violence, she said. Couples fought over how much of the earnings that men brought home from sales \u2014 and how much they didn't.",
      "\u201cWhen (men) go and sell, they are not accountable. Our mothers cannot ask, \u2018We don\u2019t have food at home. You sold coffee. Can you pay school fees for this child?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Years later, Nandudu earned her degree in the social sciences from Uganda\u2019s top public university in 2015, with her father funding her education from coffee earnings. She had the idea to launch a company that would prioritize the needs of coffee-producing women in the country's conservative society.",
      "She thought of her project as a kind of sisterhood and chose \u201cbayaaya\" \u2014 a translation in the Lumasaba language \u2014 for her company's name.",
      "It launched in 2018, operating like others that buy coffee directly from farmers and process it for export.",
      "But Bayaaya is unique in Mbale, the largest city in eastern Uganda, for focusing on women and for initiatives such as a cooperative saving society that members can contribute to and borrow from.",
      "For small-holder Ugandan farmers in remote areas, a small movement in the price of a kilogram of coffee is a major event. The decision to sell to one or another middleman often hinges on small price differences.",
      "A decade ago, the price of coffee bought by a middleman from a Ugandan farmer was roughly 8,000 Uganda shillings, or just over $2 at today\u2019s exchange rate. Now the price is roughly $5.",
      "Nandudu adds an extra 200 shillings to the price of every kilogram she buys from a woman. It\u2019s enough of an incentive that more women are joining. Another benefit is a small bonus payment during the off-season from February to August.",
      "That motivates many local men \u201cto trust their women to sell coffee,\u201d Nandudu said. \u201cWhen a woman sells coffee, she has a hand in it.\u201d",
      "Nandudu\u2019s group has many collection points across eastern Uganda, and women trek to them at least twice a week. Men are not turned away.",
      "Selling as a Bayaaya member has fostered teamwork as her family collectively decides how to spend coffee earnings, said Linet Gimono, who joined the group in 2022.",
      "And with assured earnings, she\u2019s able to afford the \"small things\u201d she often needs as a woman. \u201cI can buy soap (and) I can buy sugar without pulling ropes with my husband over it,\u201d she said.",
      "Another member, Juliet Kwaga, said her mother never would have thought of collecting coffee earnings because her father was very much in charge.",
      "Now, Kwaga's husband, with a bit of encouragement, is comfortable sending her. \u201cAt the end of the day I go home with something to feed my family, to support my children,\" she said.",
      "In Sironko district, home to more than 200,000 people, coffee trees dot the hilly terrain. Much of the farming is on plots of one or two acres, although some families have larger tracts.",
      "Many farmers don\u2019t usually drink coffee, and some have never tasted it. Some women smiled in embarrassment when asked what it tasted like.",
      "But things are slowly changing. Routine coffee drinkers are emerging among younger women in the coffee business in urban areas, including at a roasting place in Mbale where most employees are women.",
      "Phoebe Nabutale, who helps oversee quality assurance for Darling Coffee, was raised in a family of coffee growers. She bent over the roaster, smelling the beans until she got the aroma she wanted.",
      "Many of her girlfriends, she said, regularly ask how they can break into the coffee business, as roasters or otherwise.",
      "For Nandudu, who aims to start exporting beans, that's progress.",
      "Now there are more women in \u201ccoffee as a business,\u201d she said.",

      "The Norwegian company Equinor says it will be forced to terminate an offshore wind project for New York within days unless the Trump administration lets construction resume",
      "The Norwegian energy company Equinor said Friday it will be forced to terminate an offshore wind project for New York within days unless President Donald Trump 's administration relents on its order that stopped construction.",
      "Work on Empire Wind has been paused since April 16, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt construction. Burgum said it needs further review because it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval. Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year, and the project is roughly a third complete.",
      "Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and has signed a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. His first day in office, Trump signed an executive order temporarily halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and pausing the issuance of approvals, permits and loans for all wind projects.",
      "Empire Wind is fully permitted and the developer has already invested more than $2.5 billion so far in the project, said Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, in an interview Friday.",
      "She said this is an \u201curgent, unsustainable situation\u201d because each day of uncertainty is extremely expensive: Equinor spends up to $50 million per week on the project and has 11 vessels on standby. The developer has done a significant amount of onshore work already, where the cable from the wind farm will connect to the local grid.",
      "\u201cIf no material progress is made toward a resolution within days, Equinor will be forced to terminate the project,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about honoring contracts and financial investments made in the U.S. It could set a dangerous precedent by stopping a project in mid-execution.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Equinor has over $60 billion in investments across the U.S., including substantial oil, gas and renewable projects. RWE, a German energy company, has stopped its offshore wind work in the United States, citing the political environment. French energy giant TotalEnergies paused the development of its offshore wind project in New York after Trump won reelection.",
      "Equinor is considering legal options, but rather than getting tied up in the courts, Morris said the best way forward is a quicker political resolution. The summer construction window for major offshore work began this month, and missing it would set the project back a year, she said.",
      "Morris and Equinor CEO Anders Opedal met with Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Wednesday. She said it was helpful, but they've asked to meet with Burgum and haven't gotten a meeting.",
      "Equinor is building Empire Wind to start providing power in 2026 for more than 500,000 New York homes. Equinor finalized the federal lease for Empire Wind in March 2017, early in Trump\u2019s first term. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the construction and operations plan in February 2024 and construction began that year.",
      "New York is leading a coalition of state attorneys general challenging the wind energy executive order in court. They say in the lawsuit filed Monday that Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he\u2019s jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states\u2019 economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.",
      "The White House says Democratic attorneys general are trying to stop the president\u2019s popular energy agenda instead of working with him to restore America\u2019s energy dominance.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re still continuing to see pressure on travel into the U.S., but we\u2019ve also seen some rebalancing,\u201d Gorin said. \u201cEuropeans are traveling less to the U.S., but more to Latin America.\u201d",

      "Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade has taken aim at a number of foreign goods, from European wines and car parts from Mexico to films made abroad. Lately, the president's wandering ire has found another rhetorical poster child: toy dolls.",
      "Trump asserted that children will be fine having two dolls \u2014 perhaps three or five \u2014 instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch and photos of a young Barron Trump\u2019s child-sized Mercedes convertible.",
      "\u201cCOMPLETELY out of touch,\" The Loyal Subjects CEO Jonathan Cathey, whose collectible toy company in Los Angeles produces Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite dolls, wrote on Linkedin. \"If that ain\u2019t a \u2018Let them eat cake\u2019 moment shot through the echoes of history? Love how toys and dolls have become THE martyr metaphor for this nonsensical trade war incoherence.\u201d",
      "The president's comments also touched a nerve with parents, both ones who took offense at the casual way he hypothesized that perhaps \u201ctwo dolls will cost a couple bucks more\u201d and those who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need.",
      "Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff between the Trump administration and the government in Beijing. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. come from China.",
      "The Toy Association, a trade group, has lobbied for an immediate reprieve from the 145% tariff rate the president put on Chinese-made products. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect.",
      "Here's a snapshot of the doll debate and how tariffs are impacting toys:",
      "From Barbie, Bratz and Cabbage Patch Kids to Adora baby dolls, American Girl and Our Generation, dolls are a big business in the U.S. as well as beloved playthings.",
      "The doll category, which includes accessories like clothes, generated U.S. sales of $2.7 billion last year compared to $2.9 billion in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Circana.",
      "Consumers splurged on toys during the height of the COVID pandemic to keep children and themselves occupied, but sales flattened as inflation seized the economy.",
      "Younger girls becoming more interested in buying makeup and skincare also has cooled the demand for dolls, Marshal Cohen, Circana's chief retail advisor, said.",
      "The nation's largest toy maker, Mattel, said this week it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the U.S. to offset higher costs related to tariffs.",
      "The company, whose brands include Barbie and American Girl, said the increases were necessary even though it\u2019s speeding up the expansion of its manufacturing base outside of China.",
      "Smaller toy companies are expected to have a harder time than Mattel and Hasbro, which makes the eating, drinking and diaper-wetting Baby Alive. Cathey said he paused The Loyal Subjects' shipments from China in April because he couldn't pay the stratospheric tariff they would have incurred.",
      "\u201cNobody insulates themselves with that much cash,\u201d he said.",
      "With about four months' worth of inventory on hand, Cathey said his ability to secure holiday stock depends on a break in the U.S.-China trade standoff happening in the next two weeks since it would take time for cargo operations to resume.",
      "Cepia, a Missouri company that was behind the 2009 holiday season hit Zhu Zhu Pets, launched a line of 11-inch fashion dolls called Decora Girlz last year. CEO James Russell Hornsby said he was working to relocate some production but the move won't happen in time to replace the orders he planned to get from China.",
      "Hornsby described himself as a Trump supporter and said he understands the administration's desire to reduce trade imbalances.",
      "\u201cLet's just get the deals done and stop all this because (Trump's) disrupting Christmas,\u201d he said.",
      "Although American Girl launched in 1986 with a line based on fictional historical characters, the dolls never were domestic products. They were made in Germany before production eventually moved to China.",
      "Toy experts say that in addition to lower costs, Chinese factories have developed techniques and expertise that are not easily replicated.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any capacity in the U.S. to make rooted doll hair. And then you\u2019ve got things like the faces. Some of them are hand-painted, others are done with a Tampo (printing) machine,\u201d James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry publication The Toy Book, said of doll-making.",
      "Hornsby said rooting the synthetic hair onto the heads of Decora Girlz dolls is carried out by skilled workers at factories in Guangzhou and Dongguan, China.",
      "\u201cIt's not just sticking into a machine and it automatically does it,\" he said. \u201dYou have to know what you\u2019re doing in order to make that doll look like it\u2019s got a full set of hair when literally maybe only 60% of the head is filled with hair.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said last week that he assumes consumers would prefer to pay more for American-made products. Dolls made in China might have lead paint in them, he said.",
      "Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the picture is more complicated.",
      "Products for children ages 12 and under require third-party testing and certification from labs approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing lead levels in toys, Murray said.",
      "The rules apply to all products sold in the U.S. Toys by major brands such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, which have long outsourced manufacturing to China, are usually in compliance, she said.",
      "But the rise of online shopping, including e-commerce platforms that ship directly to U.S. consumers from overseas, has posed a challenge, according to Murray. When valued at less than $800, such parcels entered the U.S. duty-free and were not subject to the same scrutiny as bulk imports, she said.",
      "The White House eliminated the customs exemption starting May 2 for low-value parcels that originated in mainland China and Hong Kong. U.S Customs and Border Protection expects additional oversight will make it easier to flag problems.",
      "Toy companies and industry experts argue the high tariffs on Chinese imports will tempt price-sensitive shoppers to search for cheap counterfeit toys that carry higher safety risks.",
      "Plenty of people agree American consumer culture has gotten out of hand, in large part due to prices kept low through the labor of foreign factory workers who earn much less than they would in the U.S.",
      "Katie Walley-Wiegert, 38, a senior marketer in Richmond, Virginia, and the parent of a 2-year-old son, agrees there\u2019s too much materialism but thinks parents should have choices when deciding what is best for their children. She found the wealthy Trump\u2019s comments off-putting.",
      "\u201cI think it is a small view of what purchase habits and realities are for people who buy toys for kids,\u201d Walley-Wiegert said.",
      "San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, who founded the Jilly Bing doll company after she couldn't find an Asian American doll for her daughter, Jillian, now 5, said the president's remarks upset her because some families struggle to buy even one doll.",
      "The trade war with China \u201cjust makes it even more impossible for those families,\u201d Mak said.",

    "story": [
      "The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks",
      "The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport briefly lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks, renewing concerns about the nation's aging air traffic control system that President Donald Trump wants to overhaul.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said the radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday. That\u2019s similar to what happened on April 28.",
      "That first radar outage led to hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed at the Newark airport in the past two weeks after the FAA slowed down traffic at the airport to ensure safety. Five controllers also went on trauma leave after that outage, worsening the existing shortage. It\u2019s not clear if any additional controllers will go on leave now.",
      "The number of cancellations and delays spiked after the FAA limited traffic at Newark and has remained high since then. The FAA plans to talk with all the airlines that fly out of Newark about cutting their schedules while the staffing and technology issues persist.",
      "The number of cancellations Friday morning was down around 40 departures and arrivals, but increased after the radar outage and a disruption related to ongoing runway construction. By the end of the day 68 departures and arrivals had been canceled in Newark, and more than 400 delays were reported.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Friday that the \u201cglitch this morning at Newark\u201d was caused by the same issues as last week.",
      "The latest Newark problems reinforce the need for the multi-billion-dollar plan Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Thursday to replace the nation\u2019s aging air traffic control system, Leavitt said. The plan is designed to prevent such problems from happening and give controllers modern technology. More than 4,600 new high-speed connections would be installed and 618 radars would be replaced across the country.",
      "Officials developed the plan to upgrade the system after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people in the skies over Washington, D.C. Several other crashes this year also put pressure on officials to act.",
      "But the shortcomings of the air traffic control system have been known for decades. The National Transportation Safety Board has not determined that a problem with the air traffic control system caused that crash near Reagan National Airport.",
      "These radar outages in such a crowded airspace are alarming because seconds matter, but Allied Pilots Association spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said \u201cit\u2019s not an impending disaster that some are suggesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe system is wired to run really well when everything\u2019s functioning. But the most important part is that it\u2019s prepared to function when things go wrong,\u201d Tajer said. \u201cEven when it sounds frightening, know that the air traffic controllers and the pilots have training and we go to that.\u201d",
      "When pilots lose contact with controllers their first action is to continue on their last-directed path, but if the outage continues, pilots will start broadcasting their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower.",
      "U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer blamed the problems that have plagued Newark on the lack of proper air traffic controller staffing and modern technology. He said at a news conference Friday that there are currently about 20 controllers working, and that number should be in the 60s. And many of the lines connecting controllers to the radar are outdated copper wires. He said the April 28 outage was caused by one of those copper wires getting fried.",
      "\u201cOur region is a key economic artery for our country. Yet this region... one of the busiest air spaces in the world, as I mentioned, is running off a tower that\u2019s full of copper wire dating back to the 1980s with outdated and inefficient technology. And the region is short \u2014 and this is a big deal. The region is short about 40 air traffic controllers,\u201d Gottheimer said. He said the tower was built back in \u201cthe Brady Bunch era\u201d in 1973.",
      "The FAA said earlier this week that it is installing new fiber optic data lines to carry the radar signal between its facilities in Philadelphia and New York. Officials said some of the lines connecting those two facilities are outdated copper wire that will be replaced. But it's not clear how quickly those repairs can be completed.",
      "U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said it's important that the FAA get the problems affecting the Newark airport fixed quickly.",
      "\u201cEnough is enough. The connection between New York air space and the Philadelphia air traffic control center must be fixed now. The backup system that is not working must be fixed. Now,\" Schumer said. \"This is an air travel safety emergency that requires immediate and decisive action, not a promise of a big, beautiful unfunded overhaul that will take years to begin to implement.\u201d",

      "The way President Donald Trump sees it, beating China in a trade war should be easy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The way President Donald Trump sees it, beating China in a trade war should be easy.",
      "After all, his logic goes, the Chinese sell Americans three times as much stuff as Americans sell them. Therefore, they have more to lose. Inflict enough pain, like the combined 145% taxes he slapped on Chinese imports last month, and they\u2019ll beg for mercy.",
      "Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent has confidently compared Beijing to a card player stuck with a losing hand. \u201cThey\u2019re playing with a pair of twos,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Somebody forgot to tell China. So far, the Chinese have refused to fold under the pressure of Trump\u2019s massive tariffs. Instead, they have retaliated with triple-digit tariffs of their own.",
      "\u201cAll bullies are just paper tigers,\u2019\u2019 the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared in a video last week. \u201cKneeling only invites more bullying.\u2019\u2019",
      "The stakes are high between the world\u2019s two biggest economies whose trade topped $660 billion last year. Bessent and Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, are heading to Geneva this weekend for initial trade talks with top Chinese officials. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "While businesses and investors welcome any easing of tensions, the prospects for a quick and significant breakthrough appear dim.",
      "\u201cThese are talks about talks, and China may be coming to assess what\u2019s on the table \u2014 or even just to buy time,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThere\u2019s no shared roadmap or clear pathway to de-escalation.\u201d",
      "But if the two countries eventually agree to scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they have slapped on each other\u2019s goods, it would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "\u201cThe companies involved in this trade on both sides just cannot afford waiting anymore,\u201d said economist John Gong of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. In a worst-case scenario, China could walk away from the negotiations if it feels the U.S. side isn\u2019t treating China as an equal or isn\u2019t willing to take the first step to deescalate, Gong said.",
      "\u201cI think if (Bessent) doesn\u2019t go into this negotiation with this kind of mindset, this could be very difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "For now, the two countries can\u2019t even agree on who requested the talks. \u201cThe meeting is being held at the request of the U.S. side,\u2019\u2019 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Wednesday. Trump disagreed. \u201cThey ought to go back and study their files,\u201d he said.",
      "What seems clear is that Trump\u2019s favorite economic weapon \u2014 import taxes, or tariffs \u2014 has not proved as mighty as he\u2019d hoped.",
      "\u201cFor Trump, what\u2019s happened here is that the rhetoric of his campaign has finally had to face economic reality,\u201d said Jeff Moon, a trade official in the Obama administration who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy. \u201cThe idea that he was going to bring China to its knees in terms of tariffs was never going to work.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump views tariffs an all-purpose economic tool that can raise money for the U.S. Treasury, protect American industries, lure factories to the United States and pressure other countries to bend to his will, even on issues such as immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "He used tariffs in his first term and has been even more aggressive and unpredictable about imposing them in his second. He\u2019s slapped a 10% tariff on almost every country in the world, blowing up the rules that had governed global trade for decades.",
      "But it\u2019s his trade war with China that has really put markets and businesses on edge. It started in February when he announced a 10% levy on Chinese imports. By April, Trump ratcheted up the taxes on China to a staggering 145%. Beijing upped its tariff on American products to 125%.",
      "Trump\u2019s escalation sent financial markets tumbling and left U.S. retailers warning that they might run out of goods as U.S.-China trade implodes. U.S. consumers, worried about the prospect of empty shelves and higher prices, are losing confidence in the economy.",
      "\u201cThis was not very well planned,\u2019\u2019 said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, senior fellow in China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI don\u2019t think he intended to have the tariffs escalate into this chaos.\u2019\u2019",
      "When Trump hit Chinese imports with tariffs during his first term, he charged that Beijing used unfair tactics, including cybertheft, to give its technology firms an edge.",
      "The two countries reached a truce \u2014 the so-called Phase One agreement \u2014 in January 2020; China agreed to buy more U.S. products, and Trump held off on even higher tariffs. But they didn\u2019t resolve the big issues dividing them, including China\u2019s subsidies of homegrown tech firms.",
      "China was ready for a rematch when Trump returned to the White House. It had worked to reduce its dependence on America\u2019s massive market, cutting the U.S. share of its exports to 15% last year from more than 19% in 2018, according to Dexter Roberts of the Atlantic Council.",
      "Beijing is confident that the Chinese people are more willing than Americans to endure the fallout from a trade war, including falling exports and shuttered factories. \u201cFor China, it\u2019s painful, but it\u2019s also imperative to withstand it, and it\u2019s prepared to cope with it,\u2019\u2019 said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center.",
      "In addition to miscalculating Chinese resolve, the Trump administration may have underestimated how much America relies on China.",
      "For decades, Americans have come to depend on Chinese factories. They produce 97% of America\u2019s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children\u2019s coloring books and 90% of its combs.",
      "\u201cWithout us, what do they have to sell?\u201d Chinese toymaker Cheng Zhengren told Beijing News. \u201cTheir shelves would be empty.\u201d",
      "The showerhead company Afina last month reported on an experiment suggesting that American consumers have little willingness to pay more for American-made products. Afina makes a filtered showerhead in China and Vietnam that retails for $129. Making the same product in America would lift the price to $239. When customers on the company\u2019s website were given a choice between them, 584 chose the cheap Asian one; not one opted for the costlier U.S.-made version.",
      "And it\u2019s not just consumers who depend on China. America\u2019s own factories do, too. The National Association of Manufacturers calculates 47% of U.S. imports from China in 2023 were \u201cmanufacturing inputs\u2019\u2019 \u2014 industrial supplies, auto parts and capital equipment that American manufacturers used to make other their own products domestically. So Trump\u2019s tariffs risk raising costs and reducing supplies that U.S. factories rely on, making them less competitive.",
      "Louise Loo, China economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, said that China\u2019s ability to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market in recent years means \u201cthey\u2019re probably likely to be able to find substitutes for buyers, much easier than the U.S. side will be able to find suppliers.\u201d",
      "Still, China won\u2019t emerge from a trade war unscathed either. Citing the impact of the trade war, the International Monetary Fund last month downgraded the outlook for the Chinese economy this year and next.",
      "\u201cChina needs the United States of America,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Friday\u2019s news briefing. \u201cThey need our markets. They need our consumer base. And Secretary Bessent knows that he\u2019s going to Switzerland this weekend with the full support and confidence and trust of the president here at home.\u201d",
      "Indeed Moon, who also served as a diplomat in China, noted the tariffs cut both ways: \u201cBoth of them are highly dependent on bilateral trade. They have put themselves in a corner.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jens Eskelund, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, expressed relief that U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting.",
      "\u201cSo good,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to the Vatican conclave that just picked a new pope as inspiration. \u201cLock them in a room and then hopefully white smoke will come out.\u201d",

Right now, you can\u2019t get any higher. It\u2019s at 145%. So we know it\u2019s coming down.\u201d He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be \u201csubstantive.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Commercial fishermen are eager to see if President Donald Trump's command to shed federal fishing regulations will boost one of the nation's oldest industries",
      "STONINGTON, Maine -- Virginia Olsen has pulled lobsters from Maine's chilly Atlantic waters for decades while watching threats to the state's lifeblood industry mount.",
      "Trade imbalances with Canada, tight regulations on fisheries and offshore wind farms towering like skyscrapers on open water pose three of those threats, said Olsen, part of the fifth generation in her family to make a living in the lobster trade.",
      "That's why she was encouraged last month when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that promises to restore American fisheries to their former glory. The order promises to shred fishing regulations, and Olsen said that will allow fishermen to do what they do best \u2014 fish.",
      "That will make a huge difference in communities like her home of Stonington, the busiest lobster fishing port in the country, Olsen said. It's a tiny island town of winding streets, swooping gulls and mansard roof houses with an economy almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing, some three hours up the coast from Portland, Maine's biggest city.",
      "Olsen knows firsthand how much has changed over the years. Hundreds of fish and shellfish populations globally have dwindled to dangerously low levels, alarming scientists and prompting the restrictions and catch limits that Trump's order could wash away with the stroke of a pen. But she's heartened that the livelihoods of people who work the traps and cast the nets have become a priority in faraway places where they often felt their voices weren't heard.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s time to have the conversation on what regulations that the industry does need. We\u2019re fishing different than we did 100 years ago,\" she said. \u201cIf everything is being looked at, we should be looking at the regulations within the fishing industry.\u201d",
      "But if fishing and lobstering interests finally have a seat at the table, the questions become how much seafood can be served there \u2014 and for how long. Trump's April 17 order, called \u201cRestoring American Seafood Competitiveness,\u201d promises an overhaul of the way America fishes, and cites a national seafood trade deficit of more than $20 billion as the reason to do it. The order calls on the federal government to reduce the regulatory burden on fishermen by later this month.",
      "It arrives at a time when conservation groups and many marine scientists say the ocean needs more regulation, not less. One oft-cited 2020 study led by a scientist at the University of British Columbia looked at more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations and found that 82% were below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields. The university said the study \u201cdiscovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species.\u201d",
      "Trump's order prioritizes commerce over conservation. It also calls for the development of a comprehensive seafood trade strategy and a review of existing marine monuments, which are underwater protected zones, to see if any should be opened for fishing. At least one, the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, has already been reopened.",
      "Many commercial fishermen and fishing trade groups lauded the order. Members of the industry, one of the oldest in the country, have long made the case that heavy regulations \u2014 many intended to protect the health of fish populations \u2014 leave the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to the fleets of countries that don't bear the same kind of burden. That disadvantage is a big piece of why America imports more than two-thirds of its seafood, they argue.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s executive order recognizes the challenges our fishing families and communities face, and we appreciate the commitment to reduce burdensome regulations and strengthen the competitiveness of American seafood,\u201d said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association.",
      "Some fishermen, including Maine lobsterman Don McHenan, said they're looking forward to members of the industry being able to fish in areas of the ocean that have been closed off to them for years. McHenan said he's also hopeful the pace of new regulations will slow.",
      "\u201cAs long as they don't put any more onto us,\u201d McHenan said. \u201cWe'll see \u2014 time will tell.\u201d",
      "But the support for deregulation is not unanimous among fishermen. Some say strong conservation laws are critical to protecting species that fishermen rely on to make a living.",
      "In Alaska, for example, Matt Wiebe said the executive order \u201cterrifies\u201d him. A commercial fisherman with more than 50 years of experience fishing for salmon, he said the order could potentially harm the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery, which has received praise from sustainability organizations for careful management of the fish supply.",
      "Absent that management, he said the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery could go the way of the New England cod fishing business, which collapsed due in large part to overfishing and has never recovered.",
      "\u201cSince New England fishers lost their cod fishery due to overfishing, many other fisheries came to respect and depend on conservation efforts,\u201d Wiebe said. \u201cWe fish because it's what we do, and conservation efforts mean we and our kids can fish into the future.\u201d",
      "The executive order arrived at a time when America's commercial fishermen are coping with environmental challenges and the decline of some once-marketable species. Maine's historic shrimp fishery shuttered more than a decade ago, California's salmon industry is struggling through closures and the number of fish stocks on the federal overfished list has grown in recent years.",
      "There is also the looming question of what Trump's trade war with major seafood producers such as Canada and China will mean for the U.S. industry \u2014 not to mention American consumers.",
      "To many in Maine's lobster and fishing business, the answer is clear: Cut regulations and let them do their thing.",
      "\u201cWe definitely feel the industry is over-regulated as a whole,\" said Dustin Delano, a fourth-generation Maine lobsterman who is also chief operating officer of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association. \u201cWe hope that this will help for sure. It does seek to initiate that America-first strategy in the fishery.\u201d",

      "Economists had forecast that China's global exports would grow about 2% in April, down from a whopping 12.4% year-on-year increase in March. Imports fell 0.2% in April from the year before.",
      "The data were released a day before U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other top U.S. officials were due to meet with Beijing's lead trade envoy, He Lifeng. The plans for talks in Geneva, Switzerland, could bring a shift in the stalemate over President Donald Trump's hikes in tariffs on Chinese good to as much as 145%.",
      "But the world's two biggest economies are at odds over a raft of issues, including colliding strategic interests that will likely impede progress in the talks.",
      "Some of the punitive tariffs, including Beijing's retaliatory 125% tariffs on U.S. exports, could be rolled back, but a full reversal is unlikely, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cThis means China\u2019s exports to the U.S. are set for further declines over the coming months, not all of which will be offset by increased trade with other countries. We still expect export growth to turn negative later this year,\u201d Huang said.",
      "China\u2019s politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States was nearly $20.5 billion in April, down from about $27.2 billion a year earlier. In the first four months of the year, China's exports to the United States fell 2.5% from a year earlier, while imports from the U.S. fell 4.7%.",
      "Preliminary data also show that U.S. imports from other countries not subject to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 145% tariff on Chinese products have been rising quickly.",
      "Exports to the United States form just a part of China's trade, and exports to the rest of the world have helped offset that weakness. Exports to Southeast Asian countries were up 11.5% from a year earlier in the first four months of this year. Exports to Latin America also climbed 11.5%. Shipments to India jumped nearly 16% by value, and exports to Africa surged 15%.",
      "Some of the fastest growth was in Asia, reflecting moves by Chinese and other manufacturers to diversify their supply chains outside of the Chinese mainland.",
      "Exports to Vietnam jumped 18% year-on-year, while exports to Thailand were up 20%.",
      "Measured on a monthly basis, China's total exports rose just 0.6% in April, while imports increased by nearly 4% from March.",

For sure I have to raise my level if I want to play even. \u2026 I\u2019m trying to understand where my game is so it\u2019s going to be a good challenge, good test for me.\u201d",
      "De Jong fell to the clay when he lost his footing trying to reach a passing shot from Sinner in the second set and the Italian came across the net to check on him. Sinner fetched a towel for De Jong and wiped off the Dutchman\u2019s racket handle.",
      "De Jong then needed medical attention for his right wrist before resuming play.",
      "Also reaching the fourth round was seventh-seeded Alex De Minaur, who beat Bolivian qualifier Hugo Dellien in a match that was interrupted twice during the first set \u2014 first when a spectator got sick and then because of a flyover by the Italian Air Force\u2019s acrobatic team.",
      "De Minaur was visibly frustrated by the flyover.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t handle it very well, because I got broken straight away,\u201d De Minaur said. \u201cI did well to bounce back and get the break back, but I\u2019ve got to be a little bit better mentally to not let those things, outside factors affect me.\u201d",

      "India great Virat Kohli has retired from test cricket after playing 123 matches in his glorious 14-year red-ball career",
      "NEW DELHI, India -- India great Virat Kohli retired from test cricket Monday after playing 123 matches in his glorious 14-year red-ball career.",
      "Kohli made his test debut in 2011 against West Indies and has been India's standout batter since Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s retirement in 2013.",
      "\u201cAs I step away from this format, it\u2019s not easy \u2014 but it feels right,\u201d Kohli posted on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket. Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It\u2019s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I\u2019ll carry for life.\u201d",
      "The 36-year-old Kohli\u2019s retirement comes only days after Rohit Sharma stepped down from test cricket, taking two senior batters out of selection contention for India's tour to England. India will need to select a new skipper and reshape its batting order for the five-test series starting June 20.",
      "Kohli scored 9,230 runs including 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries at a test batting average of 46.85. He also led India in 68 test matches and was India\u2019s most successful captain with 40 test wins.",
      "The former India captain is one of the highest-profile people in cricket, with 271 million followers on Instagram and almost 68 million on X, and he owns batting records in the longest and the limited-overs formats. He's expected to continue playing one-day international cricket, and he's still heavily involved in the lucrative Twenty20 Indian Premier League, which was suspended last Friday for a week following the escalating military tensions with Pakistan.",
      "Kohli said the traditions and ebbs and flows of the five-day format were special to him, including \u201cthe quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am walking away with a heart full of gratitude \u2014 for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,\u201d he wrote. \"I will always look back at my test career with a smile. #269, signing off.\u201d",
      "Kohli finished as India\u2019s fourth highest scorer in tests after Tendulkar (15,921), Rahul Dravid (13,265) and Sunil Gavaskar (10,122). He also scored the most double centuries for India in tests \u2014 seven \u2014 one more than the legendary Tendulkar.",
      "His crowning glory in test cricket, though, came as captain. His 40 test wins set a record for an India captain, surpassing MS Dhoni (27 from 60 tests) and Sourav Ganguly (21 from 49 tests).",
      "He finished fourth in the all-time list of most wins as test captain, behind South Africa\u2019s Graeme Smith (53 from 109 tests), and Australia\u2019s Ricky Ponting (48 from 77 tests) and Stephen Waugh (41 from 57 tests).",
      "Kohli also led India to the International Cricket Council's No. 1 ranking in test cricket after taking over from Dhoni in 2014-15, and helped his side maintain a stronghold on that position for five years.",
      "In 2018, he guided India to its first ever test series victory against Australia in Australia.",
      "Speculation over Kohli\u2019s test future has intensified since India's five-test tour of Australia finished in January. After scoring a 30th test hundred in Perth, Kohli\u2019s series tapered off and he finished it with 190 runs in nine innings at average 23.75. Still, his impact on the game in India and around the cricket world has been huge.",
      "\u201cThank you, Virat Kohli. An era ends in test cricket but the legacy will continue forever,\" the Board of Control for Cricket in India posted in a statement on X. \"His contributions to team India will forever be cherished!\u201d",

      "This time, the towel-waving home crowd helped spur Indiana, right from the start of a physical, sometimes chippy game.",
      "The Pacers built a 44-point lead before settling for an 80-39 halftime margin that matched the league\u2019s previous best since detailed play-by-play was kept, set by the Cavs in Game 2 of the 2017 Eastern Conference finals against Boston.",
      "Indiana did much of its damage without Bennedict Mathurin, one of its best scorers, who was ejected for a Flagrant 2 foul just 7 1/2 minutes into the game. And with Donovan Mitchell missing the second half because of an injured left ankle, the Cavs had no chance.",
      "Darius Garland led the Cavs with 21 points in his second game back from an injured toe. Mitchell finished with 12. Coach Kenny Atkinson said Mitchell would have an MRI exam Monday.",
      "\u201cComplete domination by them,\u201d Atkinson said briefly, before explaining at least the Cavs have two of the final three games on their home court. \u201cThey dominated us in every facet of the game.\u201d",
      "Indiana wasted no time taking control quickly with early runs of 11-2 and 13-0 to build a commanding 48-23 lead with 9:24 left in the first half. They didn\u2019t stop \u2014 or back down \u2014 there, either, closing the half on a 19-2 run",
      "Aaron Nesmith\u2019s buzzer-beating midrange jumper put the Pacers in another exclusive club \u2014 the 10th team in playoff history and second this week to score 80 points in the first half of a playoff game. Oklahoma City scored 87 points in Game 2 against Denver.",
      "Turner made all four of his 3-point attempts with Indianapolis 500 winners Dario Franchitti and Scott Dixon, WNBA Rookies of the Year Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston, and former NFL star Reggie Wayne in the crowd.",
      "\u201cWe felt the last game, they set the tone from a physical standpoint,\u201d Haliburton said after finishing with 11 points, five rebounds and five assists. \u201cToday, we came out and set the tone from the jump, really just rode that wave.\u201d",

      "Officials looked at Petrovic's goal for well over five minutes after the NHL's situation room initiated a video review to determine if he kicked the puck into the net for a 3-2 lead with 16:09 left. The final decision was that replays supported the referee's on-ice call that goalie Connor Hellebuyck propelled the puck into his own net.",
      "\u201cAt that point, you want them to take as much time as they need to get it right,\u201d said Stars coach Pete DeBoer, adding that the explanation he got was that Hellebuyck was trying to make a play on the puck.",
      "Jets coach Scott Arniel certainly didn't agree.",
      "\u201cThe rule states that if the puck gets kicked, if it hits a body or a stick of anybody else other than the goaltender, it counts as a goal. It hit our goaltender\u2019s stick and went in the net. That is no goal,\u201d Arniel said. \"So they said that Helly propelled the puck in, and I haven\u2019t seen the word propelled in the rulebook.\u201d",

      "Rantanen, who has 18 points this postseason, had the primary assist on a power-play goal by Hintz only 2:27 in for a 1-0 lead. When Dallas scored again late in the first period for a 2-1 lead, Rantanen was on the ice for defenseman Thomas Harley\u2019s goal, but the assists went to Granlund and Steel.",

      "Nino Niederreiter got Winnipeg even at 2 midway through the second period on his shot from the bottom of the right circle after Josh Morrissey made a nifty move to get around Stars center Colin Blackwell before making the pass for the score.",

      "Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles enhanced by unsuspected ally: artificial intelligence",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.",
      "The app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don't feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.",
      "Todd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers' time to create new puzzle boards. It would be \"extremely difficult,\" he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.",
      "Within the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods \u2014 be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not putting chatbots into the game. We\u2019re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,\u201d Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.\u201d",
      "In the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.",
      "Candy Crush \u2014 first launched on Facebook in 2012 \u2014 is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.",
      "The free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of \u201cOne Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.\u201d Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a \u201cravenous set of players,\" he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.",
      "\u201cTo supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.\u201d",
      "King uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they're still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun \u201con first contact.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hard for us to do, because we don\u2019t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.\u201d",
      "Green said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design \u201cloop\u201d of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.",
      "\u201cDoing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.\u201d",
      "For most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the \u201cup and down.\u201d Levels aren't designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they're able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.",
      "\u201cWe talk to players all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?\u201d",
      "To determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate \u2014 how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts \u2014 and how often a board is \u201creshuffled,\u201d or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for different people.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- For many experts, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s promise for \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d to find autism's causes in a few months is jarring \u2014 and unrealistic.",
      "That\u2019s because it appears to ignore decades of science linking about 200 genes that play a role \u2014 and the quest to understand differences inside the brain that can be present at birth.",
      "\u201cVirtually all the evidence in the field suggests whatever the causes of autism \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be multiple causes, it\u2019s not going to be a single cause \u2014 they all affect how the fetal brain develops,\u201d said longtime autism researcher David Amaral of the UC Davis MIND Institute.",
      "\u201cEven though we may not see the behaviors associated with autism until a child is 2 or 3 years old, the biological changes have already taken place,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy on Wednesday announced the National Institutes of Health would create a new database \u201cto uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases\u201d by merging Medicaid and Medicare insurance claims with electronic medical records and other data. He has cited rising autism rates as evidence of an epidemic of a \u201cpreventable disease\u201d caused by some sort of environmental exposure and has promised \u201csome of the answers by September.\u201d",
      "Autism isn\u2019t considered a disease. It's a complex brain disorder better known as autism spectrum disorder, to reflect that it affects different people in different ways.",
      "Symptoms vary widely. For some people, profound autism means being nonverbal and having significant intellectual disabilities. Others have far milder effects, such as difficulty with social and emotional skills.",
      "Autism rates are rising \u2014 not among profound cases but milder ones, said autism expert Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University.",
      "That's because doctors gradually learned that milder symptoms were part of autism\u2019s spectrum, leading to changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s in diagnosis guidelines and qualifications for educational services, she said.",
      "The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.",
      "But that's not the only kind. As the brain develops, rapidly dividing cells make mistakes that can lead to mutations in only one type of cell or one part of the brain, Amaral explained.",
      "Noninvasive testing can spot differences in brain activity patterns in babies who won't be diagnosed with autism until far later, when symptoms become apparent, he said.",
      "Those kinds of changes stem from alterations in brain structure or its neural circuitry \u2014 and understanding them requires studying brain tissue that\u2019s available only after death, said Amaral, who\u2019s the scientific director of a brain banking collaborative called Autism BrainNet. The bank, funded by the nonprofit Simons Foundation, has collected more than 400 donated brains, about half from people with autism and the rest for comparison.",
      "Researchers have identified other factors that can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of autism. They include the age of a child\u2019s father, whether the mother had certain health problems during pregnancy including diabetes, use of certain medications during pregnancy, and preterm birth.",
      "Any concern that measles vaccinations could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stressed Tager-Flusberg, who leads a new Coalition of Autism Scientists pushing back on administration misstatements about the condition.",
      "The U.S., with its fragmented health care system, will never have the kind of detailed medical tracking available in countries like Denmark and Norway \u2014 places with national health systems where research shows similar rises in autism diagnoses and no environmental smoking gun.",
      "Experts say Kennedy's planned database isn't appropriate to uncover autism's causes in part because there's no information about genetics.",
      "But researchers have long used insurance claims and similar data to study other important questions, such as access to autism services. And the NIH described the upcoming database as useful for studies focusing on access to care, treatment effectiveness and other trends.",

      "Google will pay $1.4 billion to Texas to settle claims the company collected users' data without permission, the state\u2019s attorney general announced Friday.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton described the settlement as sending a message to tech companies that he will not allow them to make money off of \u201cselling away our rights and freedoms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn Texas, Big Tech is not above the law.\" Paxton said in a statement. \u201cFor years, Google secretly tracked people\u2019s movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.\u201d",
      "The agreement settles several claims Texas made against the search giant in 2022 related to geolocation, incognito searches and biometric data. The state argued Google was \u201cunlawfully tracking and collecting users\u2019 private data.\u201d",
      "Paxton claimed, for example, that Google collected millions of biometric identifiers, including voiceprints and records of face geometry, through such products and services as Google Photos and Google Assistant.",
      "Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda said the agreement settles an array of \u201cold claims,\u201d some of which relate to product policies the company has already changed.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased to put them behind us, and we will continue to build robust privacy controls into our services,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "The company also clarified that the settlement does not require any new product changes.",
      "Paxton said the $1.4 billion is the largest amount won by any state in a settlement with Google over this type of data-privacy violations.",
      "Texas previously reached two other key settlements with Google within the last two years, including one in December 2023 in which the company agreed to pay $700 million and make several other concessions to settle allegations that it had been stifling competition against its Android app store.",
      "Meta has also agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement with Texas in a privacy lawsuit over allegations that the tech giant used users' biometric data without their permission.",

      "Courts across the country have been grappling with how to deal with the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in the courtroom",
      "Stacey Wales gripped the lectern, choking back tears as she asked the judge to give the man who shot and killed her brother the maximum possible sentence for manslaughter.",
      "What appeared next stunned those in the Phoenix courtroom last week: An AI-generated video with a likeness of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, told the shooter he was forgiven.",
      "The judge said he loved and appreciated the video, then sentenced the shooter to 10.5 years in prison \u2014 the maximum sentence and more than what prosecutors sought. Within hours of the hearing on May 1, the defendant's lawyer filed a notice of appeal.",
      "Defense attorney Jason Lamm won't be handling the appeal, but said a higher court will likely be asked to weigh in on whether the judge improperly relied on the AI-generated video when sentencing his client.",
      "Courts across the country have been grappling with how to best handle the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in the courtroom. Even before Pelkey\u2019s family used AI to give him a voice for the victim impact portion \u2014 believed to be a first in U.S. courts \u2014 the Arizona Supreme Court created a committee that researches best AI practices.",
      "In Florida, a judge recently donned a virtual reality headset meant to show the point of view of a defendant who said he was acting in self-defense when he waved a loaded gun at wedding guests. The judge rejected his claim.",
      "And in New York, a man without a lawyer used an AI-generated avatar to argue his case in a lawsuit via video. It took only seconds for the judges to realize that the man addressing them from the video screen wasn't real.",
      "Experts say using AI in courtrooms raises legal and ethical concerns, especially if it's used effectively to sway a judge or jury. And they argue it could have a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities facing prosecution.",
      "\u201cI imagine that will be a contested form of evidence, in part because it could be something that advantages parties that have more resources over parties that don\u2019t,\" said David Evan Harris, an expert on AI deep fakes at UC Berkeley\u2019s business school.",
      "AI can be very persuasive, Harris said, and scholars are studying the intersection of the technology and manipulation tactics.",
      "Cynthia Godsoe, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former public defender, said as this technology continues to push the boundaries of traditional legal practices, courts will have to confront questions they have never before had to weigh: Does this AI photograph really match the witness's testimony? Does this video exaggerate the suspect's height, weight, or skin color?",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a disturbing trend,\" she said, \u201cbecause it could veer even more into fake evidence that maybe people don't figure out is false.\u201d",
      "In the Arizona case, the victim's sister told The Associated Press that she did consider the \u201cethics and morals\u201d of writing a script and using her brother's likeness to give him a voice during the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cIt was important to us to approach this with ethics and morals and to not use it to say things that Chris wouldn\u2019t say or believe,\" Stacey Wales said.",
      "Victims can give their impact statements in any digital format in Arizona, said victims\u2019 rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family.",
      "When the video played in the courtroom, Wales said only she and her husband knew about it.",
      "\u201cThe goal was to humanize Chris and to reach the judge,\u201d Wales said.",
      "After viewing it, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang said he \u201cloved the beauty in what Christopher\u201d said in the AI video.",
      "\u201cIt also says something about the family,\" he said. \u201cBecause you told me how angry you were, and you demanded the maximum sentence, and even though that's what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it.\u201d",
      "On appeal, the defendant's lawyer said, the judge's comments could be a factor for the sentence to be overturned.",

      "Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps \u201cclearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms,\u201d said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",
      "The new work showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms, with western chimps preferring a more even beat while eastern chimps used varied short and long intervals between beats. The research was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "It's well-known that chimps use tools such as rocks to crack open nuts and sticks to \u201cfish\u201d termites from their mounds. Tree roots can also be tools, the researchers say.",
      "Chimps are selective about which roots they pound, said co-author Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France. Certain shapes and wood varieties create sounds that travel well through dense jungle.",

While space debris trackers around the world converged in their forecasts, it was still too soon to know exactly when and where the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 would come down. That uncertainty was due to potential solar activity and the spacecraft\u2019s old condition. Its parachutes were expected to be useless by now and its batteries long dead.",

      "WASHINGTON -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives from Microsoft and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices testified on Capitol Hill about the biggest opportunities, risks and needs facing an industry which lawmakers and technologists agree could fundamentally transform global business, culture and geopolitics.",
      "The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.",
      "\u201cI believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,\u201d Altman said in his opening remarks about AI\u2019s potential to transform society. \u201cFor that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.\u201d Altman urged senators to help usher in the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d of artificial intelligence and energy production that \u201cwill change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.\u201d",
      "The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. They four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising.",
      "The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union.",
      "\u201cChina aims to lead the world in AI by 2030,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \u201cIn this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?\u201d",
      "Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.",
      "Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.",
      "And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as \u201ca self sabotaging attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?\u201d asked Duckworth.",
      "But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.",
      "\u201cLook, there is a race, but we need to understand what we\u2019re racing for,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We\u2019re trying to win a race so that American values prevail.\u201d",
      "Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe totally understand as an industry the importance of national security,\u201d Su said. But she added, if not able to \u201chave our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.\u201d Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.",
      "Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.",
      "\u201cThe leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it\u2019s no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.\u201d",
      "Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.",
      "The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.",
      "Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China\u2019s \u201csophisticated smuggling operations\u201d to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.",
      "The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden\u2019s \u201coverly complex, overly bureaucratic\u201d rule with a simpler one but didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.",
      "Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been \u201cunbelievable\" in incentivizing major AI projects. \u201cI think that would be a good thing for other states to study,\u201d Altman said.

      "New experiments show eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs.",
      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",
      "It's a bit counterintuitive that the oblong side of an egg could hold up better against a tumble, said study co-author Tal Cohen with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration is also considering flight reductions.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration is considering temporary flight reductions in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, and it's launching an emergency task force to ensure safety, among other system upgrades announced by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy at a press conference on Monday.",
      "Duffy blamed recent telecommunications issues at Newark Liberty International Airport on former President Joe Biden's administration, claiming that it mishandled a move of air traffic control from New York to Philadelphia in 2024.",
      "He said that the administration had moved the terminal radar approach control, or TRACON, \"without properly hardening the telecom lines feeding the data.\"",
      "\"Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden did nothing to fix this system that they knew was broken,\" he said, casting blame on his predecessor under Biden.",
      "\"Without addressing the underlying infrastructure, they added more risk to the system,\" he added.",
      "Duffy\u2019s allegations come after an equipment issue on Sunday prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to order a 45-minute ground stop at the New Jersey airport.",
      "However, Duffy claimed that the issue did not technically result in an outage -- because the FAA had just performed a software update on the backup system on Friday night to prevent future outages.",
      "\"The software patch was successful, and our redundant lines are now both working,\" he said, confirming that the main line went down on Sunday -- but the backup line did not.",
      "It was only out of \"an abundance of caution\" that traffic controllers shut down the airspace for 45 minutes on Sunday, Duffy explained.",
      "Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau also appeared at the press conference on Monday and announced that the agency was launching an emergency task force to ensure that travel in and out of Newark remains safe and efficient.",
      "The task force comprises experts from the FAA, Verizon and L3Harris -- an FAA contractor that purports to focus on \"advanced defense and commercial technologies.\"",
      "Sunday\u2019s incident marks the fourth time in the past two weeks that technical problems have disrupted air traffic at Newark.",
      "Duffy also noted that the telecoms system's age contributed to recent issues.",
      "\"The system is so old that even when you have high-speed fiber information coming in ... the information has to be slowed down, it comes in too fast,\" Duffy said, saying that the information could only travel at \"the speed of copper wires.\"",
      "For that reason he said that the FAA has replaced copper lines with fiber lines at Newark, along with New York City's LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport.",
      "The new lines are currently being tested, he said, and the agency hopes to make the switch and have them fully operational by the end of May.",
      "\"The goal is to add three new telecommunications lines between New York and Philadelphia,\" Duffy added. \"This will provide more high-speed reliability and redundancy -- so if one goes down, we're assured that the others will stand up.\"",
      "Additionally, the FAA will be meeting with airlines on Wednesday to discuss potential flight reductions at the Newark, he said, echoing an announcement made last week by the FAA. The move would be an effort to reduce ongoing flight delays to and from the airport.",
      "During the meeting, the airlines will confidentially propose flight cuts to the agency based on the congested timeframes identified by the FAA.",
      "United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby announced on May 2 that the airline was \"unilaterally\" cutting 35 daily roundtrips from its Newark schedule after several air traffic controllers went on medical leave following the April 28 outage. Newark often has 80 or more flights per hour, Kirby noted in the statement, calling the number unsustainable.",
      "If approved, flight reductions are expected to stay in effect all summer. A final decision will be made after the meeting, and the order will be submitted to the Federal Register by the FAA.",
      "Duffy said that the FAA is closely working with Verizon and L3Harris to determine the underlying cause of the recurring telecommunications issues and address them in an expedited manner.",
      "He also said that he is asking the Office of Inspector General to conduct an investigation into decisions made by the last administration that might be linked to recent equipment failures.",
      "Rocheleau reiterated that traveling in and out of Newark remains safe, and the task force will continue to monitor the upgrades announced by Duffy.",

    "story": [
      "The 220 top crypto coin holders have won tickets to a dinner gala with Trump.",
      "The race to win tickets to an exclusive crypto dinner gala with President Donald Trump at his private golf club in Virginia on May 22 ended with top 220 holders of the Trump meme coin winning invitations to the black tie gala, the coin's official X account announced Monday.",
      "A \"leaderboard\" of the top 220 holders appearing on the website did not display the identities of the winners, but it listed numerous wallets that some crypto experts have linked to possible foreign individuals and entities, heightening concerns about potential conflicts of interest arising from the Trump family's businesses and foreign interests.",
      "According to the meme coin's website, the top 25 \"VIP holders\" were also invited to what it described as an \"Exclusive Reception before Dinner\" and a \"Special VIP Tour.\"",
      "As the Trump family stands to potentially take in tens of millions of dollars from the coin's transactions and possibly even more from its ownership of the coin, the price of Trump's meme coin has been in constant fluctuation over the past three weeks, with numerous supporters and crypto enthusiasts flocking to purchase the coin to secure a seat at the gala while numerous others sell the coin to profit off the hype.",
      "The coin's price dropped rapidly on Monday as the competition ended, and was priced at $12.59 as of 4 p.m. ET. When the gala competition was first announced last year, the coin's price jumped by more than 55% and later reached a high of nearly $16.42, according to Coinbase.com.",
      "While fluctuations in the Trump coin's price have resulted in massive profits for a fortunate few, hundreds of thousands of investors have reportedly lost money on the coin. According to CNBC's reporting of blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis' data, roughly 764,000 crypto wallets have lost money on Trump meme coin investments, while 58 wallets have made millions from their Trump coin investments.",
      "Although the coin's website had earlier advertised a \"Special VIP White House tour\" for the top 25 coin holders, as of Monday afternoon it simply said \"Special VIP tour,\" without mentioning the White House. Additionally, the website included a disclaimer saying the tour is being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself is appearing as a \"guest.\"",
      "In its social media announcement about the conclusion of the contest, the post also announced a \"rewards points program\" and the awarding of \"exclusive NFTs\" for the winners.",
      "According to crypto experts, the wallet of the top coin holder -- nicknamed \"Sun\" and currently holding roughly $16.6 million worth of the Trump meme coin -- is owned by a foreign crypto exchange advised by Chinese billionaire Justin Sun, who recently moderated a panel discussion between Eric Trump and Zack Witkoff at a crypto conference in Dubai, where Witkoff announced the other Trump family crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, had partnered in a $2 billion business deal with an Abu Dahbi state-backed investment firm. Justin Sun did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Sun is also one of World Liberty Financials' biggest investors, purchasing $75 million worth of its coin the day before Trump's inauguration earlier this year. A month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun, who along with his companies has denied wrongdoing.",
      "The second top holder, a Singaporean entity identified by crypto experts as likely being MemeCore, and nicknamed \"MeCo,\" has been more vocal about their race to secure a VIP ticket -- publicly soliciting followers to send Trump coin to their wallet so they can achieve \"#1 on the $TRUMP leaderboard\" and \"conquer the entire meme space,\" with the promise of returning the tokens after the event.",
      "In all, the top 220 folders hold a total of 13.7 million Trump coins, valued at nearly $14 million as of 4 p.m. ET Monday, according to Coinbase.com.",
      "Notably, 17 out of the top 220 coin holders on the leaderboard, including one in the top 25, appeared to hold zero Trump coin as of Monday afternoon -- possibly meaning that they sold their holdings before the contest ended.",
      "Experts say this is possible because the top 220 holders were chosen based on \"time weighted holdings,\" which were calculated based on \"both the amount and duration\" of one's holdings from April 23 through May 12. \"The longer you hold, the higher your weighted score becomes,\" the website says.",
      "It's not clear if the zero Trump coin holders will get invited to the event.",

      "Republicans brush off criticism over things they say aren't in the proposal.",
      "With massive changes to Medicaid on the horizon, House Republicans acknowledged they do not anticipate receiving a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office before their markup at the Energy and Commerce Committee -- leaving a cloud of political uncertainty over the impact of their proposals as they aim at achieving at least $880 billion in savings.",
      "Nevertheless, a new letter sent Monday from the CBO to committee Chairman Brett Guthrie confirms that the panel's legislative recommendations, released late Sunday, would meet its lofty target for $880 billion of savings over the next decade.",
      "\"CBO estimates that the Committee's reconciliation recommendations would reduce deficits by more than $880 billion over the 2025-2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits in any year after 2034,\" CBO director Phillip Swagel wrote Monday.",
      "But that's about as much as Republicans expect to hear from CBO prior to their markup on Tuesday, with Republican committee aides conceding that \"we are not holding our breath\" for a full analysis of their bill.",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised on the campaign trail and in the White House not to cut Medicaid and he and Republicans said they'll come up with the savings by cutting waste and fraud in the program.",
      "He gave House Republicans' effort a boost on Monday as he headed off on a four-day trip to the Middle East, urging Republicans to \"UNIFY\" around the bill and saying the executive order he signed Monday that would \"slash the cost of prescription drugs\" and the \"hundreds of billions of tariff money coming in\" should be factored into the bill's scoring.",
      "\"The Bill is GREAT. We have no alternative, WE MUST WIN!\" he posted on Truth Social. \"But now, with the tremendous Drug and Pharmaceutical Cuts, plus massive incoming Tariff Money, our \"GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\" just got much BIGGER and BETTER.",
      "As Democrats highlight prior CBO analysis of a menu of legislative options showing millions could lose Medicaid insurance by 2034, Republicans insist that criticism is misguided because it does not encompass their actual policy revisions included in their bill.",
      "\"So when you're citing the 13 million coverage loss, those are including policies that are not in our bill,\" a Republican committee aide told reporters at a briefing at the Capitol on Monday. \"So if you want to stick to the provisions that are in the bill, we'll have that information from CBO as soon as it's ready.\"",
      "Asked to quantify the savings anticipated through work requirements for Medicaid recipients, Republican aides again begged off of an answer -- urging patience for CBO's pending analysis.",
      "\"It is a big driver in savings for us. But it's hard to ascribe particular scores to individual policies at this stage of the game, because of how interactive everything is with each other,\" an aide explained. \"A policy that saves X amount of money on its own -- that changes when you're interacting with a lot of different policies in the same space. So I don't really [want] tell you it's X amount before CBO is ready to do that.\"",
      "Republicans also criticized Democrats for twice baiting CBO into hypothetical analyses that were not necessarily intended to be published.",
      "\"I would really encourage folks to be mindful before just putting whatever number is in our counterpart's press releases to actually look at what the CBO would know that they chose to publish, what is actually in the bill and related to the bill, and what is not. But again, it is pretty irresponsible to put that information out there before CBO is ready to actually publish it.\"",
      "Republicans have a 29-23 edge at the committee, so the marathon markup is expected to succeed -- putting the bill on a path to be included in the full reconciliation bill.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson can afford to lose only three GOP defections in a full vote of the whole House, and some hardliners are already signaling a brewing battle once the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" comes to the floor.",
      "\"I sure hope House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan\u2026. \u2026.. because I'm not here to rack up an additional $20 trillion in debt over 10 years or to subsidize healthy, able-bodied adults, corrupt blue states, and monopoly hospital ceos\u2026\" Texas Republican Rep.

      "All imports of live cattle, horse and bison from the southern border have been banned due to the spread of a flesh-eating pest in Mexico, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Sunday.",
      "\"The protection of our animals and safety of our nation's food supply is a national security issue of the utmost importance,\" USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a press release.",
      "The secretary cited New World Screwworm (NWS), a parasitic fly, as the reason for the suspension of imports. The name refers to the way in which maggots screw themselves into the tissue of animals with their sharp mouth hooks, causing extensive damage and often leading to death.",
      "Panama saw NWS infections among livestock rise from an average of 25 cases annually to over 6,500 in 2023. Since then, the disease has spread further north, breaking a previously established barrier that contained the pest to South America for decades, the USDA said.",
      "Infections have been detected in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Belize.",
      "More recently, a case was reported in Mexico late last year, which also shut down the border for live animal trade. Imports resumed earlier this year after an agreement between the U.S. and Mexico to mitigate the threat of the disease.",
      "The continued spread and threat of NWS led to the current shutdown, which will continue on a month-by-month basis, \"until a significant window of containment is achieved,\" the USDA said. The disease was recently detected in remote farms about 700 miles from the U.S. border.",
      "Eradicating the disease is possible through a technique in which male screwworm flies are sterilized and then released into the environment to mate with females until the population dies out. This process was used to rid the U.S. of NWS in the 1960s.",
      "The eradication efforts yielded estimated economic benefits of nearly $800 million annually for American livestock producers in 1996, with an estimated $2.8 billion for the wider economy, according to the USDA.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials are working to release sterile flies by both air and ground along parts of Southern Mexico and in other regions in Central America.",
      "\"Once we see increased surveillance and eradication efforts, and the positive results of those actions, we remain committed to opening the border for livestock trade,\" Rollins said. \"This is not about politics or punishment of Mexico, rather it is about food and animal safety.\"",

      "Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King has became the second major Republican to enter the 2026 race to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen Jon Ossoff",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King on Monday became the second major Republican to enter the 2026 race to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen Jon Ossoff, saying \u201cPresident Trump needs reinforcements and Georgia needs a new senator.\u201d",
      "King jumped in after U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced Friday that she would not seek the Republican nomination for Senate, and a week after King's political patron, Gov. Brian Kemp, made the same decision.",
      "U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, a Republican who represents a coastal Georgia district, announced his campaign for the Senate after Kemp announced he wasn't running.",
      "Five other GOP officeholders have acknowledged interest to The Associated Press, signaling what could be a wide-open Republican contest. They include two other Republicans in Congress, Mike Collins and Rich McCormick. Also considering the race are Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, state Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and state Sen. Greg Dolezal.",
      "King, 61, emphasized his biography in his announcement, including being born in Mexico, his rise to major general in the Georgia National Guard and his work in law enforcement as an Atlanta police officer and Doraville police chief.",
      "\u201cI've never shied away from a fight, but what truly scares me today is having Jon Ossoff for six more years. President Trump got sent to Washington, D.C., to solve some very big problems,\" King said in an announcement video. \"He needs help and I'm asking for your support to go help President Trump and solve these incredibly big problems.\u201d",
      "King said Monday that he had been stabbed and shot while serving as an Atlanta police officer. He also was a member of the Atlanta Police Department's Red Dog unit, an anti-crime task force that drew widespread criticism for its aggressive tactics.",
      "It was King's experience in the National Guard that brought him to Kemp's attention. King had never held elective office and had lost out on his application to be Kemp's National Guard chief when Kemp was faced with filling a vacancy in the insurance commissioner's office after Jim Beck was indicted on federal criminal charges and suspended in 2019. Kemp chose King, saying he would \u201crestore trust\u201d in the office after not only Beck but also his predecessor John Oxendine faced criminal charges.",
      "King held the post on an interim basis for years, and Kemp appointed him permanently after Beck was convicted in 2022. Later that year, King became the first Hispanic person to be elected to a statewide post in Georgia.",
      "Kemp has made a number of appointments to diversify what has traditionally been an overwhelmingly white and male group of Republican officeholders. Fluent in Spanish, King often delivered messages on behalf of Kemp in that language during the pandemic, and released announcement videos Monday in both English and Spanish.",
      "King was also a key messenger during Kemp's successful push to limit civil lawsuit verdicts and has become a frequent speaker at political events the last two years. But King, like a number of other Senate hopefuls, remains little-known by the broader electorate.",
      "He also needs to prove that he can raise the large amounts of money needed for a Senate campaign. He raised $1 million during his 2022 reelection campaign, enough for a low-profile statewide office but not for a competitive Republican primary. Overall, the 2026 Senate race is likely to cost hundreds of millions. Ossoff raised more than $11 million just in the first three months of 2025.",

Whenever people talked about it -- it was always like -- the -- you know, America is such a powerful nation. The church was always a little suspicious about having, you know, the pres-, the pope being an American. But I think for Leo -- I'm still trying to get used to calling him that -- it is something that he is certainly grew up in America. He's a native Chicago. He loves Chicago, his family, his brother still lives there. He comes back here whenever he can. He has friends in the area. But his -- his world experience has not really been in America. So, he -- he's served a very short time here in the United States as an Augustinian.

      "Harvard University has responded to threats from the Education Department to halt grant funding to the Ivy League school",
      "BOSTON -- Harvard University responded Monday to recent threats from the Education Department to halt its grant funding, highlighting reforms it was undertaking but warning it won't budge on \u201cits core, legally-protected principles\u201d over fears of retaliation.",
      "A letter from Harvard President Alan Garber detailed how the institution had made significant changes to its leadership and governance over the past year and a half. Among the reforms, Garber said, was a broad \u201cstrategy to combat antisemitism and other bigotry.\u201d",
      "Last week, the Department of Education threatened a grant freeze in a major escalation of Trump\u2019s battle with the Ivy League school. The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, and Trump is pushing to strip the school of its tax-exempt status.",
      "Garber warned that its efforts to change were being \u201cundermined and threatened by the federal government\u2019s overreach into the constitutional freedoms of private universities and its continuing disregard of Harvard\u2019s compliance with the law.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsistent with the law and with our own values, we continue to pursue needed reforms, doing so in consultation with our stakeholders and always in compliance with the law,\u201d Garber wrote. \u201cBut Harvard will not surrender its core, legally-protected principles out of fear of unfounded retaliation by the federal government.\u201d",
      "An Education Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In call with reporters last week, a Department of Education official accused Harvard of \u201cserious failures.\u201d The person, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Harvard has allowed antisemitism and racial discrimination to perpetuate, it has abandoned rigorous academic standards, and it has failed to allow a range of views on its campus.",
      "To become eligible for new grants, Harvard would need to enter negotiations with the federal government and prove it has satisfied the administration\u2019s requirements.",
      "The demands come amid a pressure campaign targeting several other high-profile universities. The administration has cut off money to colleges including Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University, seeking compliance with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "The White House says it\u2019s targeting campus antisemitism after pro-Palestinian protests swept U.S. college campuses last year. It\u2019s also focused on the participation of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports. And the attacks on Harvard increasingly have called out the university\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, along with questions about freedom of speech and thought by conservatives on campus.",
      "Harvard has filed a federal lawsuit over the administration\u2019s demands, setting up a closely watched clash in Trump\u2019s attempt to force change at universities that he says have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism.",
      "In his letter Monday, Garber also attempted to rebut many of the allegations made by the Education Department. He insisted admission to Harvard was based on \u201cacademic excellence and promise\u201d and there were no \u201cquotas, whether based on race or ethnicity or any other characteristic\u201d or an \u201cideological litmus tests\u201d when it comes to hiring.",
      "Garber also dismissed the suggestion that Harvard was a partisan institution and said he wasn\u2019t aware of any evidence suggesting international students were \u201cmore prone to disruption, violence, or other misconduct than any other students.\u201d",
      "___ Collin Binkley has covered Harvard for nearly a decade \u2013 most of the time living half a mile from campus.",

    "story": [
      "Illinois is getting set to close on property that officials want to buy to keep invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes",
      "A stalemate between President Donald Trump and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker that threatened a $1.2 billion plan to keep invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes appears to have been settled after the Trump administration offered assurances it will cover its share of the costs.",
      "After a delay that has stretched on since February, Illinois officials are set to resume closing on property they need to continue work on a project that will generate vast bubble curtains to deter the carp, stun them with electrical fields and play sound frequencies to disorient them.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers along with state officials in Illinois and Michigan have been planning since 2020 to install a gantlet of technologies in the Des Plaines River near Joliet, Illinois, to deter invasive carp from entering Lake Michigan.",
      "The Corps and the states signed a deal in 2024 to work together on the project using $226 million allocated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And elements of the Water Resources Development Act adopted last year call for the federal government to cover 90% of operating and maintenance costs.",
      "Construction on the project began in January. Pritzker's administration was set to close in February on a parcel of property for the project and transfer it to the Corps.",
      "Everything appeared on track until late January, when the Trump administration froze federal grants and loans as it reviewed whether spending aligned with Trump's priorities on issues such as climate change and diversity. The administration rescinded the freeze less than two days later but questions persist about the federal government's spending commitments.",
      "Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel empire and a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, is one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics. He has described the early months of the Trump administration as \u201ctrue villainous cruelty by a few idiots.\u201d",
      "Days before Illinois was to finalize a property deal for the carp project, Pritzker hit pause and demanded assurances that the federal government would honor its spending commitment. Site preparation has continued since then, but substantial work to install technology has been on hold.",
      "The White House issued a memo late Friday saying the Trump administration recognized the threat invasive carp pose to Great Lakes recreation and fishing and that it's committed to protecting the lakes.",
      "The federal government is prepared to do its part so long as states cooperate, according to the memo, which calls on Illinois to complete the property deal by July 1 and promises the federal government will streamline permitting and environmental reviews.",
      "\u201cMy Administration fully supports preventing the spread of invasive carp,\u201d the memo said. \u201cThe State of Illinois, where the (project) is located, must cease further delay in cooperating with this effort, for the sake of its own citizens and economy and for the sake of all of the Great Lake States.\u201d",
      "Pritzker's office issued a news release late Friday evening saying the governor was satisfied.",
      "Work on the project isn't slated to finish until 2032, but Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Alliance for the Great Lakes, said Monday that prospects suddenly look dramatically better than they did last week.",
      "\u201cWe're back to business as usual. That's a good thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Four species of carp were imported to the U.S. from Asia in the 1960s and 1970s to clear algae from sewage ponds and fish farms in the Deep South. They escaped into the Mississippi River and have moved north into dozens of tributaries in the central U.S.",
      "Government agencies, advocacy groups and others have long debated how to prevent the fish from reaching the Great Lakes, where scientists say they could out-compete native species for food and habitat in waterways where the fishing industry is valued at $7 billion.",
      "A shipping canal that forms part of the link between the Mississippi and Lake Michigan has a network of fish-repelling barriers, which the Corps says is effective, but critics consider inadequate.",
      "The new project at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River near Joliet will provide another layer of protection at a downstream choke point between the Illinois River, which is infested with invasive carp, and Lake Michigan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful everyone is taking this project seriously now and we\u2019re not going to see any more delays,\u201d Brammeier said.",

      "President Donald Trump 's readiness to accept a luxury jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar for conversion into a presidential aircraft has revived the conversations around emoluments and the notion of a president otherwise allegedly profiting off of the office.",
      "\u201cI would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,\u201d he told reporters on Monday, after being asked if Qatar was getting anything in return for the plane. \u201cI could be a stupid person and say, \u2018no, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there are constitutional prohibitions against the president receiving gifts from foreign entities or even domestic ones. It's a conversation over emoluments, territory that Trump has been forced to navigate, and litigate, in the past.",
      "Simply, an emolument is compensation for services, from employment or holding office, that can take the form of a salary, fee or profit.",
      "There are separate emoluments delineations in the U.S. Constitution. Both are aimed at preserving the independence of the president from influence from outside entities, including Congress, states and foreign governments.",
      "Article I bars anyone holding government office from accepting any present, emolument, office or title from any \u201cKing, Prince, or foreign State,\u201d without congressional consent.",
      "Article II deals with domestic emoluments, noting that Congress can't increase or decrease the president's compensation during his term in office, and prohibits the president from receiving any emolument from the states.",
      "Trump has reportedly been offered a Boeing 747-8 by Qatar in an arrangement that could be formalized as he travels to the Middle East this week. The Qatari government has said a final decision hasn't been made. But Trump has defended the idea as a fiscally smart move for the country, even as critics argue it would amount to a president accepting an astonishingly valuable gift from a foreign government.",
      "\u201cIf we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they\u2019re building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\u201d Trump said Monday at the White House.",
      "The luxury 747 \u2014 currently parked at Palm Beach International Airport, close to Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago resort \u2014 would be donated to a future presidential library. Trump has said that he wouldn\u2019t use it for personal travel after leaving office, suggesting that it would be decommissioned like the Boeing 707 that Ronald Reagan flew on in the 1980s, and which is currently on display at Reagan's presidential library in Simi Valley, California.",
      "There are other Trump-related deals with Qatar. Last month, the Trump family company struck a deal to build a luxury golf resort there, in a sign it has no plans to hold back from foreign dealmaking during a second Trump administration.",
      "The project, which features Trump-branded beachside villas and an 18-hole golf course to be built by a Saudi Arabian company, marked the first foreign deal by the Trump Organization since Trump resumed office.",
      "In his first term, Trump faced lawsuits from Maryland and the District of Columbia, as well as high-end restaurants and hotels in New York and Washington, D.C., that accused him of illegally profiting off the presidency through his luxury Washington hotel.",
      "In 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court brought an end to the cases, ruling them as moot since Trump was no longer president. The justices threw out Trump\u2019s challenge to lower court rulings that had allowed lawsuits to go forward alleging that he violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stay at the Trump International Hotel and patronize other businesses owned by the former president and his family.",
      "They've tried.",
      "Last year, congressional Democrats introduced legislation that would prohibit U.S. officials from accepting money, payments or gifts from foreign governments without congressional consent. It was their response to a yearslong probe into Trump's overseas business dealings.",
      "The proposals led by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Sen. Richard Blumenthal would enforce the Constitution\u2019s ban on emoluments, which prohibits the president from accepting foreign gifts and money without Congress\u2019 permission. Democrats have argued that Trump ignored the clause as president.",

      "Georgia has become the second state to provide a legal protections to the manufacturer of a popular weed killer",
      "In a victory for global agrochemical maker Bayer, Georgia has become the second state to shield pesticide manufacturers from some lawsuits claiming that they failed to warn customers of potential dangers.",
      "The legislation signed Friday by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is designed to protect Bayer from lawsuits claiming that it failed to tell customers that its popular weed killer Roundup could cause cancer. It's written broadly enough to provide legal protection in Georgia to any pesticide manufacturer that follows federal labeling requirements.",
      "North Dakota's governor signed the first such law last month, and similar measures have been considered this year in at least nine other states.",
      "Bayer, based in Germany, acquired Roundup with the 2018 purchase of St. Louis-based Monsanto. But it quickly was hit with an onslaught of lawsuits alleging that Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma. More than 67,000 of a total 181,000 claims involving Roundup remain outstanding, but a Bayer spokesperson said Monday that he didn't have specifics about how many of those are in Georgia.",
      "Though some studies associate glyphosate with cancer, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed.",
      "Bayer insists glyphosate is safe. But it has stopped using the ingredient in its residential version of Roundup and has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. It continues to use glyphosate in its agricultural version of Roundup but has warned that it might have to stop doing so if the legal costs keep mounting.",
      "The new Georgia law is to take effect Jan. 1. That means it won't effect existing cases, such as a March decision by a Georgia jury to award nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who alleged Roundup caused his cancer.",
      "Bayer has teamed up with a coalition of agricultural industry groups to mount a multiprong campaign. In addition to pursuing legislation in states and Congress, it also has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and has run ads on billboards, newspapers, TV and radio stations and internet sites touting the importance of glyphosate in agriculture.",
      "Glyphosate has for decades been used an efficient way to control weeds with less tilling, which helps prevent soil erosion. For some crops, such as corn, soybeans and cotton, Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist glyphosate\u2019s deadly effect.",
      "Without glyphosate, weeds could become harder to control, crop yields could decline and groceries could become more costly, Bayer said.",
      "The new law \u201cdemonstrates that Georgia stands with its farmers, who work tirelessly to produce safe and affordable food,\u201d said Brian Naber, president of Bayer's crop sciences in North America, Australia and New Zealand.",

      "Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds made a surprise announcement last month that she would not seek a third term, leaving a wide open Republican primary and offering Democrats a glimmer of hope that they could make inroads in a midterm year with President Donald Trump in the White House.",
      "\u201cIn Iowa, we know it\u2019s not about right versus left, but right versus wrong,\" Sand said in his announcement. \u201cAs governor, I will always do what\u2019s right for Iowans.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an uphill battle in a state that Trump won by 13 percentage points in 2024 and Reynolds by 18 percentage points in 2022. The state has shifted dramatically in favor of Republicans since 2006, the last time there was a governor\u2019s race without an incumbent candidate.",
      "Sand was first elected state auditor in 2018 by a margin of about 4 percentage points over his Republican opponent. But his election was far more competitive in 2022, when he won by less than 3,000 votes, or about three-tenths of a percentage.",
      "Recent voter registration data show nearly 200,000 more active voters registered as Republicans than Democrats.",

      "Gov. Gavin Newsom is urging California\u2019s local governments to begin clearing homeless encampments, escalating the state\u2019s efforts to ban makeshift camps that line streets up and down the state",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday urged California cities to clear homeless encampments, escalating once again his efforts to address an intractable issue of his time in office: the makeshift tents that line underpasses, parks and local streets up and down the state.",
      "Newsom's administration drafted a local law that counties, cities and towns can directly adopt or modify to achieve the Democratic governor's goals. He's also releasing $3.3 billion in voter-approved funds to expand housing and treatment options for homeless residents.",
      "\u201cThe time for inaction is over. There are no more excuses,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, made tackling homelessness a priority of his administration when he took office in 2019 and since then, Democratic leaders in the state have also moved toward cracking down on encampments. The state accounts for a quarter of the homeless population in the United States, with more than 187,000 Californians in need of housing.",
      "With tents lining streets and disrupting businesses in cities and towns across the state, homelessness has become one of the most pressing public health and safety issues in California and one sure to dog Newsom if he runs for national office.",
      "His declaration comes a year after the U.S. Supreme Court made it easier for officials to ban homeless people from camping outside. It was a ruling welcomed by many Democratic leaders, including Newsom, despite pushback from advocates for homeless people who objected to the decision by the conservative court as cruel.",
      "The key provisions of the model ordinance announced Monday include prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location, a ban on encampments that block sidewalks and a requirement that local officials provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter prior to clearing an encampment.",
      "Providing a ready-made local law could bring uniformity to how cities and counties deal with encampments though Newsom is urging local officials to modify his proposal as needed.",
      "Major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco have already started clearing out encampments, saying they are not fair to children, seniors and disabled people who need access to parks and sidewalks.",
      "San Francisco's new mayor, Daniel Lurie, pledged to clean up city sidewalks while in San Jos\u00e9, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times. Both cities have ramped up the number of shelter beds available so more people have somewhere to go.",
      "In Los Angeles, first-term Democratic Mayor Karen Bass has made clearing encampments a priority but sagging tents, makeshift shelters and rusting RVs remain an all-too-common sight in just about every neighborhood. An annual tally last year estimated that more than 45,000 homeless people were living in the city.",
      "Efforts to reduce homelessness are facing increased stress, as the city contends with a nearly $1 billion projected budget gap along with the massive and costly job of rebuilding the Pacific Palisades neighborhood that was destroyed in a January wildfire.",
      "A message was sent Monday to Bass\u2019 office seeking comment on Newsom\u2019s announcement.",
      "Critics say there is no evidence that punitive policies reduce homelessness and camping bans make it harder to link people up with stable housing and employment. People may lose critical documents or contact with a case manager, forcing them to start all over again, says the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "In 2024, California voters approved a measure that imposes strict requirements on counties to spend on housing and drug treatment programs to tackle the homelessness crisis. It was a signature proposal for Newsom, who campaigned for the measure\u2019s passage.",
      "Under the measure, counties are required to spend about two-thirds of the money from a voter-approved tax enacted in 2004 on millionaires for mental health services on housing and programs for homeless people with serious mental illnesses or substance abuse problems.",
      "The governor has also pushed for laws that make it easier to force people with behavioral health issues into treatment. And he has repeatedly threatened to withhold state money from cities and counties that do not step up to address homelessness.",
      "But despite the roughly billions of dollars spent on more than 30 homeless and housing programs during the 2018-2023 fiscal years, California does not have reliable data needed to fully understand why the problem didn\u2019t improve in many cities, according to a 2024 state audit.",

      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to do the right thing,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Democratic Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego is wading into one of Washington\u2019s most contentious and intractable political problems",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego is wading into one of Washington's most contentious and intractable political problems as he puts forward a plan Monday aimed at reforming the country's immigration system and beefing up border security.",
      "The plan by Gallego, who beat Republican Kari Lake in last fall's tight Senate race, calls for hiring more Border Patrol agents; using technology to stop fentanyl smuggling; reforming the asylum system; adding more ways for people to come to the U.S.; and a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants.",
      "Gallego's plan comes three months into President Donald Trump's administration as Trump seeks to deliver on campaign promises of carrying out mass deportations. His plan \u2014 or any other from Democrats \u2014 is unlikely to get much traction with Trump in the White House, but it illustrates that the debate about legislative solutions carries on.",
      "Many members of Congress have tried and failed to change the immigration system. A small group of senators, led by Gallego's predecessor, Krysten Sinema, negotiated for months in 2023 and 2024 over a border bill that would have toughened asylum protocols for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border; hired more officers to evaluate asylum claims and Border Patrol agents; and given money to local governments seeing influxes of migrants.",
      "That effort ran into a wall of opposition just hours after the bill was released.",
      "The last time Congress even came close to a breakthrough on immigration reform was in 2013, when a bipartisan group of senators pushed forward legislation creating a pathway to citizenship for millions of people in the country illegally and expanding work visas while tightening border security and mandating that employers verify workers\u2019 legal status. The Senate approved that proposal, but it was rejected by the House.",
      "Gallego's plan includes some elements that likely will find bipartisan support, such as his calls to beef up border security. But other parts \u2014 like efforts to legalize anyone already in the country illegally \u2014 will prove much more contentious.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to choose between border security and immigration reform. We can and should do both,\" Gallego said in a news release Monday. He said \u201cfor decades, Congress has tried and failed to take action because politics got in the way. It\u2019s time to push forward and enact a plan that works.\u201d",
      "Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, replaced Sinema, a Democrat-turned Independent from Arizona who often was on the forefront on immigration and border security legislation.",
      "Here's a look at the 21-page plan:",
      "Gallego argues that tougher immigration enforcement alone isn\u2019t the answer and that it should be paired with more ways for people to come to the U.S. legally.",
      "The plan calls for increasing the annual allotment of some visas and Green Cards and removing or significantly increasing \u201carbitrary per-country caps.\u201d He also wants to create new visa categories, boost refugee resettlement and expedite the naturalization process for immigrants who serve in the military.",
      "He also calls for gradually implementing E-Verify, which makes it easy to check if potential employees can legally work in the U.S. E-Verify has often faced resistance over concerns it would lead to widespread labor shortages.",
      "Arguing on moral and economic grounds, Gallego calls for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "There\u2019s no exact number of how many people this would encompass, although some estimates put the number as high as 3.4 million people.",
      "Gallego\u2019s plan also calls for a pathway to citizenship for spouses of U.S. citizens who are in the country illegally. President Joe Biden tried something similar last year in a program that would have covered an estimated 550,000 people, but it was swiftly held up by a judge.",
      "Noting that migrant border arrivals started dropping back in June of last year, Gallego warns that a surge can come at any time so investments should be made now. The senator calls for better pay and addressing issues like workforce safety to help hire and retain Border Patrol agents; investments in technology and infrastructure to detect drugs or human smuggling; and focusing efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on removing people who pose a safety threat.",
      "Gallego, who often speaks about the toll of migrant surges on Arizona's border towns, also is proposing money to help affected communities.",
      "Instead of having asylum cases decided in backlogged immigration courts, Gallego wants to hire more asylum officers and give them the power to decide those cases. He also is proposing making the asylum standard higher and cutting back on asylum access during border surges.",
      "Gallego argues the U.S. needs to figure out why migrants are leaving their home countries in the first place and address those problems.",

      "It has been more than a year and a half since authorities in Georgia indicted 61 activists on racketeering charges in connection with protests against an Atlanta-area police training facility that critics derisively call \u201cCop City.\u201d",
      "ATLANTA -- Single mother Priscilla Grim lost her job. Aspiring writer Julia Dupuis frequently stares at the bedroom ceiling, numb. Geography and environmental studies researcher Hannah Kass is worried about her career prospects after she graduates from her Ph.D. program.",
      "The three are among 61 defendants accused by Republican Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr of participating in a yearslong racketeering conspiracy to halt the construction of a police and firefighter training facility just outside Atlanta that critics pejoratively call \u201cCop City.\u201d",
      "Their cases are at a standstill, 20 months after being indicted under Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, which is likely the largest criminal racketeering case ever filed against protesters in U.S. history, experts say.",
      "Trial for five of the defendants was supposed to start last year but got bogged down in procedural issues. The judge overseeing the case then moved to another court. A new judge has set a status hearing for Wednesday.",
      "The delays have left people in limbo, facing charges carrying up to 20 years behind bars for what they maintain was legitimate protest, not domestic terrorism. The case also has suppressed a movement that brought together hundreds of activists to protect a wooded patch of land that ultimately was razed for the recently completed $118 million, 85-acre (34-hectare) project.",
      "Officials say the project is sorely needed to replace outdated facilities and boost officers' morale. Opponents say it will be a training ground for a militarized police force and its construction has worsened environmental damage in a poor, majority-Black area.",
      "Protests escalated after the fatal 2023 shooting of Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n, known as Tortuguita, who was camping near the site when authorities launched a clearing operation. Officials said they killed Tortuguita, 26, after the activist shot and wounded a trooper from inside a tent.",
      "A family-commissioned autopsy concluded Tortuguita was killed with their hands in the air, but a prosecutor found the officers' use of force was \u201c objectively reasonable.\u201d",
      "Chris Timmons, a former Georgia prosecutor who has handled numerous RICO cases, said it\u2019s understandable such a large case would take a long time to be scheduled. But Timmons said he is surprised prosecutors don\u2019t seem to be aggressively pushing for a trial date.",
      "\u201cCases age like milk, not like wine,\u201d Timmons said. \u201cThe longer we go, memories fade, witnesses become unavailable. If I were in the prosecutors' shoes, I\u2019d want this case tried as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Michael Mears, a professor at Atlanta\u2019s John Marshall Law School who studies RICO cases, said prosecutors \u201cboxed themselves in by charging so many people at one time instead of going after the leadership.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors\u2019 decision last year to drop money laundering charges against three of the movement\u2019s alleged leaders was a sign of the case\u2019s weakness. And with the movement having faded from the public consciousness, there is less political appetite for cracking down on the protesters, he said.",
      "\u201cProsecutors can\u2019t just walk away from it, but I think you\u2019ll probably see it die a slow death,\u201d Mears said, predicting charges would slowly be dismissed.",
      "That is cold comfort for those who say their lives are on hold.",
      "\u201cI think most of our lives are just completely frozen in one way or another,\u201d said Dupuis, 26, who lives in Massachusetts.",
      "Dupuis was charged with felony intimidation of an officer in 2023 for distributing anti-police flyers near the home of one of the troopers who killed Tortuguita, Dupuis\u2019 friend. The trooper called authorities after learning the flyers, which called him a \u201cmurderer,\u201d were placed on his neighbors' mailboxes.",
      "Now banned from Georgia, Dupuis struggles to find the motivation to complete freelance copywriting projects that pay for their $650 rent.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot I want to do, a lot of hopes and dreams that I feel like are just kind of stuck,\u201d said Dupuis, who dreams of joining New York City\u2019s creative writing scene.",
      "But most of all, Dupuis misses the activist community that once thrived in the South River Forest.",
      "\u201cThe charges have ripped me away from my community and the people that I love so much. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been longing for every single day: to be back with my people,\" Dupuis said.",
      "Grim, 51, is tired of waiting and recently filed for a speedy trial. It's unclear whether her motion will be granted, since the speedy trial deadline passed long ago.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\" Grim said. \"If you think you have something on me, let\u2019s do it \u2014 which you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Grim, who lives in New York City, is one of many \u201cStop Cop City\u201d defendants who post on social media for financial support to help pay for food and rent. Health insurance is out of the question, despite chronic pain in her knee from a prior accident.",
      "Besides the couple hundred dollars she gets each month from donors she doesn't know, Grim cobbles together funds through freelance work for activist-oriented causes and is focused on helping her daughter get through college.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had such a hard time finding employment,\u201d said Grim, who previously held marketing jobs. \u201cI do really well until the final interview and then everybody goes ghost on me. I think it's because that's when they look my name up.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say Grim was among a throng of black-clad activists in March 2023 who left a music festival, walked through the woods and overtook the construction site, torching equipment and throwing rocks at retreating officers before returning to blend in with festivalgoers.",
      "Grim said she was in her tent, having woken up from a nap, when officers arrived at the festival and began making arrests. Grim said she began to run before falling due to her knee injury.",
      "\u201cI heard men screaming at me,\" Grim said, describing what prompted her to run. \"That's scary as a woman. They didn't say they were police or anything.\u201d",
      "Authorities, however, said Grim ran upon spotting the officers and tried to hide.",
      "After her arrest, Grim lost an email marketing contract with Fordham University, which had been about to give her a full-time position.",
      "\u201cPeople know me, and when they hear I'm a \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019 they\u2019re like, \u2018What? No! What?!\u2019 Grim said. \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about activist friends saying this \u2014 these are friends from parent circles.\u201d",
      "On May 12, 2022, a group of protesters gathered in suburban Atlanta outside the offices of Brasfield & Gorrie, the training center's primary contractor. Some set off fireworks as others broke windows and spray-painted \u201cTrees not cops,\u201d causing an estimated $30,000 in damage, authorities said.",
      "Kass, 32, attended the protest but said she never vandalized anything and was engaging in a research method called \u201cparticipant observation,\u201d which involves immersing oneself in the community being studied.",
      "\u201cI was there as both a scholar and an activist,\u201d said Kass, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies land struggles and teaches environmental social sciences to undergraduates.",
      "Authorities arrested her on charges of felony criminal property damage and felony terroristic threats, saying surveillance video shows she helped set off Roman candles.",
      "Kass underwent a university disciplinary hearing but said the school has supported her. She worries potential employers might not be as understanding.",
      "Like many of her codefendants, Kass rejected prosecutors' plea deal at her RICO arraignment that would have included serving three years in prison.",
      "\u201cI have absolutely nothing to plead guilty for,\" she said. \"I should have every right to protest and believe what I want to believe and associate with whatever political tendencies I wish to associate with.\u201d",

      "He applied only to U.S. schools and was accepted by some. But after the initial excitement, he began seeing reasons for doubt.",
      "First, there was President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Then, China's Ministry of Education issued a warning about studying in America. When he saw the wave of legal status terminations for international students in the U.S., he realized he needed to consider how American politics could affect him.",
      "The recent developments soured some of his classmates on studying in the U.S., but he plans to come anyway. He is ready \u201cto adapt to whatever changes may come,\" he said.",
      "American universities, home to many programs at the top of their fields, have long appealed to students around the world hoping to pursue research and get a foothold in the U.S. job market. The durability of that demand faces a test under the Trump administration, which has taken actions that have left international students feeling vulnerable and considering alternate places to study.",
      "\u201cAll of the Trump administration's activities have been sending a message that international students are not welcome in the U.S.,\u201d said Clay Harmon, executive director of AIRC, a professional association for international enrollment managers at colleges.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the U.S. last year. A large decline in their ranks could cripple school budgets that rely on tuition from foreign students, who are ineligible for federal student aid and often pay full price to attend.",
      "It's too early to quantify any impact from the administration's crackdown, which has included new scrutiny of student visas and efforts to deport foreign students for involvement in pro-Palestinian activism. But many fear the worst.",
      "\u201cStudents and their families expect and need certainty,\u201d said Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. \u201cAnd they do not function well in a volatile environment like the one we have currently.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has been rebounding from a decline in international enrollment that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As top competitors such as Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom rolled back recruiting efforts and made immigration policies less welcoming, the U.S. appeared ready to bring in far more students.",
      "Now, a few months into the Trump administration, industry experts say it's unlikely the U.S. will be able to capitalize.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. was so perfectly positioned to become the far and away, clear first-choice destination for international students,\u201d said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services. His company works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe to recruit international students. \"Then it just went out the door.\"",
      "In Canada, where colleges saw enrollment increases during the first Trump administration, they are hoping for another bounce. In a letter following the recent election, a member organization for Canadian universities urged the new Liberal government to address immigration policies that have affected recruitment of foreign students.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of real opportunity for the country to attract international talent,\u201d said Gabriel Miller, president of Universities Canada.",
      "The U.S. holds strong appeal for students prioritizing career outcomes, in part because of the \u201coptional practical training\u201d program, which allows foreign students to stay on their student visas and work for up to three years, said Lindsey L\u00f3pez of ApplyBoard, an application platform for students seeking to study abroad.",
      "Graduates earning this post-college work experience were among the foreigners whose legal status or visas were terminated this spring.",
      "Still, the diversity and size of the U.S. job market could help American schools stay ahead of the competition, L\u00f3pez said.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is the largest economy in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the vastness and also the economic diversity that we have in the U.S., with a whole variety of different industries, both public and private, for students to choose from.\u201d",
      "William Paterson University, a public institution of 10,000 students in New Jersey, typically has around 250 international students. It expects an increase in foreign students in the fall, according to George Kacenga, vice president for enrollment management. The school has focused on designing programs around STEM majors, which appeal to international students because they open access to OPT programs.",
      "Students have expressed concern about securing visas, but most of the school\u2019s international students are from India and report they are getting appointments, he said.",
      "In Shanghai, many students in Austin Ward\u2019s 12th grade class have either committed to attending U.S. colleges or are considering it. Ward teaches literature in a high school program offering an American Common Core curriculum for Chinese students.",
      "Ward said he avoids discussing politics with his students, but some have asked him about the U.S. government's termination of students' legal statuses, signaling their concern about going to the U.S.",

      "One thing Albert and his wife, Estera, a Jewish survivor of the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, loved best in his first post for USAID, in Ivory Coast, was driving deep into the countryside to where Albert and USAID were working to expand rural housing. He had a big white station wagon that Ivorians came to recognize. They nicknamed it the Bateau - the Boat.",
      "A treasured family photo captures one of those moments. Albert and Ivorian elders are deep in animated discussion, surrounded by community members craning to hear every word. Estera watches, smiling.",
      "Ivory Coast\u2019s leaders gave Albert one of their country\u2019s highest medals for his work. When he was killed decades later, Ivorian officials traveled across the Atlantic for his memorial.",
      "Back then, \u201cyou feel like you were recognized as a country for trying to do the right thing and trying to help, and in fact, contributing lives and resources to help people overseas,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful thing to have seen. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever see it again.\"",
      "After the 1983 bombing, President Ronald Reagan eulogized Albert and the 16 other Americans killed. The Reagan administration had directed USAID workers to Lebanon just before the attack, hoping their work to restore a more normal life for civilians there could help lead the country out of civil war.",
      "Days after the bombing, Reagan spoke in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base over newly returned bodies.",
      "\u201cThe best way for us to show our love and respect for our fellow countrymen who died in Beirut this week is to carry on with their task,\" Reagan said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\"",
      "Over the years, the names of 98 USAID and other foreign assistance colleagues were placed on a memorial wall inside USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "One of those names was Albert Votaw.",
      "After her father died, Cathy Votaw switched from private legal practice to working as a federal prosecutor. It paid tribute, she felt, to his government service. She also became an advocate for better treatment for federal workers and other American victims of extremist attacks and their families.",
      "The embassy suicide bombing that killed her father was one of the first of its kind, though it was overshadowed by another that hit a U.S. Marines barracks and killed 241 service members that October.",
      "The Votaws and others lobbied the State Department to beef up efforts to work with families in future attacks. It worked: They won a victory in federal court designating Iran responsible as a sponsor of militants involved.",
      "And in the biggest achievement of all, survivors of attacks and relatives of victims, including Cathy, successfully pushed Congress to set up a fund for them and future victims, using billions of dollars in fines paid by entities that did business with countries the U.S. deems state sponsors of terror. That helped spur compensation for victims and family members in attacks on the U.S. since, including 9/11.",
      "Somehow, Albert\u2019s death in the Beirut bombing gave one of his granddaughters, Anna Eisenberg, a deep sense that because the worst had already happened to her family, it wouldn\u2019t happen to her.",
      "After growing up hearing of her grandfather's life and death in public service, she started work as a contractor for USAID almost as soon as she got out of college.",
      "Teaching communication skills to communities in war zones and telling the story of USAID, her assignments took her through Boko Haram territory in Nigeria, where she profiled Nigerian teachers as they schooled young children orphaned in attacks. And she worked in Afghanistan, coaching female government communication workers to speak up loudly enough to be heard.",
      "In northern Nigeria, \u2018\u2019they were like, \u2018Are you sure you want to do this? ... You're not in an armored car. You don't have any weapons,''' Anna, now 37, recounted of her trips through militants' territory. \u201cI just felt like I was able to go places ... because nothing bad would happen: 'Yeah, my grandfather got blown up \u2014 we're good.\"'",
      "In some ways, Anna was looking forward to Trump's second term for her agency. She believed that Trump, in his first term, had done a better job than most presidents at promoting how USAID built jobs at home. He'd do that again in his second term, she figured, increasing public support for an agency few Americans cared about.",
      "As it turned out, her job ended when USAID's life as a functioning independent agency did \u2014 in form-letter terminations.",
      "Albert had been jittery about his assignment to Beirut in a way he'd never been before. Still, he reassured his family, the U.S. government knew what it was doing.",
      "Just before he left, Cathy recalls, Albert's mother asked him if he would be OK.",
      "\u201c'Mother,\u201d he assured her, \u201cthey would not send me anywhere that was not safe.\u201d",
      "Eleven days after Albert arrived, the truck bomb exploded at the front of the U.S. embassy there. Many of those killed, including Albert, were in the embassy cafeteria. His family likes to think he was in his element, chatty and at a table holding forth on some story, when the bomb exploded.",
      "This year\u2019s anniversary of his death was nothing like the ones before. This year, USAID itself sat in ruins.",
      "Trump and Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency crews are slashing staffing and programs across federal government, made USAID an early target. They said most American foreign assistance was a waste and advanced liberal agendas. They shut USAID headquarters, terminated the majority of its development and humanitarian programs abroad and fired most staff and contractors.",
      "A Feb. 3 post by Musk on social media became a death notice for USAID itself: \u201cSpent the weekend feeding USAID into a woodchipper.\"",
      "A few weeks ago, at the now-closed and barricaded USAID headquarters in Washington, a crew pried off the memorial to those who died in Beirut, including the name of a gregarious public-housing expert who had a handlebar mustache and lived for, and died for, his work.",
      "The State Department said it would find a permanent home for the memorial.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A group of 49 white South Africans departed their homeland Sunday for the United States on a private charter plane having been offered refugee status by the Trump administration under a new program announced in February.",
      "The group, which included families and small children, was due to arrive at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Monday morning local time, according to Collen Msibi, a spokesperson for South Africa's transport ministry.",
      "They are the first Afrikaners \u2014 a white minority group in South Africa \u2014 to be relocated after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 7 accusing South Africa's Black-led government of racial discrimination against them and announcing a program to offer them relocation to America.",
      "The South African government said it is \u201ccompletely false\u201d that Afrikaners are being persecuted.",
      "The Trump administration has fast-tracked their applications while pausing other refugee programs, halting arrivals from Afghanistan, Iraq, most of sub-Saharan Africa and other countries in a move being challenged in court.",
      "Refugee groups have questioned why the white South Africans are being prioritized ahead of people from countries wracked by war and natural disasters. Vetting for refugee status in the U.S. often takes years.",
      "The Trump administration says the South African government is pursuing racist, anti-white policies through affirmative action laws and a new land expropriation law it says targets Afrikaners' land. The government says those claims are based on misinformation and there is no racism against Afrikaners and no land has been expropriated, although the contentious law has been passed and is the focus of criticism in South Africa.",
      "South Africa also denies U.S. claims that Afrikaners are being targeted in racially motivated attacks in some rural communities. Instead, the South African government said Afrikaners \u2014 who are the descendants of Dutch and French colonial settlers \u2014 are \"amongst the most economically privileged\" in the country.",
      "The first Afrikaner refugees were traveling on a flight operated by the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based charter company Omni Air International, Msibi said. They would fly to Dakar, Senegal and stop there to refuel before heading for Dulles.",
      "They departed from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, where they were accompanied by police officers and airport officials when they checked in. Msibi said they would have to be vetted by police to ensure there were no criminal cases or outstanding warrants against them before being allowed to leave.",
      "The South African government said there was no justification for them being relocated but said it wouldn't stop them and respected their freedom of choice.",
      "They are expected to be greeted at Dulles by a U.S. government delegation, including the deputy secretary of state and officials from the Department of Health and Human Services, whose refugee office has organized their resettlement.",
      "The flight will be the first in a \u201cmuch larger-scale relocation effort,\u201d White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told reporters on Friday. Miller said that what was happening to Afrikaners in South Africa \"fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is persecution based on a protected characteristic \u2014 in this case, race. This is race-based persecution,\u201d he said.",
      "The HHS Office for Refugee Resettlement was ready to offer them support, including with housing, furniture and other household items, and expenses like groceries, clothing, diapers and more, a document obtained by The Associated Press said. The document said the relocation of Afrikaners was \"a stated priority of the Administration.\u201d",
      "There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners among South Africa\u2019s population of 62 million, which is more than 80% Black. They are only one part of the country's white minority.",
      "Many in South Africa are puzzled by claims that Afrikaners are persecuted and meet the requirements to be relocated as refugees.",
      "They are part of South Africa\u2019s everyday multi-racial life, with many successful business leaders and some serving in government as Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers. Their language is widely spoken and recognized as an official language, and churches and other institutions reflecting Afrikaner culture hold prominence in almost every city and town.",
      "The Trump administration has criticized South Africa on several fronts. Trump's February executive order cut all U.S. funding to South Africa over what it said was its anti-white stance and also accused it of pursuing an anti-American foreign policy. It cited South Africa's ties with Iran and its move to lodge a genocide case against U.S. ally Israel over the war in Gaza as examples of it taking \"aggressive positions towards the United States.\"",

      "Government officials are jumping on planes to try and convince international companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to the island, where they would be exempt from tariffs.",
      "Any relocation would be a boost to Puerto Rico\u2019s shaky economy as the government emerges from a historic bankruptcy and continues to struggle with chronic power outages. The island also is bracing for potentially big cuts in federal funding under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, with federal funds currently representing more than half of Puerto Rico\u2019s budget.",
      "\u201cThe tariff issue is a controversial one, but for Puerto Rico, it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d said Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "Manufacturing remains the island\u2019s biggest industry, representing nearly half of its gross domestic product. But the government wants to recapture Puerto Rico\u2019s heyday, when dozens of big-name companies, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, were based here and kept the economy humming.",
      "So far, officials have identified between 75 to 100 companies that might consider relocating operations to Puerto Rico given the ongoing trade war, said Ella Woger Nieves, CEO of Invest Puerto Rico, a public-private partnership that promotes the island as a business and investment destination.",
      "The companies identified work in sectors including aerospace, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.",
      "Officials also have welcomed site selectors to Puerto Rico and organized tours to show them the island\u2019s available infrastructure and stress how tariffs wouldn\u2019t apply here.",
      "\u201cThis is the moment to plant those seeds,\u201d Woger Nieves said.",
      "She said officials with Invest Puerto Rico and various government agencies are expected to make almost 20 more trips this year in a bid to attract more manufacturing to the island. The government praised an executive order that Trump signed Monday that aims to reduce the time it takes to approve construction of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the U.S.",
      "In the mid-1900s, needlework was one of Puerto Rico\u2019s largest industries, employing about 7,000 workers who labored on handkerchiefs, underwear, bedspreads and other items, according to a 1934 fair competition code signed by President Theodore Roosevelt.",
      "Manufacturing later shifted to chemicals, clothes and electronics. By the late 1970s, a growing number of pharmaceutical companies began moving their operations to Puerto Rico, lured by a federal tax incentive created in 1976 to help boost the island\u2019s economic growth. However, in 1996, the U.S. government began phasing out the incentive, which exempted the subsidiaries of U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico from federal taxes on local profits.",
      "From 1995 to 2005, overall manufacturing employment fell by nearly 30%, but employment in the sectors of pharmaceuticals, medicines and chemicals increased by at least 10%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Puerto Rico continues to lead U.S. exports of pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, representing nearly 20% of total U.S. exports in 2020, according to the bureau.",
      "In 2024, the island exported nearly $25 billion worth of goods, including $11 billion worth of vaccines and certain cultures; $7 billion worth of packaged medicaments; $1 billion worth of hormones; $984 million worth of orthopedic items; and $625 million worth of medical instruments, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.",
      "Sergio Marxuach, policy director and general counsel for the Center for a New Economy, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank, said the push to attract more companies makes sense, especially recruiting those in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors.",
      "\u201cIf I were advising the government, begin there because you already have a footprint,\u201d he said.",
      "Marxuach noted that outside of those areas, Puerto Rico could have an advantage when it comes to national defense and security contracts, including the manufacturing of drones or underwater surveillance systems.",
      "\u201cThey need a place to manufacture in scale,\u201d he said, adding that doing so in a U.S. jurisdiction is key.",
      "Puerto Rico\u2019s government also is meeting with university officials to potentially change curriculums if needed to ensure students are graduating with the skills required by companies.",
      "Puerto Rico touts its U.S. jurisdiction, tax incentives and skilled workforce as reasons international companies should relocate to the island.",
      "But it cannot escape its well-known energy problems.",
      "Chronic power outages continue to plague Puerto Rico, with two island-wide blackouts occurring on Dec. 31 and April 16.",
      "Crews are still repairing the power grid after it was razed by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already fragile following a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico needs more reliable energy for the economic growth to improve,\u201d said Robert F. Mujica, executive director of a federal control board that oversees the island\u2019s finances.",

      "\u201cPower doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be an impediment,\u201d she said.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of the Newark Liberty International Airport for the \u201cnext several weeks.\u201d",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says he plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of Newark's airport for the \u201cnext several weeks\u201d as it struggles with radar outages and other issues, including another Sunday that again slowed air traffic.",
      "Speaking on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Duffy said he will meet this week with all major carriers flying through Newark Liberty International, New Jersey\u2019s largest airport. He said the number of flight cutbacks would fluctuate by time of day with most targeting afternoon hours when international arrivals make the airport busier.",
      "In addition to equipment outages, the airport has been been beset by flight delays and cancellations brought on by a shortage of air traffic controllers.",
      "\u201cWe want to have a number of flights that if you book your flight, you know it\u2019s going to fly, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the priority. So you don\u2019t get to the airport, wait four hours, and then get delayed.\u201d",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration reported a \u201ctelecommunications issue\u201d as the latest setback Sunday, impacting a facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport. An FAA statement said the agency briefly slowed air traffic to and from the airport while ensuring \u201credundancies were working as designed\u201d before normal operations resumed.",
      "Infrastructure issues are increasingly a key concern at airports around the country.",
      "In an unrelated incident, hundreds of flights were delayed Sunday at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport \u2014 one of the world\u2019s busiest \u2014 because of a runway equipment issue. The FAA said in a statement that it temporarily slowed arrivals into Atlanta while technicians worked to address the problem.",
      "In Newark, Sunday's disruptions came two days after radar at the Philadelphia facility went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday, an episode that was similar to an incident on April 28.",
      "The Trump administration recently proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the U.S. air traffic control system, envisioning six new air traffic control centers and technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation\u2019s air traffic facilities over the next three or four years.",
      "The FAA said last week that it slows the rate of arrivals into Newark to ensure safety whenever staffing or equipment issues arise. The agency also noted that frequent equipment and telecommunications outages can be stressful, prompting some air traffic controllers to take time off \"to recover from the stress.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot quickly replace them due to this highly specialized profession, we continue to train controllers who will eventually be assigned to this busy airspace,\u201d the FAA said in a May 5 statement.",
      "On average, there had been 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid-April at Newark, according to the FAA, with the number of delays increasing throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. The delays tended to last 85 to 137 minutes on average.",
      "Duffy said in his TV appearance Sunday that he wants to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61, as he tries to navigate a shortage of about 3,000 people in that specialized position.",
      "And he also spoke of wanting to give those air traffic controllers a 20% upfront bonus to stay on the job. However, he says many air traffic controllers choose to retire after 25 years of service, which means many retire around the age of 50.",
      "\u201cThese are not overnight fixes,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cBut as we go up \u2014 one, two years, older guys on the job, younger guys coming in, men and women \u2014 we can make up that 3,000-person difference.\u201d",
      "Adding more air traffic controllers is in contrast to a top priority of the Trump administration \u2014 slashing jobs in nearly all other federal agencies.",
      "However, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Duffy deserves credit for putting \u201ccaution tape\u201d around FAA safety functions and separating those personnel from cost-cutting by Trump's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE.",
      "Kirby said United has already reduced its schedule at Newark and will meet with Duffy later this week. He expects a deeper cut in capacity to last until June 15 when construction work on one of Newark's runways is expected to be complete, though he thinks some reductions will last throughout the summer.",
      "\u201cWe have fewer flights, but we keep everything safe, and we get the airplane safely on the ground,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cSafety is number one, and so I\u2019m not worried about safety. I am worried about customer delays and impacts.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An abortion clinic in Colorado that for more than 50 years served people who looked to terminate their pregnancies in the second or third trimester quietly closed last month",
      "To fellow travelers, Hannah Brehm likely looked like she was taking a belated babymoon well into her third trimester.",
      "But she and her husband had received a crushing diagnosis: Their baby's brain was not developing properly, upending their wanted pregnancy. Medical experts warned moving forward would likely mean her son would know only pain and suffering. The Minnesota couple wasn't going to take that chance.",
      "Instead, they went to Colorado, where for decades the Boulder Abortion Clinic served as a resource for women who looked to terminate their pregnancies in the second or third trimester because of medical reasons, like Brehm, or other circumstances.",
      "After more than 50 years, that clinic quietly closed last month, leaving the U.S. with just a handful that offer abortions after 28 weeks into pregnancy \u2014 many on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The 87-year-old clinic founder, Dr. Warren Hern, says he is deeply upset: \u201cIt became impossible to continue, but closing is one of the most painful decisions of my life.\u201d",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have celebrated the closure, calling it a step forward in protecting mothers and unborn children. While the overwhelming majority of abortions take place in the first trimester, former patients and reproductive rights advocates worry about the impact of losing an already narrow resource.",
      "\u201cChances are it\u2019s not gonna happen to you. And I hope it doesn\u2019t happen to someone else that you love, but it is happening,\u201d Brehm said, reflecting on her experience in 2022.",
      "Federal data shows just 1% of abortions come after 21 weeks of pregnancy, but experts believe that number is higher because some states, including California, don't give the feds their abortion statistics.",
      "The reasons for late abortions vary. Some diagnoses like anatomy abnormalities or genetic disorders can't happen until after 20 weeks or later into pregnancy. Other women may not find out they're pregnant until after the first trimester. Millions of women live in a state with a strict abortion ban.",
      "Sarah Watkins traveled from Georgia to the Boulder clinic in 2019 just before 25 weeks into her pregnancy after learning her baby had a condition called trisomy 18, an extra chromosome that made it likely the baby would die in utero or shortly after birth. A genetic blood screening at 10 weeks previously dismissed chances of the condition, but a detailed ultrasound in the second trimester proved otherwise.",
      "\u201cYou can do everything right, by the book, but you still can\u2019t find out certain things until that ultrasound at 20 weeks and sometimes even later,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as a mom, I did not want her to feel a single moment of hurt or suffering or pain or discomfort. That\u2019s why I made the decision.\"",
      "Watkins described the medical care she received at the Hern's clinic attentive and caring. Nevertheless, she said traveling to a place with multiple layers of bulletproof glass and a throng of protesters was a traumatic experience.",
      "For years, Hern was the only provider in the U.S. to offer later abortions, starting in 1973 and developing specialized techniques and even innovating certain tools to ensure better health outcomes. But offering abortions late in pregnancy came with risks.",
      "He and his medical team received constant death threats. Someone shot through the windows of the clinic five times in 1988. Five of Hern's colleagues who offered similar services were assassinated throughout his career, including the 2009 slaying of Dr. George Tiller in Kansas.",
      "When Hern announced the clinic's closure in late April, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America declared the news as a \u201cVICTORY\u201d in a social media post.",
      "Hern said the work was always worth it. He recalled one of his first patients who couldn't believe cleanliness of his operating room; she previously had an illegal abortion that left her humiliated and frightened.",
      "\u201cShe looked up at me and said 'Please, don't ever stop doing this,'\" Hern said. \u201cSo I didn't. Until now.\u201d",
      "In the end, financial issues made it almost impossible to operate the clinic. Hern said patients increasingly were having trouble paying for the procedure, which hovers around $10,000 and is often not covered by insurance. Longtime personal donors were also dwindling.",
      "Hern worked with physicians over the decades, hopeful that one day they would take over his clinic, but that never worked out.",
      "\u201cI had to make a decision really, you know, sort of on the basis of the situation at the moment that we couldn\u2019t continue,\" he said. \"It was very, very painful. I see this as my personal failure.\u201d",
      "According to the Later Abortion Initiative by Ibis Reproductive Health, fewer than 20 clinics provide abortions after 24 weeks into pregnancy in the U.S. \u2014 though that number isn't considered comprehensive and excludes hospitals and a handful of other clinics for security reasons.",
      "Currently, the group lists three clinics \u2014 in New Mexico, Maryland and Washington, D.C. \u2014 that provide services after 28 weeks. Five others \u2014 in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington state \u2014 will consider patients depending on physician recommendations or fetal and maternal conditions.",
      "\u201cI think Dr. Hern has been the torchbearer for abortion leaders in pregnancy,\u201d said Jane Armstrong, a licensed therapist in Texas who now helps support families who have terminated pregnancies for medical reasons. She ended her own pregnancy around 21 weeks in 2021.",
      "\u201cWho will pick up the mantle? We really do need a new torchbearer right now.\u201d",
      "A dozen states have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks. Abortion fund organizations, which help people arrange and pay abortions, say the bans mean a higher demand for later abortions. When people travel, it often takes more time to make appointments, gather the money needed and to catch a flight or take a drive hundreds of miles away.",
      "\u201cEvery time a clinic closes, it does impact everybody and what kinds of care they give,\u201d said Anna Rupani, executive director of Fund Texas Choice.",
      "Shortly after the nation's highest court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, an all-trimester abortion clinic opened in Maryland \u2014 a partnership between certified nurse-midwife Morgan Nuzzo and Dr. Diane Horvath, an OB-GYN who specializes in complex family planning.",
      "They said they're worried about many things when it comes to reproductive rights, including the Trump administration\u2019s move to curtail prosecutions against people accused of blocking access to abortion clinics and reproductive health centers. But they're also buoyed by the consistent overwhelming number of applications from providers whenever they post a position, and said that the number of clinics that offer later abortions has gone up since Roe was overturned.",
      "\u201cThis type of care is still available,\" Horvath said. \u201cIt\u2019s more rare than it was a couple weeks ago, but we want to say loud and proud that our doors are still open and there are other places still open.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- News that the global Catholic church would get its first-ever U.S.-born pope was welcomed by Catholics across the ideological spectrum in Pope Leo XIV \u2019s homeland, raising the question of whether he might be able to ease some of the deep divisions within its ranks.",
      "From U.S. Catholics to the left of the ideological center, there is optimism that Leo will carry on Pope Francis\u2019 outreach to poor and marginalized people, including migrants, and provide a counterweight to policies of the Trump administration that distress them. To the right, there is hope the new pope will faithfully uphold Catholic doctrine, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and women\u2019s ordination.",
      "One reason for optimism: The new pope has made clear \u2014 in his remarks and his choice of a motto \u2014 that unity within the global church will be a paramount priority.",
      "\u201cIn these early days, he\u2019s still an empty vessel,\u201d said Steven Millies, a public theology professor at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. \u201cUntil we all get to know him better, we can pour our expectations into him.\u201d",
      "Notre Dame Provost John McGreevy, a historian of Catholicism, said he was \u201ccompletely stunned\u201d after the papal announcement, having shared the conventional wisdom that a pope from the U.S. was a near-impossibility.",
      "But Leo \u201cis a global Catholic citizen,\u201d McGreevy said, citing the pontiff\u2019s time in Peru, at the Vatican and leading an international religious order.",
      "\u201cEven though he\u2019s an American, and we\u2019re super proud that he\u2019s American, it\u2019s hard to think of someone more embedded in a lot of the global church,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s too soon to tell what Leo\u2019s relationship will be with his fellow American prelates and the broader U.S. Catholic Church, McGreevy cautioned.",
      "\u201cThe early indications are that there\u2019ll be some similarities to Pope Francis,\u201d he said \u2013 suggesting that differences with conservative U.S. bishops could continue.",
      "McGreevy said he expects some tension between the Vatican and the White House over immigration and climate change, two of Francis\u2019 key priorities that are likely to be reaffirmed by Leo.",
      "Chad Pecknold, a professor of systematic theology at the Catholic University of America, suggested that Francis either disliked or misunderstood the United States.",
      "\u201cWith Leo XIV, it\u2019s clear he not only loves America, but he even loves the White Sox,\u201d Pecknold said via email. \u201cThat can only have a good effect, not only upon American Catholics, but also American bishops, and indeed, everyone. It\u2019s good to feel like the pope is on your side.\u201d",
      "During the latter years of Francis\u2019 papacy, one of the most divisive issues among U.S. bishops was whether Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights \u2014 including then-President Joe Biden and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 should be barred from receiving Communion.",
      "Francis stressed he would not reject politicians who support abortion rights and Biden received Communion during a visit to Rome in 2021.",
      "San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, who barred Pelosi from receiving Communion in the archdiocese, described Leo as a \"bridge builder.\"",
      "\"He will be a good force for unity in the church,\u201d Cordileone told KPIX-TV in San Francisco. \u201cEven with differences of opinion and different ideas of strategy and so forth, we can have unity in the church.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and outspoken abortion opponent, took heart from a homily delivered early this year by Leo when he was Cardinal Robert Prevost. The passage cited by Smith: \u201cGod\u2019s mercy calls us to protect every life, especially those society overlooks \u2014 the child yet to be born and the elderly nearing their journey\u2019s end \u2014 because each bears Christ\u2019s face.\u201d",
      "Smith depicted this remark as \u201cunderscoring the protection of the right to life as first among the many humanitarian responsibilities of the Church.\u201d",
      "The interim president of Catholics for Choice, which supports abortion rights, acknowledged that Leo opposes abortion and said the group would send him letters from Catholics who disagree with that stance.",
      "\u201cWe are praying that he will be a pope guided by a commitment to peace, justice, and inclusion,\u201d said Chris Wimbush. \u201cThe future of our church depends on greater inclusion and nuance on reproductive health decisions like abortion, contraception and IVF.\"",
      "Francis, during his papacy, took major strides to give women more senior leadership positions in the church. But he upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons.",
      "Ellie Hidalgo of Discerning Deacons, which advocates for women deacons in the church, said she hopes Leo will support the church\u2019s ongoing review of women\u2019s participation in ministry. A years-long Vatican process left open the contentious question of whether women should be ordained as deacons.",
      "Hidalgo, who lives in Miami, heard then-Cardinal Prevost speak in February when she was in Rome for a celebration of deacons.",
      "\u201cHe was asking deacons to be humble in their service,\u201d Hidalgo said. \"I could tell just from meeting him that that\u2019s something he really values himself ... that you are to be of service and you\u2019re there in a posture of humility.\u201d",
      "The U.S.-based Women\u2019s Ordination Conference, which advocates for women to be accepted as priests, welcomed the inclusive tone of Leo\u2019s initial remarks.",
      "\u201cHis clear emphasis on bridge-building and dialogue offer WOC hope that Pope Leo XIV might be a leader who will also build bridges to Catholic women,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said. It envisioned \u201ca long-overdue day when women are recognized as equals in Christ.\u201d",
      "Francis, in many ways, saw Robert Prevost as a possible successor, assigning him to positions in Peru that bolstered his global resume and later calling him to the Vatican to oversee the influential office that vets bishop nominations.",
      "\u201cFrancis was paying close attention to new U.S bishops,\u201d said Millies, the public theology professor. \u201cPrevost has been Francis\u2019 man overseeing the careful selection of a different sort of bishop to fill important posts in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Millies said the top leadership of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \u2014 which was sometimes at odds with Francis \u2014 remains relatively conservative.",
      "But in the ranks of bishops below them, \u201cthe change has already happened,\u201d Millies said. \u201cThey are men who are more pastoral than focused on doctrine. The election of Leo means we are firmly in a different era.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, the taboo against a U.S. pope reflected reluctance to give the world's No. 1 superpower even more influence. That shouldn't be a concern with Leo, according to Austen Ivereigh, a British-based journalist and author of two books on the Francis papacy.",
      "\u201cIf anybody thinks he (Leo) is going to take a different line from Francis on migration or climate change, they\u2019re in for a surprise,\" Ivereigh said. \"Francis was putting into practice church teaching, and Leo will do the same.\u201d",
      "There was muted reaction to Leo's election from Bishop Robert Strickland, who was ousted by Francis in 2023 from leadership of the Diocese of Tyler in Texas. Strickland had been a fierce critic of Francis and came to symbolize the polarization within the U.S. hierarchy.",
      "In social media posts after Leo assumed the papacy, Strickland expressed hope that he would faithfully uphold the sacred Scriptures and traditions known as the Deposit of Faith.",
      "\u201cWith the heavy weight of the papacy now on his shoulders he needs our prayers,\u201d Strickland added.",

      "The United States is pulling back from its role in spreading democratic ideals abroad under President Donald Trump",
      "CHICAGO -- Growing up in the former Soviet Union, Pedro Spivakovsky-Gonzalez\u2019s father and grandparents would listen to Voice of America with their ears pressed to the radio, trying to catch words through the government\u2019s radio jamming.",
      "The U.S.-funded news service was instrumental in helping them understand what was happening on the other side of the Iron Curtain, before they moved to the United States in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cIt was a window into another world,\u201d Spivakovsky-Gonzalez said. \u201cThey looked to it as a sort of a beacon of freedom. They were able to imagine a different world from the one they were living in.\u201d",
      "When Spivakovsky-Gonzalez and his family heard of President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media \u2014 the agency that oversees VOA, Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia \u2013- he said it was a \u201cgut punch.\u201d",
      "The first months of the second Trump administration have delivered blow after blow to American efforts to promote democracy abroad and pierce the information wall of authoritarian governments through programs that had been sustained over decades by presidents of both political parties.",
      "The new administration has decimated the Agency for Global Media, restructured the State Department to eliminate a global democracy office and gutted the U.S. Agency for International Development, which just last year launched an initiative to try to halt democratic backsliding across the globe. In all, the moves represent a retrenchment from the U.S. role in spreading democracy beyond its borders.",
      "Experts say the moves will create a vacuum for promoting freedom and representative government, and could accelerate what many see as anti-democratic trends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe United States has historically been the leading power in spreading democracy globally. Despite different administrations, that has remained the case \u2013- until now,\u201d said Staffan Lindberg, a political science professor at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.",
      "David Salvo, managing director for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, said promoting democracy abroad has been \u201ca pillar of American foreign policy in the last 50 years\u201d as a means of ensuring more stable, peaceful relationships with other countries, reducing the threat of conflict and war, and fostering economic cooperation.",
      "Yet among Trump\u2019s early actions was targeting democracy programs through the State Department and USAID, which had launched a new global democracy initiative at the tail end of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The Treasury Department halted funding to the National Endowment for Democracy, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in April he would shutter a State Department office that had a mission to build \u201cmore democratic, secure, stable, and just societies.\u201d",
      "Funding cuts have hit the National Democratic Institute, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems and U.S. nonprofits that have worked for decades \u201cto inject resources into environments so that civil society and democratic actors can try to effect change for the better,\u201d including through bolstering unstable democracies against autocrats, Salvo said.",
      "Whether global democracy programs are worth funding was central to a hearing Thursday held by a U.S. House Foreign Affairs subcommittee as Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., repeatedly asked how to \u201censure our return on investment is really high.\u201d",
      "About 1.2% of the federal budget went to foreign aid in the 2023 fiscal year, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cI understand the committee is interested in how we can improve ... and get back to basics,\u201d Tom Malinowski, a former Democratic congressman from New Jersey and assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor under President Barack Obama, told lawmakers. \u201cThe problem is the administration is eliminating the basics right now.\u201d",
      "Uzra Zeya, who leads the international nonprofit Human Rights First after serving in the Biden State Department, said it was \u201cheartbreaking and alarming\" to watch the U.S. essentially dismantle its democracy and human rights programs.",
      "\"The potential long-term impacts are devastating for U.S. national security and prosperity,\" she said.",
      "For more than 80 years, VOA and its related outlets have delivered news across the world, including to more than 427 million people every week in 49 languages, according to a 2024 internal report. The broadcaster began during World War II to provide Germans with news, even as Nazi officials attempted to jam its signals. The Soviet Union and China attempted to silence its broadcasts during the Cold War. Iranian and North Korean governments have also tried to block access to VOA for decades.",
      "But the most successful attempt to silence VOA has been through its own government. It was effectively shut down in March through an executive order.",
      "Lisa Brakel, a 66-year-old retired librarian in Temperance, Michigan, said VOA was a \u201cmainstay\u201d when she was a music teacher in Kuwait in the 1980s. She and her colleagues would listen together in the apartment complex where the American teachers were housed, using it as a way to stay up-to-date with U.S. news.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the news, I thought, \u2018No, they can\u2019t shut this down. Too many people depend on that,\u2019\u201d Brakel said. \u201cAs a librarian, any cuts to free access to information deeply concern me.\u201d",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s future remains in flux after a federal appellate court paused a ruling that would have reversed its dismantling. This was just a day after journalists were told they would soon return to work after being off the air for almost two months. Even if they are allowed back, it's not clear the mission would be the same. This past week, the Trump administration agreed to use the conservative and heavily pro-Trump media network OAN\u2019s feed on VOA and other services.",
      "In Asia, dismantling Radio Free Asia would mean losing the world\u2019s only independent Uyghur language news service, closing the Asia Fact Check Lab as it reports on misinformation from the Chinese Community Party, and curbing access to information in countries such as China, North Korea and Myanmar that lack free and independent media, the broadcaster\u2019s president, Bay Fang, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cTheir invaluable work is part of RFA\u2019s responsibility to uphold the truth so that dictators and despots don\u2019t have the last word,\u201d Fang wrote in May in The New York Times.",

      "GENEVA -- The lead U.S. negotiator in trade talks with China cheered \u201ca great deal of productivity\u201d in resolving differences between the world\u2019s two leading economic powers, after officials wrapped two days of bargaining in Switzerland following President Donald Trump imposing steep tariffs and Beijing retaliating.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday there was \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in the weekend sessions but offered scant information on exactly what negotiations entailed. He said more details would come at a briefing Monday.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested that an agreement had been reached but provided no details. He and Bessent briefly addressed reporters once talks had wrapped at the stately villa that serves as the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, but did not take questions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\u201d Greer said.

      "The White House subsequently issued a statement titled, \u201cU.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva\u201d but offering only the same quotes by Bessent and Greer.",
      "The Chinese delegation held a subsequent news conference where it described what occurred as \u201ccandid, in-depth and constructive dialogue.\" Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said both sides had agreed to \u201cestablishing a consultation mechanism\u201d for further discussions on trade and economic issues.",
      "China's negotiators also said that they and the U.S. team would be releasing a joint statement on Monday \u2014 though the timing was still uncertain.",
      "\u201cI think, no matter when this statement is released, it\u2019s going to be good news for the world,\u201d said Li Chenggang, the Chinese ambassador to the World Trade Organization.",
      "Trump was anxious to declare the sessions a win. Even before the final day of talks opened on Sunday, the president posed on his social media site that \u201cGREAT PROGRESS\u201d was being made toward what he suggested could be a \u201ctotal reset\u201d on the tariffs that have put the global economy on edge.",
      "Beijing, however, appeared largely more measured about the negotiations' overall direction, noting in a Saturday night editorial published before the second day of negotiations kicked off, that it would \u201cfirmly reject any proposal that compromises core principles or undermines the broader cause of global equity.\u201d",
      "During the Sunday evening news conference, He said \u201cglobal trade wars that were provoked or initiated by the U.S. have captured global attention\u201c but \u201cChina\u2019s position towards this trade war has been clear and consistent, and that is: China doesn\u2019t want to fight a trade war, because trade wars produce no winners.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut if the U.S. insists on forcing this war upon us, China will not be afraid of it and will fight to the end,\u201d the vice premier said, before adding: \u201cWe are ready to work together.\u201d",
      "Negotiations could go a long way toward stabilizing world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff that has ships in port with goods from China unwilling to unload until they get final word on tariffs.",
      "Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries\u2019 boycotting each other\u2019s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Still, top members of the Trump administration were following the president's lead in insisting that a hard reset of U.S.-China trade relations could be in the offing.",
      "\u201cSecretary Bessent has made clear that one of his objectives is to de-escalate,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who wasn't in Geneva, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He added that the U.S. and China have both imposed tariffs that are \u201ctoo high to do business, but that\u2019s why they are talking right now.\"",
      "\u201cWe are the consumer of the world. Everybody wants to sell their goods here,\" Lutnick said. So they need to do business with America and we\u2019re using the power of our economy to open their economy to our exporters.\"",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen in all likelihood is that relationships are going to be rebooted. It looks like the Chinese are very, very eager to play ball and to renormalize things.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re essentially starting over, starting from scratch with the Chinese,\u201d Hassett said \"and they seem to think that they really want to rebuild a relationship that\u2019s great for both of us.\u201d",
      "The talks mark the first time the sides have met face-to-face to discuss the issues. The prospects for a major breakthrough still appear slight, but even a small drop in tariffs \u2014 particularly if taken simultaneously \u2014 could help restore some confidence.",
      "\u201cNegotiations to begin de-escalating the growing US\u2013China trade war are badly needed and it\u2019s a positive sign that both sides were able to gracefully move beyond their bickering over who had to call first,\u201d Jake Werner, director of the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said in an email.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on countries worldwide, but its fight with China has been the most intense. Trump's import taxes on goods from China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States.",
      "The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump\u2019s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",

      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones Apple iPhones made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Stryven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",
      "In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.",
      "Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.",

      "He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.",

      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",

      "The biggest single decision, however, is the fact that the 10% so-called reciprocal tariff stays, even though the UK buys more from the US than the other way around. This confirms that the tariff is not negotiable for anybody, and could have wider consequences.",

      "From the US perspective, the trebling of tariffs is a tax on foreigners that \"wins\" revenue for US Treasury. From the UK perspective, the tariff is a tax on domestic consumers that increases inflation, so a lower value is in and of itself good.",
      "Over at the Bank of England, the lack of retaliation and acceptance of diverted goods from Asia are among the reasons that inflation is now rising more gently, which has enabled today's interest rate cut with more to come.",

      "The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year.",
      "That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs.",
      "\"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\"",

      "The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative.",
      "The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.",

      "\"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say.",
      "Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail.",
      "\"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\"",

      "The root cause of a fire which led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport and affected hundreds of thousands of journeys worldwide \"remains unknown\", an interim report says.",
      "Heathrow was closed to all flights for much of 21 March after a fire at a nearby electrical substation, which started the previous night, caused a power outage at the airport.",
      "In Thursday's report, the National Energy System Operator (Neso) said a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation in Hayes, west London.",

      "The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit carried out an initial investigation into the fire, but Neso noted that detectives found there \"no evidence to suggest\" the incident was suspicious.",
      "The power outage and subsequent closure of Heathrow led to more than 270,000 journeys being affected.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband shortly after ordered an urgent investigation into the fire to prevent it \"from ever happening again\", and told Neso to provide its initial findings within six weeks.",

      "The power outage affected 66,919 domestic and commercial customers, including Heathrow Airport, Neso said.",

      "Neso's chief executive Fintan Slye said: \"It is important that the right lessons are learnt from this incident to prevent future instances where possible and to manage them effectively when they do occur.\"",
      "Power was restored to Heathrow's substations by 06:25 using circuits from another nearby substation, Neso said, and the flow of electricity to all four of Heathrow's passenger terminals was restarted by 10:56.",
      "But Flights did not resume until after 18:00 that day, once safety checks were completed. Planes were able to land and take off through the night to allow Heathrow to get back up to full capacity.",
      "Neso said the re-energisation of the entire airport was only fully completed by 14:23.",
      "Other customers' power was restored by 12:24, the report said, and supply from the North Hyde substation was reinstated the following day.",
      "Heathrow relies on three electricity substations, and has emergency back-up power supplies, such as diesel generators and batteries - but these only keep crucial safety systems running, such as landing equipment and runway lights.",
      "Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye previously said the shutdown was caused not by a lack of power but by the time it took to switch from the damaged substation's supply to the other operational substations.",
      "Due to Heathrow's \"size and operational complexity\", managers decided to close the airport on safety grounds while this took place.",
      "The airport said at the time that its objective \"was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire\".",
      "Neso confirmed that the restoration of power to the airport was followed by \"a period of safety checking\" to ensure \"safety critical systems were fully operational prior to passengers arriving at the airport\".",

    "summary": "As the president goes to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE he wants them to buy more from the States.",
    "story": [
      "With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy.",
      "\"President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],\" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.",
      "\"He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.\"",
      "Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.",
      "The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",
      "Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.",
      "Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results.",
      "The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.",
      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",
      "According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.",
      "\"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.",
      "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'",
      "US economy shrinks as firms import more ahead of tariffs",
      "Optimism and uncertainty at summit as Middle East awaits Trump\u2019s return",
      "Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid.",
      "Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.",
      "Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken \"with a little bit of a grain of salt\".",
      "Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items.",
      "These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft.",
      "The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen.",
      "The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder.",
      "The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.",
      "Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a \"more efficient procurement system\", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily.",
      "\"The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,\" he adds.",
      "Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors.",
      "The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil.",
      "The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states.",
      "The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE.",
      "\"For the UAE, this is absolutely essential,\" says Ms Young. \"They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best.\"",
      "While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program.",
      "Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil.",
      "It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports.",
      "However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital.",
      "The fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained Riyadh's finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals.",
      "Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low amid growing concerns that a trade war could dampen global economic growth.",
      "The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.",
      "Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump, who has called for lower oil prices.",
      "Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing.",
      "The US-Saudi Business Council, is an organisation that aims to boost trade ties between the two countries.",
      "It is hoping that Trump's visit will push American businesses to explore more opportunities in Saudi Arabia, especially in sectors like AI, healthcare and education.",
      "\"The Saudi government is looking heavily to invest in these sectors. There is a very big appetite for Saudi companies to collaborate with American companies,\" Hutham Al Jalal, who heads the Riyadh office for the organisation, tells the BBC.",
      "Saudi officials are said to be confident that some deals in these sectors will be secured during Trump's visit.",
      "For Saudi Arabia, Trump's visit is about strengthening ties with their longest-standing Western ally - a relationship that grew strained during the Biden years. For President Trump, it is about landing investment deals that can be framed as a win for his economic agenda.",
      "\"President Trump is looking for a headline of big investments in America, and he will get that from this trip,\" adds Mr Shihabi.",

    "summary": "The BBC's Emma Simpson gets a rare glimpse behind the scenes of how the fashion brand operates.",
    "story": [
      "It's going to be a very sexy summer, a touch of romantic, cowboy and rock and roll.",
      "That's according to Mehdi Sousanne, at least. And he should know. He's a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand that's one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion.",
      "Zara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.",
      "It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries.",
      "Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates.",
      "It's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.",
      "But Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market.",
      "\"Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change,\" he tells me.",
      "The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna.",
      "It now has 350 designers, with the staff coming from some 40 different countries.",
      "\"There are no rules in general. It's all about feelings,\" says Mehdi, who works on delivering the key pieces for the season.",
      "He says inspiration can come from anyone ranging from the \"street\" to the cinema\u00a0 as well as the catwalks. He likes to sketch his ideas once an all-important mood board has been created.",
      "Listen as the BBC goes behind the scenes at Zara's headquarters",
      "Listen as the BBC goes behind the scenes at Zara's headquarters",
      "In the pattern cutting room, the designs are turned into paper samples, and are pinned on to mannequins. Dozens of seamstresses then run up the first fabric samples on the spot for a first fitting.",
      "Pattern maker Mar Marcote has been with the business 42 years and still uses a magnifying glass to examine each item of clothing before it finally goes into production.",
      "\"When you finish the item and see that it looks good, and then sometimes sells out, it's marvellous,\" she says.",
      "Zara is a business that has changed the way we shop.",
      "In the old days, retailers released just two main collections a year, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter. For decades, most chains have outsourced manufacturing to lower-cost factories in the far east with the clothes arriving up to six months later.",
      "Zara went against conventional wisdom by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently. That meant it could respond much faster to the latest trends and drop new items into stores every week.",
      "Just over half of its clothes are made in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. There's a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns.",
      "As a result, it can turn around products in a matter of weeks.",
      "More basic fashion staples are produced with longer lead times in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.",
      "Logistics and data are other factors behind its success. Every piece of clothing is packaged and despatched from its distribution centres in Spain, as well as one in the Netherlands.",
      "\"What is absolutely critical is the level of accuracy,\" says CEO Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"It's something that allows us to make the right decision in the last possible minute, in order to assess properly the appetite from our customers, in order to adapt our fashion proposition to the profile of our customers in different locations.\"",
      "In other words, getting the right products to the right shops.",
      "At HQ, product managers then receive real-time data on how clothes are selling in stores worldwide, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 feedback from customers, which is then shared with designers and buyers, who can adjust the ranges along the season according to demand.",
      "Unlike some other High Street rivals, it only discounts when it stages its twice-yearly sales.",
      "But is Zara starting to lose its shine after posting slower sales growth at the start of this year?",
      "\"The key challenge for Inditex is continuing to be relevant in a fashion world that continues to get faster and cheaper,\" says William Woods, European retail analyst for Bernstein.",
      "Not only are mainstream rivals like H&M, Mango and Uniqlo trying to catch up, the market has been disrupted by Shein and Temu.",
      "Shein racked up $38bn in global sales last year, just a whisker behind Inditex.",
      "Asked how much of a threat Shein and Temu's success poses to Zara, Mr Maceiras stresses that its business model doesn't rely on price.",
      "\"Of course, we are looking at providing our customers our products at an affordable price. But for us, it's critical to provide customers fashion that should be inspirational, with quality, creativity and sustainable.\"",
      "Zara has come a long way since its founder Amancio Ortega started the business.",
      "The company is still majority-owned by his family and his daughter Marta is now chairwoman of the group.",
      "Now aged 89, Mr Ortega remains famously reclusive but still pops in, according to Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"He's a presence, a physical or moral presence, absolutely every day.\""

    "story": [
      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",

    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has cut interest rates for the second time this year - welcome news for first-time buyers after years of rising mortgage costs and spiralling house prices.",
      "But it's still tough. More than half of first-time buyers still rely on the so-called bank of mum and dad to get on the property ladder, with an average of \u00a355,572 given in loans and gifts last year, according to estate agents Savills.",
      "We've spoken to people on a range of incomes who have managed to make it on to the ladder or are on the brink of buying.",
      "They shared with us the tactics they used to buy.",
      "'We used a Lifetime ISA'",
      "Cameron Smith and Georgia Pickford, both 26, each opened a Lifetime ISA (LISA) in order to buy a three-bedroom flat in Hertfordshire together for \u00a3320,000 last year.",
      "The scheme allows 18 to 39-year-olds to save up to \u00a34,000 a year, with a 25% government bonus, as long as it's used to buy a home under \u00a3450,000.",
      "Cameron earns \u00a340,000 and Georgia \u00a337,000 and they each set up a direct debit to their respective LISA accounts.",
      "\"Every month, \u00a3200 came out of my paycheque \u2013 no excuses, no distractions,\" says Cameron.",
      "Cameron increased his contributions each month, and in just under three years, the couple saved \u00a327,740, including the government bonus from their LISAs and interest. Cameron saved \u00a311,800 and Georgia saved \u00a39,910. To reach the full deposit amount, they topped this up with an extra \u00a34,260 from their personal savings.",
      "But Cameron, who now shares personal finance advice online, says the scheme hasn't kept pace with rising prices.",
      "\"The \u00a3450,000 cap was set back in 2017 - it hasn't moved. If your property is even \u00a31 over that, you lose the bonus and get hit with a 25% penalty.\"",
      "Following calls from campaigners for the terms to be updated, the Treasury Committee is reviewing whether Lifetime ISAs are still fit for purpose.",
      "Brian Byrnes, head of personal finance at Moneybox, a digital savings and investment platform, still thinks the scheme is a great option for first-time buyers.",
      "\"The Lifetime ISA works fantastically well for the vast majority of customers. Less than 1% are impacted by the \u00a3450,000 cap,\" he says.",

      "Abas Rai, 26, used a type of joint mortgage known as an \"income booster mortgage\" to buy his first home - a \u00a3207,000 two-bedroom house in Suffolk.",
      "It's a product offered by some lenders that lets a family member's income be added to yours, even if they're not living in the property, to increase how much you can borrow.",
      "Even with a \u00a330,000 deposit and a \u00a333,000 salary, Abas struggled to get the loan he needed. To boost his affordability, he added his father, who earns \u00a324,000, to the mortgage.",
      "By combining their incomes, the bank was able to offer a bigger loan, though it meant his dad would also be liable if he defaults.",
      "\"The bank added our incomes together and then multiplied it by 4.5 - that's how they worked out the affordability.\"",
      "But involving a parent comes with some challenges.",
      "\"Because the person added on to the mortgage is also added on to the property, one of the risks was my dad's age - he's 55 and coming to retirement soon, so I won't be able to rely on his salary if I default on a payment.\"",
      "Abas plans to re-mortgage and remove his dad once his income increases, but says the scheme was worth it.",

      "The couple were priced out of buying near family and friends in Oxfordshire, where average house prices are \u00a3479,000, compared with \u00a3251,000 in Manchester.",
      "They began saving five years ago, and are now house-hunting in the \u00a3300,000-325,000 range with a deposit of \u00a350,000.",

      "Oliver Jones, 27, lives in London and used a shared ownership scheme to buy his first home - a two-bedroom flat worth \u00a3500,000. He bought a 25% share with a \u00a340,000 deposit and sub-lets to a long-time friend whom he used to rent with.",
      "\"We were tired of doing that dance every year with the landlord trying to hike up rent by stupid amounts,\" Oliver says. \"Now we're saving around \u00a31,000 a month compared to our old flat.\"",
      "Shared ownership schemes let buyers purchase a portion of a property and pay rent on the rest. They're often more accessible but come with complexities, like service charges and limited resale flexibility.",
      "Oliver's total monthly costs come to around \u00a31,550, including \u00a3500 for the mortgage, \u00a3800 in rent on the 75% share he doesn't own, and a \u00a3250 service charge. While he and his lodger informally split costs, Oliver covers all the housing payments.",
      "\"My mortgage rate is 5.4%, but the rent on the unowned portion is only about 2% of the property value.",
      "\"It's cheaper to just own part of the property and pay rent than to buy the whole thing with a big mortgage.\"",
      "'The Help to Buy ISA worked for me'",
      "Daniel Price, 27, bought a three-bedroom home in the South Wales Valleys earlier this year, not far from where he grew up.",
      "He started saving four and a half years ago using a Help to Buy ISA - a government scheme that topped up savings by 25%, up to a \u00a33,000 maximum bonus. It has since been replaced by the Lifetime ISA scheme.",
      "\"Originally, my mum told me about it, so I just put a pound in to open the account,\" he says.",
      "\"I paid in \u00a3200 a month and eventually saved \u00a311,000, which got me a \u00a32,500 government bonus.\"",
      "House prices in the South Wales Valleys tend to be lower than in many other parts of the UK, which can make home ownership there more achievable for first-time buyers.",
      "Daniel bought his house for \u00a395,000, below the asking price of \u00a3110,000, due to some minor renovations the property needed.",
      "\"A lot of houses were out of my price range as a single person, so I started looking further afield.\"",
      "\"My dad found the house on Rightmove and showed me it. Everything was a bit outdated, but still liveable. It just needs a bit of work to modernise it.\"",
      "When he first applied for a mortgage in October 2024, Daniel was earning \u00a318,000 a year while doing a software development apprenticeship. By the time the sale went through in January this year, his salary had risen to \u00a324,000.",

      "Camilla saved and invested a total of \u00a380,000 into the S&P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 leading companies listed on the US stock market. By steadily contributing over time and benefiting from market growth, her investment pot eventually grew to \u00a3150,000.",

    "summary": "The Bank cuts rates for the second time this year, saying the slowdown in inflation was behind the move.",
    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

      "The OfS, which regulates higher education providers, said universities were closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but \"significant reform and efficiencies\" were needed to turn the tide.",
      "It said a drop in international students coming to the UK was the main reason for the worsening financial position.",
      "Universities UK (UUK) said the report was \"deeply sobering\", while the education secretary said it demonstrated the necessity of raising tuition fees in England.",
      "The report found that 117 of 270 higher education institutions (43%) registered with the OfS expected to be in deficit by the end of July - despite course closures, job losses and selling off assets.",
      "This third consecutive year of worsening finances was mainly driven by a fall in international student numbers, it said, particularly following visa changes in January 2024.",
      "The number of international students was almost 16% lower last year than previously expected, according to the report.",
      "Universities have become increasingly reliant on higher fees from international students in recent years, as tuition fees from UK students have not kept up with inflation.",
      "Their financial plans predict that more than half of the growth in their tuition fee income up to 2028 will come from international students - but the OfS warned that this was optimistic.",
      "Susan Lapworth, chief executive of the OfS, told the BBC it was \"not currently expecting any large or medium institutions to fail over the next 12 months or so\".",
      "She said: \"Many institutions are financially secure or taking sensible steps to ensure that they're financially secure, so I wouldn't want students to be unduly concerned about these issues.\"",

      "Ms Lapworth said OfS was \"constantly thinking\" about when students might need to be told about the situation at those institutions, explaining: \"We know that if the regulator says 'we're working with a particular university', the risk is that its financial failure is then precipitated by simply saying that.\"",

      "\"Further reforms are needed to fix the foundations of higher education, and universities must do more to make their finances work,\" she added.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of UUK, which represents 141 institutions, said the report was \"deeply sobering\" but not surprising given frozen domestic tuition fees, visa changes and \"a longstanding failure of research grants to cover costs\".",
      "She said universities were doing \"everything they can\" to manage costs and that a UUK sector-wide taskforce would \"unlock greater efficiencies\".",
      "But she added: \"The scale of the challenge means none of this will be enough without government on the pitch too.\"",
      "Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said universities were \"under severe financial stress\".",
      "\"Over 10,000 jobs are already set to disappear from the sector as vice-chancellors attempt to bin courses and cut student provision to the bone,\" she said.",

      "Universities are now anxiously awaiting the government's draft plan for managing immigration,  which is expected to further limit visas for students applying from Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.",
      "Attracting international students who pay higher fees and spend money in the UK is counted as an export.  The rule change in January 2024 prevented postgraduate students from bringing relatives, and has led to a drop in numbers applying.",
      "The higher fees paid by international students have been used to prop up university finances after many years in which tuition fees for students in England have barely increased.",
      "While fees are due to go up this autumn to \u00a39,535 for students in England,  ministers have yet to say what will happen in following years.",

      "\"That was well done,\" he said. \"They pulled it off, because they managed to flog the goods and palm off a $4m ring in Antwerp, which isn't that easy,\" he added.",
      "In his testimony, Ouatiki also painted a frightening picture of one of the burglars who he said was wielding a gun and was \"stressed and shouting\u2026 You feel that's someone that can be very dangerous.\"",
      "Ouatiki acted as an interpreter between the man and Kardashian and said he did his best to \"calm things down as I didn't know what he was capable of\".",
      "When the burglars tied up Kardashian and took her to the bathroom, she was only wearing a bathrobe and the belt came undone, the court heard. Asked by Kardashian's lawyer L\u00e9onore Hennerick to describe the moment, Ouatiki declined to go into detail. \"You have to respect the victim, I think,\" he said.",
      "Referencing that moment in an emotional interview in 2020, Kardashian told American journalist David Letterman that she thought she was going to be sexually assaulted.",
      "\"I was like, 'Okay, this is the time I'm going to get raped',\" she said.",
      "She added that she feared for her life and that she was worried for her sister Kourtney, who was out at a club: \"I'm gonna be dead in the room and she's gonna be traumatised for the rest of her life.\"",
      "Instead, the burglars grabbed her ring as well as various other jewels, phone and \u20ac1,000 in cash and ran off. Kardashian was quickly able to untie herself and her bodyguard arrived shortly after. She gave a statement to police in the early hours of 3 October and immediately flew back to the US.",
      "For his part, Ouatiki \u2013 an Algerian national who at the time was a PhD student in semiotics \u2013 said he suffered greatly from speculation in the media that he may have been in on the heist.",
      "\"The suspicion was very heavy to bear,\" he told the court.",
      "Ouatiki told French media he lost his student status shortly after the heist and had to go back to Algeria, where he was diagnosed with PTSD.",
      "\"It was a catastrophe, my life fell apart,\" he told Le Point.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Simone Bretter, Kardashian's friend and stylist, will take the stand. She was staying in the same suite during the heist but was on a different floor and hid when she realised burglars had broken in.",
      "Almost 500 journalists are accredited and Kardashian's testimony is set to attract huge media attention.",
      "\"Testifying will allow her to reclaim agency in this situation and rewrite the ending,\" said Jeetendr Sehdev, celebrity expert and the author of The Kim Kardashian Principle.",
      "\"In 2016 she was the punchline. But in 2025 testifying is going to turn her into the narrator,\" he told the BBC."

      "Are you prepared for how overwhelming Eurovision week is?",
      "Lauren: Yeah, but we're quite good at immersing ourselves in what we're doing.",

      "Mr Loverman and Mr Bates vs the Post Office were among the big winners at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards, in a night which threw up several surprise winners.",
      "ITV's dramatisation of the post office scandal, which led to widespread public outcry about the false convictions of sub-postmasters, was named best drama series, while ITV was given a special award to recognise the show's impact.",
      "Producer Patrick Spence said: \"This story only had the impact it did because the people that watched it stood up and demanded action with rage.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr Loverman, about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend is revealed, won two major acting prizes.",

      "In pictures: Stars walk the red carpet",
      "A wedding dress, party plans and Alan Cumming's four suits",
      "Accepting the prize for limited series on behalf of Mr Bates vs the Post Office, Spence said the response to the show proved that the public \"cannot abide liars and bullies\".",
      "He added that \"maybe it is a warning to those who are supposed to have our backs, that they'd better not abuse that power\", and said: \"Our show didn't change the law, the people of this nation did that.\"",
      "Managing director of ITV Studios, Kevin Lygo, said it was \"part of a long tradition on TV\" that such dramas \"shine a light on corruption, criminality, miscarriages of justice... but nothing, I think, has had quite the effects Mr Bates has had\".",
      "However, two of the drama's main stars Toby Jones and Monica Dolan missed out on acting prizes.",
      "Instead, best leading actress went to Industry star Marisa Abela, while best leading and supporting actor were won by Mr Loverman's Lennie James and Ariyon Bakare respectively.",
      "\"I didn't think this was coming my way,\" said James, describing his win as a \"fantastic honour\", as he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, including David Tennant, Martin Freeman and Richard Gadd.",
      "James paid tribute to Bernardine Evaristo, who wrote the book the series was based on. \"Thank you for trusting us with your characters,\" he said.",
      "Bakare, who played his lover, said: \"This award stands on the shoulders of those who came before me, those who might have been afraid to come out, to be who what they want to be, and I just say thank you for them.\"",
      "Abela, who has also played Amy Winehouse in the musical biopic Back To Black, described her leading actress win as \"insane\".",
      "She noted that she was cast in the show, about a group of young finance graduates, \"when I was in my final year of drama school, and my agent who signed me in my final year is here tonight - Saskia thank you so much for believing in me\".",
      "\"I've been filming Industry for about six years now, and Bad Wolf and HBO, the fact that they let us carry on after season one, it's mental. They're the best.\"",
      "Ruth Jones won best female comedy performance for her role in Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, which was broadcast at Christmas and brought the hugely popular sitcom to a close.",
      "She accepted her award in character as Nessa, beginning her speech in her alter-ego's distinctive Welsh accent and saying: \"I'm not gonna lie, this is immense.",
      "\"I've won a Bafta before, course I have, in 1976,\" she continued as Nessa. \"It was the Barry Arcade Fruit Technician Award.\"",
      "She concluded her speech - returning to herself - by thanking her \"dear, talented, lovely, kind, funny friend, James Corden, with whom I have shared this astonishing journey for the past 17 years, and without whom, Nessa Shanessa Jenkins would not exist\".",
      "There was another Gavin & Stacey reference elsewhere in the ceremony, when host Alan Cumming asked Rob Brydon to finally answer the question of what happened on the show's notorious fishing trip.",
      "As Brydon began to speak, Cumming interrupted: \"Oh, sorry, Rob. We've got to go straight on with the next award. We'll pick it up at next year's Baftas.\"",
      "Danny Dyer won best male comedy performance for his role in Mr Bigstuff, in which he played one of two brothers with wildly different personalities who try to patch up their sibling rivalry.",
      "Dyer said he was \"choked up\" by his win, before joking: \"So my acting was so bad, it was funny?\"",
      "In an expletive-laden speech, he said it had been \"an honour to share the screen\" with his co-star Harriet Webb, and thanked writer and co-star Ryan Sampson, who he called the \"best thing to come out of Rotherham\".",
      "\"He's never done the same thing twice, which is not something I can say,\" Dyer joked. \"You wrote this part, you won this for me mate, I really appreciate it.\"",
      "Blue Lights, a police drama set in Northern Ireland, was named best drama series, Alma's Not Normal won best scripted comedy, and EastEnders was named best soap, in the year it celebrates 40 years on air.",
      "The Traitors missed out on the three prizes it was nominated for, with best reality series instead going to Channel 4's Jury: Murder Trial, which restaged a trial of murder in front of two juries of ordinary people.",
      "Baby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning won best supporting actress, repeating her earlier wins at the Golden Globes, Emmys and SAG Awards.",
      "\"Gosh thank you Bafta, wow,\" she said. \"I sometimes do this kind of cheesy thing where I look back on the younger me and moments in my life, and I imagine the kind of then me, seeing me now, and think, 'little did we know'.\"",
      "She said she was so proud to be part of this show before saying co-star Richard Gadd \"changed my life\". She concluded by wishing him: \"Happy birthday, nipple.\"",
      "Rylan Clark and Rob Rinder won the factual entertainment prize for their Italian travel series, Rob & Rylan's Grand Tour.",
      "\"We didn't know what we were making when we landed in Venice,\" reflected Clark.",
      "When he saw the programme's edit, \"I said, 'we're either going to get cancelled or we're going to win a Bafta, and I'm so glad it was the latter!\"",
      "Rinder thanked the pair's mothers, \"for allowing us to be our true selves,\" before Rylan joked: \"And BBC Arts, now we won a Bafta, can we have a bigger styling budget?\"",
      "Elsewhere, Would I Lie To You? was named best entertainment programme.",
      "Panelist Lee Mack noted the show had never previously won despite being nominated eight times, and joked that Bafta's change of sponsor to P&O Cruises, which host Rob Brydon used to front adverts for, might have had an effect.",
      "\"The whiff of scandal hangs heavy in the air,\" laughed Brydon, but reassured the audience: \"I stopped those adverts five years ago, there is no connection.\"",
      "Kirsty Wark, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last summer after 30 years, received the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy.",
      "Wark said it was a \"privilege and an honour\" to be recognised.",
      "\"Things have changed so much and so radically since the 70s, not least the shoulder pads, the office drinks trolley, and film crews the size of football teams, but always the chance to learn and go.",
      "\"I've been lucky to interviews politicians to painters, architects to economists, musicians and a few monsters.\" She paid tribute to her colleagues, saying: \"It takes a village to raise a programme.\"",

      "Strictly Come Dancing won the memorable moment prize, the only award of the night voted for by the public, for blind comedian Chris McCausland's waltz to You'll Never Walk Alone",
      "His professional dance partner Diane Buswell said it was \"such an honour\" to win, joking: \"Chris is not here tonight, but that's what happens when he insists on driving himself to these kinds of events.\"",
      "\"He told me to say that,\" she laughed, before reading out a message on McCausland's behalf: \"After 22 years in comedy, I win a Bafta for dancing. It hurts, but I'll take it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Dua Lipa, Sir Elton John,  Sir Ian McKellen and Florence Welch are among a list of stars calling on the prime minister to update copyright laws in a way that protects them from artificial intelligence.",
      "A letter signed by more than 400 British musicians, writers and artists, addressed to Sir Keir Starmer, says failing to give that protection would mean them \"giving away\" their work to tech firms.",
      "Also at risk, they write, is \"the UK's position as a creative powerhouse\".",
      "They want the PM to back an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill that would require developers to be transparent with copyright owners about using their material to train AI models.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"We want our creative industries and AI companies to flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors.",
      "\"We're clear that no changes will be considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators,\" they added.",
      "Other signatories include author Kazuo Ishiguro, playwright David Hare, singers Kate Bush and Robbie Williams, as well as Coldplay, Tom Stoppard and Richard Curtis.",
      "Sir Paul McCartney, who told the BBC in January he was concerned about AI ripping off artists, has also signed the letter.",
      "\"We are wealth creators, we reflect and promote the national stories, we are the innovators of the future, and AI needs us as much as it needs energy and computer skills,\" it states.",
      "They say their concerns can be met if the government backs an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron ahead of a key vote in the House of Lords on Monday.",
      "Baroness Kidron's amendment, it says, would \"allow both AI developers and creators to develop licensing regimes that will allow for human-created content well into the future.\"",
      "Not everyone agrees with the artists' approach.",
      "Julia Willemyns, co-founder of the Centre for British Progress think tank, said such proposals could hamper the UK and its bid for growth.",
      "The measures would \"do nothing to stop foreign firms from using content from the British creative industries,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"A restrictive copyright regime would offshore AI development, chill domestic innovation, and directly harm the UK economy,\" she said.",
      "However, the letter comes amid mounting concern from artists over the inclusion of their works, and material protected by copyright, in the data used to develop generative AI systems.",
      "These tools, which can produce new content in response to simple text prompts, have become increasingly popular and available to consumers.",
      "But their capabilities have been accompanied by concerns and criticism over their data use and energy demand.",
      "What is AI, how does it work and what are the concerns about it?",
      "What is AI, how does it work and what are the concerns about it?",
      "In February, artists including Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn released a silent album to protest about the government's proposed changes to copyright law.",
      "The government carried out a consultation around its proposal to allow developers to be able to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to \"opt out\".",
      "According to The Guardian, ministers were reconsidering the proposal following creator backlash.",
      "Mr Ishiguro pointed the BBC to an earlier statement in which he wrote, \"why is it just and fair - why is it sensible - to alter our time-honoured copyright laws to advantage mammoth corporations at the expense of individual writers, musicians, film-makers and artists?\"",
      "The Nobel Prize-winning author added that since then the only limited advance was that it now appeared the government had accepted the opt-out proposals were not likely to be workable, He thought a new consultation to find a fairer scheme was possible, though it remained to be seen how meaningful any consultation would be.",
      "\"It's essential that they get this right,\" he wrote.",
      "MPs recently rejected a separate amendment tabled by Baroness Kidron that aimed to make AI developers accountable to UK copyright law.",
      "Now, she says transparency obligations for tech firms under the new proposed amendment could support the development of licensing agreements between creators and companies.",
      "\"The UK is in a unique position to take its place as a global player in the international AI supply chain, but to grasp that opportunity requires the transparency provided for in my amendments, which are essential to create a vibrant licencing market,\" Baroness Kidron said.",
      "In their statement the government said: \"It's vital we take the time to work through the range of responses to our consultation, but equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps.",
      "\"That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment \u2013 exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.\"",

      "The 55-year-old was arrested last September and faces charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him.",
      "Dozens of prospective jurors were screened before being whittled down to 12 - and six alternates.",
      "The first week of testimony will include two witnesses who are expected to speak briefly, prosecutors said, followed by a third witness who will see more time on the stand.",
      "Mr Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people. He has said the individual lawsuits are attempts \"for a quick payday\".",
      "How can I follow the trial?",
      "The court is expected to be open to the public, but proceedings will not be televised or streamed online.",
      "Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.",
      "The trial proceedings began in early May with jury selection at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.",

      "How were jurors selected?",

      "The process included potential jurors looking through a long list of places and people that could be mentioned during trial, with names like Kanye West and Kid Cudi.",
      "The \"People and Places\" list was so long that Judge Subramanian said he \"felt like I was reading an appendix for Lord of the Rings\".",
      "Potential jurors also had to fill out questionnaires that asked whether they had \"views about hip hop artists\" or \"feelings concerning violence, sexual assault\".",
      "The judge reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury.",
      "Nearly all the potential jurors had read news reports of the allegations in the case and many had seen footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway.",
      "What are the charges and allegations against Diddy?",
      "In the federal criminal case being heard in New York, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Many of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.",
      "This includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.",
      "In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",

      "In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"",
      "Mr Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape.",
      "That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims.",
      "His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Mr Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor.",

      "In a hearing in New York a week before the trial officially began, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal.",
      "They said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers.",
      "At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal.",

      "\"Lights, camera\u2026 tariff?\" - that's the question a scrambling movie industry has been asking this week after an unexpected intervention from US President Donald Trump.",
      "Writing on his Truth Social platform last Sunday, Trump announced plans to hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he attempts to stop Hollywood dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "His threat comes as studios increasingly shift productions abroad to places such as the UK.",
      "The White House has since clarified that \"no final decision\" has been made and that they're \"exploring all options\" for revitalising the US film industry.",
      "But Trump's suggestion alone has sent shockwaves through the industry - from Hollywood to Hertfordshire - so what might all of this mean in practice?",
      "In 2014, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was shot by Disney at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, and Hollywood has kept growing closer to the UK since.",
      "Last year alone, the British Film Institute says 65% of UK production spend came from the five major US film studios and three US streaming giants - Netflix, Apple and Amazon. This amounted to \u00a31.37bn ($1.71bn), a near 50% jump on 2023.",
      "In Hollywood, by contrast, film and television production in Los Angeles has dropped by nearly 40% over the past decade.",
      "The reason? Well largely, it's cheaper to make films in the UK. That's thanks to generous tax incentives such as the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate - as well as lower labour costs and centralised national funding for film.",
      "As British actor Brian Cox told Times Radio on Tuesday: \"The reality is films go where they can afford.\"",
      "For Universal's blockbuster Jurassic World: Dominion, these incentives delivered a reported \u00a389.1m ($111.38m) in savings.",
      "In the US, tax incentives operate on a state level - and Hollywood has relatively poor tax breaks - not only compared with the UK, which can offer 10% more, but other states such as New York and Georgia, too.",
      "Fixing that is no easy task. Trump has appointed Golden Globe Award-winning actor Jon Voight, 86, as a special ambassador to Hollywood, and met with him a day before dropping his light-on-detail proposal.",
      "But it's not exactly clear how tariffs would solve the internal tax problem in the US. A possible solution, raised by Voight, is a federal tax incentive to mirror the UK.",
      "The Wrap's film reporter Jeremy Fuster tells the BBC it is \"unlikely\", in the current highly-charged climate, that Republicans would \"support a federal tax incentive that can easily be portrayed as a handout to 'woke Hollywood'\".",
      "And what would the impact be on moviegoers if the levy goes ahead?",
      "Fuster says costs, like any other tariffed good, would be passed onto audiences through ticket prices, premium on-demand increases or subscription rates.",

    "summary": "With just a week to go, here's our guide to the songs and artists taking part in Eurovision 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations.",
      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, R\u00f3a, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",
      "Montenegro's Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107 tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodo\u0161li, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad.",
      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",
      "Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 23:31:16 GMT",
    "summary": "After being dismissed as \"indie landfill\", many guitar bands are back with a vengeance after 20 years.",
    "story": [
      "\"I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself.\"",
      "Luke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer.",
      "Both admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur.",
      "\"But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,\" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie.",
      "\"It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other.\"",
      "The Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom \u2013 a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump.",
      "Over the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts.",
      "Angular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day.",
      "By 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkeys' incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out.",
      "But the party couldn't last forever.",
      "In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves.",
      "Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"?",
      "Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal).",
      "\"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer.",
      "\"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\"",
      "\"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\"",
      "In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld.",
      "But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes.",
      "\"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer.",
      "The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album.",
      "The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences.",
      "But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Na\u00efve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok.",
      "Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience.",
      "How do they explain this sudden revival?",
      "\"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes.",
      "\"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\"",
      "But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse.",
      "\"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff.",
      "\"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\"",
      "Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\".",
      "But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs.",
      "\"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer.",
      "A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry.",
      "The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 \u2013 making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies.",
      "Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up.",
      "The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise.",
      "\"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer.",
      "\"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\"",
      "Are there any reviews seared into their memories?",
      "\"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\"",
      "\"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\"",
      "While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music.",
      "\"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\"",
      "\"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests.",
      "\"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\"",
      "But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman.",
      "Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world.",
      "\"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\"",
      "\"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now.",
      "\"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\"",
      "With hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records.",
      "Pritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week.",
      "\"I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,\" he says.",
      "\"So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started -  not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again.\"",
      "The result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves.",
      "Archer is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year.",
      "So, have the bands got a five-year plan?",
      "\"Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,\" laughs Pritchard. \"I think it's good to have goals!\"",
      "\"Do you really?\" asks Archer, with a concerned frown.",
      "\"I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.\""

    "summary": "Eurovision songwriters, judges and more discuss crafting the ideal anthem.",
    "story": [
      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",

      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "story": [
      "Richard Monetti was aged just 20 when he was flying home to New York from London for the Christmas holidays, after studying abroad as one of 35 students from Syracuse University.",
      "But he and everyone else on the plane never made it home.",
      "They lost their lives in the UK's most deadly terror atrocity, when a bomb in the hold of their flight, Pan Am 103, exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie.",
      "It killed 270 people from 21 countries, including 11 people on the ground, and this devastating event has now been dramatised in an upcoming BBC drama series, The Bombing of Pan Am 103.",
      "Kara Weipz still recalls how she and her family found out her brother Richard was among the dead - they heard it for the first time on a news report about the bombing.",
      "As well as adding to their trauma, she says it also highlighted faults in the response system for victims' families.",
      "\"I think it was very important to make sure those lessons were learned - like families had to be notified before names could be released,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"We didn't have that luxury in 1988, when names were released before we were notified. So that's something that came out of it, and changed as a result.\"",
      "As president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 group, a role she took on from her father Bob Monetti, she says it's crucial that relatives \"know what rights they have\", while stressing the group's role in \"educating those who deal with victims\".",
      "Those lessons went on to improve how victims' families were treated in the aftermath of 9/11, when four planes flying over the eastern US were seized simultaneously by hijackers, killing 2,977 people.",
      "Screenwriter Gillian Roger Park, who was born just a couple of days before the Lockerbie bombing and grew up not far from the Scottish town, is a co-writer on the series.",
      "It dramatises the Scots-US investigation into the attack, the effect it had on victims' families and how it impacted Lockerbie's locals.",
      "Roger Park says the families \"made history\", by speaking out about flaws in the system.",
      "\"After their lobbying and campaigning, a lot of the protocols introduced in the aftermath of 9/11 were based on what they campaigned for,\" she says.",
      "Airlines also benefited from their experiences.",
      "\"A lot of Pan Am 103 family members trained airlines on how to deal with victims,\" she adds.",
      "Kathryn Turman, played in the series by Severance actress Merritt Wever, was head of the Office for Victims of Crime, for the US Department of Justice.",
      "Turman arranged travel for family members plus secure closed-circuit viewing in the US, for the trial of two bombing suspects in the Netherlands, in 2000. The FBI notes this was unprecedented at the time.",
      "Weipz adds: \"We have victim services in the FBI, in the Department of Justice, in the US Attorney's office. Why? Well, because of Kathryn, but also because of the Pan Am 103 families.\"",
      "Turman's character poignantly says in one of the episodes: \"The families should have been protected and prioritised from the start... we can't make that mistake again.\"",
      "The drama also highlights that lobbying by UK and US-based family groups resulted in \"key reforms, from strengthening travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening, to people-centred responses to major disasters\".",
      "For the series' lead writer Jonathan Lee, creating a factual drama 37 years later was also a way of exploring the human stories behind the horror.",
      "A co-production with Netflix, the show shines a light on \"the story of these small, but heroic acts of connective humanity, in the wake of this bomb that tried to blast things apart\", he says.",
      "For such a dark topic, it has some surprisingly uplifting moments.",
      "We witness the strength of bonds forged between people, in the wake of the bombing.",
      "\"Collaboration between families, countries and law enforcement agencies gets us from the worst of humanity to the best of it\", former lawyer Lee tells the BBC.",
      "\"We piece things together by working together.\"",
      "The series is something of a jigsaw - we see the police and FBI painstakingly process thousands of fragments of evidence, in the build-up to Abdulbaset Al Megrahi being convicted over the bombing in 2001.",
      "Two years later, Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi accepted his country's responsibility for the bombing, and paid compensation to the victims' families.",
      "The other pieces in the TV drama's puzzle focus on the lives of the people of Lockerbie and beyond, with volunteers stepping up to help traumatised families.",
      "Weipz recalled one scene in the drama, where her father tries to reach a financial settlement for his son's death with the Pan Am insurance panel.",
      "\"That was one of the worst days of my life... hearing your brother really had no value because he was 20 years old, and was an assistant manager at a swim club and mowed lawns...",
      "\"Watching it, you see how horrifying it was.\"",
      "We also see women from Lockerbie, who made endless cakes for the investigators, washed victims' clothes before they were returned to families and showed relatives the spot where their loved ones died.",
      "\"It was important to flesh out those emotional, human stories, to bring the Scottish stories to life,\" says Roger Park about the volunteers.",
      "\"They did such hard work and it wasn't their jobs, they were just locals who felt a moral obligation to help.",
      "\"Those women are just like my gran, I know those types of women, and I just think we rarely centre on those kinds of domestic stories.",
      "\"And what strong stuff you'd have to be made of to do what they did. I just love that they used the tools of their domestic lives to do such heroic work.\"",
      "New York-based Michelle Lipkin, whose father Frank Ciulla was killed on the flight, speaks fondly about \"the women who laundered the clothes\", including Ella Ramsden and Moira Shearer.",
      "\"My mother was close to Ella and Moira, and we see Moira when we go to Scotland,\" she says.",
      "\"There's no words to describe the gratitude we have for them, because our loved ones were murdered.",
      "\"It's the most evil of evil, and so every piece of clothing they laundered, every meal they made for the searchers - that just brought back what is possible, and the human spirit and kindness.\"",
      "Weipz also speaks about the \"compassion\" shown by the people of Lockerbie in the hours after the bombing.",
      "\"People slept outside with the bodies too. They didn't want them to be alone. It just overwhelms me at the times when I think about it,\" she says.",
      "Scottish actress Lauren Lyle plays June, the wife of Det Sgt Ed McCusker, one of the lead Scottish police officers.",
      "She says although the investigation was a \"male-heavy story because it was the 80s\", she also thinks \"the women just stepped right up\", often behind the scenes.",
      "Lyle spoke to the real-life Ed McCusker to research her role, and says: \"About five years ago, June got cancer, and she knew she was going to die. And she said to Eddie, 'One thing I want you to do is make sure you tell this story'.",
      "\"She sounded like a really formidable woman who held the family together, and I think she represents the people of Lockerbie.\"",

      "Speaking to BBC News, Vikander, 36, said she was \"thrilled\" to be returning to the stage, but added it was a \"daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult\".",
      "The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday.",
      "\"I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,\" Vikander said.",
      "\"Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden.",

      "\"Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother.",
      "\"So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories.\"",

    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday, life followed fiction when 133 cardinals began the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave takes place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican knew the outcome until a plume of white smoke curled from its chimney on Thursday, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church had a new leader. That man was Cardinal Robert Prevost, now known as Pope Leo XIV.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave operates, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "What is behind the new Pope's chosen name, Leo?",
      "Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?",
      "Pope Leo XIV marks new beginning for Catholic Church",
      "What Pope's speedy election says about Church's priorities",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants would have been \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the most recent election was one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote had been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis' appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This added a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision of who would succeed Pope Francis.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

      "Even with staff being brought in from other countries, official estimates show there were 131,000 vacancies in social care in England last year.",
      "Care companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.",
      "\"The sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies,\" said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.",
      "\"Taking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted - it's cruel,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",
      "Social care has been in crisis for years, with council funding of services squeezed, significant staff-shortages and growing demand from an ageing population. Plans for reform have been delayed time and again.",

      "There was a rapid rise in overseas recruitment \u2013 in 2022/23 80,000 people arrived in the UK to work in care and in 23/24, there were another 105,000 visas.",
      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",
      "In March 2024, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.",
      "In the year up to December 2024, 9,500 visas were granted to people entering the UK to provide \"caring personal services\", according to the government.",
      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care. There has been an ongoing government funded recruitment campaign and talk of the need to improve the pay and status of staff, but many workers fear solutions remain a long way off.",
      "The independent Casey Commission started work last month to draw up plans for adult social care. It has been described by ministers as a \"once in a generation opportunity to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of the sector\". Its first update is due next year and its final report by 2028.",
      "At a time when the NHS is struggling, social care is more important than ever as it can keep vulnerable people out of hospital and support patients when they return home.",
      "Many care workers will say it is an incredibly rewarding job and with overseas recruitment being closed, the question is what needs to change to encourage more UK people to take on the role?"

      "\"Many other surgeons who are writing articles will cite these articles and base their conclusions on these.",
      "\"Sometimes or often these papers are used when guidelines are formulated or referred to. So their conclusions can go on to influence many different things .\"",

      "None of them recognise the follow up form which he had claimed to have used in publications for up to five years post operative follow up.",

      "As an adult, Ms Nicklas said she advocated for her symptoms to be taken seriously, but as a teenager she said embarrassment about bodily functions had made that more difficult.",
      "\"Looking back now, why is that such an embarrassing thing?",
      "\"Why is going to the toilet so embarrassing when it's just a normal function that everybody does?",
      "\"Would my constipation have been better if I hadn't have refused to go to the toilet unless I was at home and my brothers weren't around and no one could hear me? Because that's not healthy decision making,\" she added.",

      "\"So if you are chronically constipated for many years you are far more likely to develop problems with a prolapse.\"",
      "The need for better understanding is part of the reason why Prof Cornish set up the Everywoman health festival in Cardiff, which is now in its third year.",

      "Ms Hassan said stigma was a huge factor, which could be worse in some cultures.",
      "\"We know that potentially one in three women will experience some urinary incontinence and potentially one in four women will experience some level of faecal incontinence throughout their life. That's huge numbers \u2013 it's really common.\"",
      "\"Education is key,\" said Prof Cornish.",
      "\"And the difficulty is that whilst there are some people who have that understanding or are able to access that education, you're essentially disenfranchising a large proportion of the population who may not be able to access it, and they may end up being the patients that I see more of.",
      "\"You see the inequalities that are out there.",
      "\"But all of this leads to a massive delay in treatment and usually an increase in the severity of symptoms and treatments needed.",
      "\"We all have a responsibility for our own health and that is going to be key \u2013 it's not just about off-loading it to the NHS, so I think the more we teach our children, that's going to empower them to take responsibility going forward.\"",

      "There was damage to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt,  the Metropolitan Police said.",
      "And just after 03:00 BST on Sunday, emergency services were called to a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington, a property that is also linked to Sir Keir.",
      "One person was assisted to safety via an internal staircase by crews wearing breathing apparatus, London Fire Brigade said.",
      "Police are also looking into a car fire as part of the probe.",
      "All three fires are being treated as suspicious and inquiries are ongoing.",
      "The prime minister - who lives at his official residence in Downing Street - is understood to still own the Kentish Town property which he lived at before the general election, but it has been rented out since then.",
      "Sir Keir has thanked the emergency services for their work, his official spokesman said.",
      "He added the matter was \"subject to a live investigation so I can't comment further\", and declined to provide any further details on who was in the property when the fire started.",
      "Police earlier said that counter-terrorism officers were leading the probe \"as a precaution and due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure\".",
      "On the Kentish Town property fire,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it had been called to a \"small fire\" at 01:11 BST on Monday that was under control about 20 minutes later.",
      "It said about 10 firefighters and two fire appliances from Kentish Town Fire Station attended the incident.",

      "\"The fire is being investigated and cordons remain in place while enquiries continue.\"",

      "At just after 03:00 on Sunday, firefighters were called to the Islington fire.",
      "The Kentish Town house has previously been targeted by protesters. Last year, three people were found guilty of public order offences after staging a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside it.",

    "summary": "The government says its proposals will reduce record levels of migration to the UK in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has unveiled Labour's long-awaited plans to cut levels of immigration into the UK.",
      "The prime minister said measures in the white paper, a blueprint for future laws, would make the system \"controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "Here is a summary of the key measures.",
      "Work visas tightened - for some",
      "Overseas workers will now generally need a degree-level qualification to apply for the main skilled worker visa, instead of the equivalent of A-level, reversing a change made under Boris Johnson's government.",
      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",
      "Lower qualification requirements will remain on a \"time limited basis\" for sectors deemed to be facing long-term recruitment issues.",
      "What this means in practice is not yet clear, with the government's migration advisory body tasked with recommending roles for inclusion.",
      "Lower-qualification visas will be capped and restricted to employers with a workforce training plan in place, whilst those applying will also face extra restrictions on bringing their dependants to the UK.",
      "But loosened for others",
      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",
      "It is not yet clear when this longer qualifying period will kick in - details of the new system, along with a similar scheme that will apply to applications for citizenship, will be consulted on later this year.",
      "Home Office urged to record migrant exits from UK",
      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Care visa scrapped",
      "A dedicated visa for social care workers introduced during the Covid pandemic will close to new applicants next month.",
      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",
      "Ministers are also thinking of charging English universities a new 6% tax on tuition fee income from international students, which they are promising to reinvest into the higher education and skills system.",
      "The government says it expects this to be passed on to international students in the form of higher fees, reducing applications by 7,000 per year.",
      "Refugee pilot extended",
      "A \"limited pool\" of people who lack refugee status in the UK but have been recognised as refugees by the United Nations will be allowed to use existing sponsored worker routes to come to the UK to work.",
      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",
      "The government says those extending visas will be required to demonstrate a higher level of English when applying to settle in the UK.",
      "Skills and training",
      "The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be \"expected to comply\" with strategies to boost workplace skills.",
      "These will also be determined by official migration advisers, but government sources say IT, construction and healthcare are likely to feature.",
      "Labour has previously indicated it wants to link skills training to the visa system - but details of what this means in practice have not yet been set out.",
      "Family rights reviewed",
      "The government says it will table legislation to \"clarify\" how the right to a family life in European human rights law should apply to immigration cases.",
      "It also says Parliament will be able to adopt a \"framework\" aiming to limit the extent to which family rights can be used to delay the removal of people without the right to stay in the UK.",
      "No overall cap",
      "The prime minister said the government wants to \"significantly\" reduce net migration - the number of people coming to the UK minus those leaving - from the record levels it has reached in recent years.",
      "But the prime minister is not putting a number on the overall level of net migration he wants to see \u2013 saying this approach has consistently failed in the past.",
      "Opposition parties have also declined to specify exactly what levels of migration they want to see each year.",
      "The Conservatives now say they would allow MPs to decide annual caps each year through a vote in Parliament.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has promised to overhaul a \"broken\" immigration system, with plans to tighten English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependants among the reforms being considered.",
      "Migrants will also have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years, under the plans.",
      "Labour's long-awaited migration rules, to be published soon, will \"create a system that is controlled, selective and fair,\" the prime minister said.",
      "Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the idea Sir Keir \"is tough on immigration is a joke\" and promised to push Parliament to introduce a cap on migration.",
      "Speaking before the publication of the Immigration White Paper, Sir Keir accused industries being \"almost addicted to importing cheap labour\" instead of \"investing in the skills of people here and want a good job in their community\".",
      "He singled out engineering as an industry \"where visas have rocketed while apprenticeships have plummeted\".",
      "The current system shuts out \"young people weighing up their future\" who missed out on potential training, Sir Keir said.",

      "What's likely to be in Labour's immigration crackdown?",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "Labour have signalled the plan to raise English language requirements across every immigration route into the UK, though have not set out full details.",
      "For the first time, adult dependants will also be required to show basic language skills to help them integrate, find jobs and avoid exploitation.",
      "The BBC has been told the changes are likely to require a change to primary legislation, delaying implementation until the next parliamentary session in 2026.",
      "In a speech, Sir Keir said: \"When people come to our country, they should also commit to integration and to learning our language.\"",
      "Critics have warned the rules may split families if partners or parents struggle to learn English.",
      "But research suggests that migrants themselves consider language important.",
      "In 2021, nine-out-of-ten migrants reported speaking English well, according to analysis by the Oxford University Migration Observatory.",
      "Only 1% of migrants self-reported not being able to speak English at all. But those with poor English skills were much less likely to be employed, the analysis found.",
      "The move is part of a wider effort to \"tighten up\" what the prime minister called a \"broken\" immigration system.",
      "The changes will also end automatic settlement for migrants on some visas in the UK after five years. Most migrants will need to stay at least 10 years before they can apply for settled status and begin the path to gaining full citizenship.",
      "At the same time, a \"fast-track\" settlement will be established for nurses, engineers, AI experts and others who \"genuinely contribute to Britain's growth and society\", Sir Keir said.",
      "With settled status, migrants can stay in the UK indefinitely, earn a living, study or get support. It can also be used to start the process to becoming a British citizen.",
      "A 10-year route to settlement would make the UK \"more restrictive than most other high-income countries,\" Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, told BBC News.",
      "The main impact of the change will be \"more visa-fee revenue to the Home Office\", because people on temporary visas pay ongoing fees to be here, Ms Sumption said.",
      "A longer settlement process will also make it \"harder for migrants to settle in, because more will lack the rights that come with permanent status\", she added.",
      "But Sir Keir described the plans as a \"clean break from the past\" that will \"ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned, not a right\".",
      "Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving.",
      "Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.",
      "The Immigration White Paper brings together months of research by officials and will lay out Labour's plan to get tougher on migration in the wake of big gains made by Reform UK in the local elections.",
      "The threshold for Skilled Worker Visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure - while the list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries will be narrowed.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper revealed on Sunday that Labour will change the rules to ensure care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas.",
      "Instead, firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country.",
      "Cooper told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg it is \"time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\".",
      "These two changes will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year, Cooper said.",
      "The Conservative Party said that - while it agrees with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - it would force a vote on a \"binding migration cap\".",
      "\"But Starmer and Labour will vote it down,\" Chris Philp predicted.",
      "He called Labour's plans \"too little\" and argued that if the government had stuck with Tory changes, net migration would have dropped \"by about 400,000\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said the immigration system was in \"tatters\" and trust had been \"shattered\".",
      "\"Labour must now focus on fixing our broken immigration system and the Liberal Democrats look forward to scrutinising the government's plans to ensure a system that works for our economy and our country,\" home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said.",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said that his party's strong performance in the local elections in England was due to public anger about both legal and illegal migration.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced sweeping reforms to immigration on Monday, including plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas.",
      "Even with staff being brought in from other countries, official estimates show there were 131,000 vacancies in social care in England last year.",
      "Care companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.",
      "\"The sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies,\" said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.",
      "\"Taking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted - it's cruel,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",
      "Social care has been in crisis for years, with council funding of services squeezed, significant staff-shortages and growing demand from an ageing population. Plans for reform have been delayed time and again.",
      "While care workers were clapped along with health workers during the pandemic, that did not translate into an improvement in pay or status.",
      "About 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce. It is often a minimum or just above minimum wage job, with little recognition of the increasing responsibility and complexity of the support staff provide to older and disabled people.",

      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Putting it bluntly, if someone can earn more working, for instance, in a supermarket for fewer, less strenuous hours, then that is the option many will chose.",
      "Post-Covid, some staff left care work because they felt burnt out while others who still loved the job felt they could not afford the increases in the cost of living.",
      "Between April 2021 and March 2022, social care vacancies reached a record high of 165,000, a 52% increase on the year before.",
      "By December 2021, the warnings of imminent collapse prompted Boris Johnson's Conservative government to make care work a shortage occupation, making it easier for companies to look overseas for staff.",
      "Recruits had to earn a minimum of \u00a320,480 a year to qualify for the visa, and they could bring family with them.",
      "There was a rapid rise in overseas recruitment \u2013 in 2022/23 80,000 people arrived in the UK to work in care and in 23/24, there were another 105,000 visas.",
      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",
      "In March 2024, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.",
      "In the year up to December 2024, 9,500 visas were granted to people entering the UK to provide \"caring personal services\", according to the government.",
      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care. There has been an ongoing government funded recruitment campaign and talk of the need to improve the pay and status of staff, but many workers fear solutions remain a long way off.",
      "The independent Casey Commission started work last month to draw up plans for adult social care. It has been described by ministers as a \"once in a generation opportunity to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of the sector\". Its first update is due next year and its final report by 2028.",
      "At a time when the NHS is struggling, social care is more important than ever as it can keep vulnerable people out of hospital and support patients when they return home.",
      "Many care workers will say it is an incredibly rewarding job and with overseas recruitment being closed, the question is what needs to change to encourage more UK people to take on the role?"

    "summary": "Troop numbers are down, morale is weak and some equipment is in a poor state - will the government's Strategic Defence Review be enough to turn that around?",
    "story": [
      "On a March day this year, a British nuclear-armed submarine quietly returned to its base on the west coast of Scotland after a record-breaking 204 days underwater. HMS Vanguard had 130 crew members on board. They had spent nearly seven months without fresh air or daylight, and with little communication.",
      "Patrols of the UK's nuclear-armed submarines are supposed to last no longer than three months. But the last eight patrols have all exceeded five months, as the navy's ageing fleet of submarines requires ever more time in maintenance. It means the submariners on board are spending longer and longer underwater.",
      "A submariner who was on board one of those long patrols described to me a worrying situation in which the crew ran low on food and medicines. Towards the end of the patrol he described how hungry crew members rummaged for tins of food in hidden compartments inside the submarine. He said they even had to make bread out of custard powder, because they'd run out of flour.",
      "The navy has long found it difficult to recruit sailors into its Submarine Service, often known as the \"Silent Service\".",
      "But the case of the 204-day patrol by HMS Vanguard raises a wider issue.",
      "Virtually everyone agrees that Britain's armed forces are depleted. Troop numbers are down, morale is weak, and some ageing equipment is in a poor state. And all this comes at a time of greater geopolitical uncertainty, as the threat from Russia looms large across Europe.",
      "Within the next few months, the government will publish its long-awaited Strategic Defence Review - a consultation launched by Sir Keir Starmer shortly after he arrived in Downing Street last summer, designed to identify threats to Britain and recommend how the armed forces can meet them. But there are already doubts over how much it can realistically achieve.",
      "So, as the world becomes more dangerous, what can the government do to reverse the decline - and restore the UK to military readiness?",
      "Dwindling troop numbers",
      "Politicians from all sides, along with military chiefs, admit Britain's armed forces have been \"hollowed out\". It's true for the Royal Navy and the RAF - and perhaps most acutely, in the British army.",
      "In 2010 the regular Army was nearly 110,000 strong. Now, it is struggling to meet its target of 73,000 soldiers - not enough to fill Cardiff's Principality Stadium.",
      "Earlier this year defence minister and former Royal Marine, Al Carns, told a conference at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank, that the entire British Army could be \"expended\" within six to 12 months if it fought a war on a similar scale to the Ukraine conflict.",
      "Last summer the head of the army, General Sir Roly Walker, said the Army needed to be ready to fight a war by 2027 - an admission it isn't ready to fight one in its current state. He said the Army needs to leverage technology, such as drones, new software, and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Justin Crump, an Army Reserve Officer who heads the risk and intelligence company Sibylline, argues that boosts to technology won't make up for the lack of military hardware.  \"We have big gaps and they're not going to get filled overnight,\" he says.",
      "The government is also promising to streamline the bureaucratic process of ordering new kit - trying to learn the painful lessons of past mistakes. By the time they eventually arrive, the delivery of hundreds of new Ajax armoured vehicles will have taken more than a decade.",
      "Weaknesses in its Nato commitments",
      "Speak to any government minister about security, they'll no doubt talk about Nato. It's the cornerstone of the UK's security, the government says, and one that has only become more important since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to its Nato commitments, the UK is supposed to be able to field tens of thousands of troops at short notice to defend any Nato territory \u2013 with a war-fighting division made up of tanks, artillery, and heavy armour.",
      "But a former senior General told the BBC that in a real war it would run out of ammunition, spares and supplies within weeks or even days. Nor does Britain have much in terms of ground-based air defences \u2013 not enough to protect key military bases in the UK, yet alone its towns and cities.",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Russia's next move? The countries trying to Putin-proof themselves",
      "Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground",
      "The weaknesses in Britain's contribution to Nato became starkly apparent in February this year, when a group of British MPs visited a Nato military site in Tapa, Estonia, where British soldiers are deployed (alongside Danish and French troops). The point of the base is to deter or slow down an invasion from Russia - which is just 80 miles away over a land border.",
      "Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat MP and former British Army Officer, said the Estonia visit was like going back in time, seeing the same equipment as when he first joined the Army as a reservist in 2004: ageing Challenger 2 tanks and Warrior armoured vehicles. What one former General described to me  as \"legacy kit from the 1980's\" - old and dwindling in numbers.",
      "About 1,000 British troops are stationed at the site. At the time of the MPs' visit they were armed with some drones - though not many. Nor did they have much in the way of systems to block or jam enemy drones, either. They also have a handful of long-range artillery guns - important for land warfare. The British Army currently has a total of just 14. Even tiny Estonia has double that number.",
      "Defence sources say that since the MPs' visit, the Army has now begun to test some of the new technology it wants to introduce. They say it \"will help soldiers see further, and strike faster\".",
      "Talk of thousands of British troops being sent to Ukraine for a lengthy deployment, if there were to be a ceasefire in its war with Russia, would present another huge challenge.",
      "In the recent past the British army has just about managed to sustain a prolonged military campaign. But in Afghanistan, between 2006 and 2014, it was only fighting lightly armed Taliban insurgents. Even then it was stretched - with nine thousand troops being constantly rotated every six months.",
      "Crump says \"Afghanistan was painful enough, and we had 20,000 more people\". While he says  providing a reassurance force for Ukraine \"might be doable \u2013 it would rapidly wear us down\".",
      "Questions over the price tag",
      "The government says it is addressing these challenges with its Strategic Defence Review. John Healey, the Defence Secretary, claims it will lead to the \"biggest shake up of UK defence for over 50 years\".",
      "But past reviews have rarely lived up to expectation \u2013 not least because the money available rarely matches ambitions. Most reviews are quickly overtaken by events. Harold Wilson's defence review of 1966 was overtaken just three years later by a crisis in Northern Ireland; whilst Tony Blair's review of 1998 came just three years before 9/11.",
      "Indeed, when work on this review began, the US - under President Joe Biden - was still the UK's closest and most reliable military partner. Now that's less clear.",
      "There are also questions over the price tag. The review's terms of reference assumes that defence spending will be capped at 2.5% of the UK's national income, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But few in defence believe that'll be enough.",
      "One of the independent experts leading the review, General Sir Richard Barrons, has already said the UK should be spending at least 3% of GDP on its armed forces. Meanwhile, Nato's Secretary General, Mark Rutte, is pressing allies to increase defence spending to \"north of 3%\". President Donald Trump has gone even higher, urging Nato countries to spend 5%.",
      "The government's \"ambition\" is to boost spending to 3% at some time in the next parliament - which will have the added bonus of boosting growth, ministers say. Just last week Sir Keir said that extra investment will create a \"defence dividend\" for jobs and prosperity.",
      "Others think the review is too narrow in focus. A former military chief told the BBC that a review should first identify threats to the UK, and then work out how to shape the Armed Forces. It was \"bonkers\", they added, to conduct a defence review without it being \"nested\" in a broader cross-government security review.",
      "An MoD spokesperson said that boosts to defence spending \"will make Britain stronger and safer in an insecure world and will help us build a modern and resilient Armed Forces, with cutting-edge capabilities\".",
      "The defence review, they added, is \"wide-ranging and working at pace, looking hard at the threats we face and all the capabilities we need to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century\".",
      "Low morale and cases of harassment",
      "Attempts to broaden the Army's appeal - including high-profile recruitment campaigns targeting the so-called \"snowflake\" generation - have not been enough to reverse the decline. Nor have a series of slick television adverts called \"Belonging\", which aim to highlight the camaraderie of life in the forces.",
      "Last year, the UK's armed forces were losing 300 more full-time personnel each month than they'd been recruiting.",
      "In a MoD survey last year nearly six in ten military personnel rated morale as low. Just four in 10 said they were satisfied with service life \u2013 the lowest since records began.",
      "This government is trying to boost morale by improving military accommodation, plus last year's pay rise of 6% for armed forces personnel was the largest in two decades.",
      "Part of the problem is a broader cultural one: fewer people have an emotional connection with the armed forces, Crump says. The average Briton is now more likely to know someone in jail than serving in the military, he adds.",
      "Last year, the Army apologised to Kerry-Ann Knight, a black female soldier who fronted Army recruitment campaigns, after she described years of racist abuse and bullying that made her life while serving a \"living hell\".",
      "High profile stories of bullying and sexual harassment within the military can't have helped - particularly for women and minorities.",
      "The MoD has set a recruiting goal of 30% women by 2030, but they currently make up less than 12% of the regular armed forces - a figure which has hardly shifted in a decade.",
      "Britain is not alone in struggling to fill its ranks. It's a problem experienced by many western nations relying on volunteers. Some governments have now introduced some form of conscription. In March, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a plan to make all Polish men undergo compulsory military training.",
      "But there appears to be little appetite for conscription among the British public. A YouGov poll in September 2023 found that just 28% of the British public would support a one year military service. Younger people were particularly opposed.",
      "The government wants to get people interested from a young age, by expanding cadet forces in secondary schools. The MoD is also trying to keep better records of those troops who have left, and who could be recalled in a crisis.",
      "An MoD spokesperson said: \"We are committed to fixing Armed Forces recruitment and have already given personnel the largest pay rise in decades, scrapped 100 outdated recruitment policies, and passed legislation through the Commons to introduce a new Armed Forces Commissioner to improve service life.\"",
      "AI on the battlefield?",
      "Whatever comes out of the defence review, there is no expectation that troop numbers will increase in the near future.",
      "Analysts are, however, looking at radical solutions - including the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the battlefield. The most obvious example is AI-enabled drones, which are already being used in Ukraine to identify targets on their own, to deadly effect. But some also envisage a future in which machines could collect data on adversaries.",
      "A large land war in Europe is now focusing minds. Senior British military officers, as well as politicians, have repeatedly stated the UK 's armed forces must be ready to fight. But there still appears to be a temptation to use their power and influence much further away from home.",
      "Last month, HMS Prince of Wales - one of the Navy's two aircraft carriers \u2013 left Portsmouth on an eight-month voyage to the other side of the world. It's the biggest UK defence endeavour this year, involving nearly 4,000 personnel, along with the support of allies, sailing to the Pacific and back.",
      "Healey says it will demonstrate the UK's ability to deploy a major military force around the world, while at the same time promoting British trade.",
      "Emma Salisbury, a fellow at the Council on Geostrategy, a think tank, says the carrier's Pacific deployment holds a powerful symbolic importance. \"It's a message not just of deterrence against Russia, but also against China,\" she says. \"In the world as it is now, we can't look at things geographically. Everything is interconnected. It's linking together our alliances and partnerships on a global scale.\"",
      "But the deployment also highlights the challenges of trying to do more with less. Britain can only afford to have an episodic appearance in the Indo-Pacific. And the Trump administration has warned UK and other European allies to focus on their own doorstep, rather than faraway adventures. The carrier deployment is another strain on finite resources.",
      "Of course, ministers maintain that their soon-to-be published defence review really could reset the dial and restore the UK to military readiness. But so far no government has really been willing to tackle the greatest dilemma for UK defence: do less or spend a lot more.",

    "story": [
      "Care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, the home secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Yvette Cooper said it is \"time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\" and rules will change this year - instead requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country.",
      "The government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws on Monday in a bid to cut net migration, and says measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year.",
      "Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plans were \"too little\" and called for an annual cap on migration.",
      "Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving.",
      "Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.",
      "The Home Office has not yet officially confirmed what will be in its immigration White Paper, due early next week.",
      "Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cooper said the government \"was setting up plans for a substantial reduction in net migration\" but added targets would not be set, saying \"they undermined the credibility of anything that governments do\".",
      "The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure.",
      "There will also be a \"narrower\" list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries, Cooper said, but did not give examples.",
      "Currently, roles considered to be in short supply in the UK like carpenters, graphic designers and pharmaceutical technicians can be placed on the Immigration Salary List (ISL), allowing employers to hire overseas workers at discount - set at 80% of the market rate.",
      "Cooper said the government expects those changes will \"lead to a reduction of up to 50,000 fewer lower skilled visas over the course of the next year\".",
      "As well as visa changes, the home secretary added there would be new requirements for training commitments \"to get people who are not working back into the labour market here in the UK\".",
      "Philp - who said he agreed with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - told the same programme the Conservatives would push Parliament to vote on a yearly migration cap this week.",
      "When asked what the cap would be, he said \"we're working on the detail to specify that number\", but it would be \"a further reduction of significantly more than 50,000\".",
      "He argued that if Labour had stuck with Tory changes net migration would have dropped \"by about 400,000\".",
      "Cooper also said there would be \"some changes\" to rules around international students and graduates.",
      "\"We will let them continue to come and to stay and to work afterwards,\" she added.",
      "\"We are making some changes, particularly around the standards and the compliance for universities, because, again, we've had problems where some universities haven't had proper standards in place.",
      "\"They've recruited people to come as international students who then haven't completed their courses, have either overstayed or... other problems with compliance of the system.\"",
      "The government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last July.",
      "Applications for Health and Care Worker visas peaked at 18,300 in August 2023, then collapsed to 1,700 by April this year following the ban on bringing dependants.",
      "And on 9 April, an additional restriction was added requiring care firms who want to recruit a new worker from overseas to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within England first.",
      "But the new rules will require care companies to recruit from domestic workers or a pool of over 10,000 care workers brought to the UK on visas for jobs that never materialised.",
      "Alongside this Cooper promised \"to bring in a new fair pay agreement for care workers\" to make care jobs more attractive to UK workers and reduce overseas demand.",
      "Nadra Ahmed, the National Care Association's executive chairman, told the BBC the changes would a \"challenging scenario\" for care homes even \"worse\".",
      "She said providers \"always prefer to have a domestic workforce\" but said it was not available.",

      "The government's efforts to fix the prison crisis may not work without \"bold investment decisions\", the leading union for the probation service has said.",
      "Ian Lawrence, general secretary of Napo, said a review of sentencing policy by former Conservative Justice Secretary David Gauke \"may come to little effect\" if the probation service was underfunded.",
      "The union boss said he supported proposals to scrap short sentences for some offenders and toughen up community orders supervised by probation officers.",
      "But he said probation staff were already \"overworked\" and suggested any \"cost cutting\" could increase pressure on the service.",

      "\"We are hiring 1,300 new probation officers, investing in technology to cut back on admin, and increasing focus on those offenders who pose the greatest risk to the public,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"This will ease pressure on the service, help cut reoffending and keep our streets safe.\"",
      "Gauke is understood to be considering recommending the idea of scrapping short prison terms as part of the sentencing review.",
      "The review comes as prisons across the country are struggling to deal with overcrowding after the number of offenders behind bars hit a new high.",
      "In an interim report, Gauke warned that unless radical changes were made, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells by early next year.",
      "Gauke's sentencing review is expected to be published this month, before the government sets out its spending plans for departments in June.",
      "\"Napo would welcome any initiatives to reduce the numbers of people in our prison estate,\" Lawrence said.",
      "\"But that can't come without the lord chancellor absolutely recognising the pressures that the probation service is now facing and will in the future.",
      "\"And that's why we need brave, bold investment decisions by this government and not more of the same.\"",
      "Tight budget",
      "The prisons and probation budget fell by 12% when inflation was accounted for between 2007\u201308 and 2023\u201324, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has outlined plans for efficiency savings and in her spring statement, said day-to-day government spending would fall by \u00a36.1bn per year by 2030.",
      "But the chancellor has not yet stated which departments will have less money to spend, meaning it's not clear how the probation service will be affected.",
      "The money allocated to government departments for the three years beyond 2025-26 will be set out in the spending review in June.",
      "Lawrence said a reduction in funding for the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the probation service, could mean less funding to support offenders in the community and worse outcomes.",
      "\"In other words, they go out of prison and they've got no option but to commit crime because they have no means of supporting themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"They're back in prison within weeks. And so it goes on and that costs the taxpayer millions.\"",
      "A source at the Prison Reform Trust, a charity, said the probation service would need to be resourced properly if there was more community sentencing.",

      "Lawrence said Napo was in dispute with the prison and probation service over pay progression and workloads.",
      "He said the union had submitted a claim for a 12% pay rise for probation staff this year.",
      "That's way above the increases independent pay review bodies have advised the government to give teachers (4%) and NHS workers (3%).",

      "Urban economist Paul Swinney told peers that pub spending data suggested that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday.",
      "But a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, he added, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend.",
      "He also added that a decline in city-centre spending had not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centres.",

      "\"It appeared from the data that we have that the post-work drink has reduced in those other places.",

      "\"That might have happened a little bit, but certainly not to the extent that people were suggesting [during the pandemic],\" he told the committee.",
      "He added that suburban supermarkets had \"probably been the biggest winner\" from the shift in spending patterns since Covid.",
      "He said more flexible working patterns had led to some immediate benefits for workers, including reduced travel cost and more flexibility.",
      "But he added it could be \"two, three, ten years down the line\" before the long-term impact on economic productivity could be properly assessed.",

      "The Home Office has an optional break clause next year in the contracts with the three companies, but it's understood these will not be triggered.",

    "story": [
      "When it comes to reducing UK immigration, there have been plenty of promises and targets from successive governments over the last 15 years, but the numbers remain high.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer is now pledging to \"take back control of our borders\", promising tighter rules to bring down the numbers \"significantly\".",
      "BBC Verify examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead.",
      "What's happened to the numbers?",
      "Migration levels have hit \"unprecedented levels\" in recent years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",
      "Annual net migration is expected to come down to about 315,000 by the end of the Parliament.",
      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",
      "Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers.",

      "Starmer promises to cut migration as Farage and Badenoch criticise PM's plan",
      "Proposals will lead to significant immigration cut, vows PM",
      "Amy Clark, commercial director of a Cornwall care home chain, told the BBC that the measures could cause challenges because \"recruiting locally is very, very difficult\".",
      "The government could increase the levels of pay in social care, but that would leave them under pressure to increase grants to local authorities and potentially raise taxes to fund it.",
      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",
      "As an example, Sir Keir said the number of engineering apprenticeships had fallen in recent years, while visas for overseas workers in this area had gone up.",
      "Figures in the government's new immigration plan show that the number of UK work visas issued for engineering professionals rose from 3,427 in 2021 to 5,495 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the number of new apprenticeships in engineering in England fell from 26,970 in 2021-22 to 18,520 in 2024-25.",
      "But if the government wants many more home-trained engineers that will likely come with a cost in terms of a higher training budget.",
      "While that investment could come partly from firms, it could also mean more public spending and possibly tax rises.",
      "According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total public spending on adult education and skills has fallen by 24% in real terms since 2010.",
      "Reacting to the government's proposals, Make UK - which represents manufacturers - said firms are being forced to recruit overseas staff because domestic skills training is \"fundamentally flawed\".",

    "story": [
      "The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries.",
      "President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US.",
      "But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium.",
      "Here's an at-a-glance look at what's in the deal.",
      "This isn't a trade deal",
      "Trump declared on social media this announcement would be a \"major trade deal\" - it's not.",
      "He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress.",
      "Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on some of Trump's tariffs.",
      "This is an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods.",
      "It is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement, there will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.",
      "Car tariffs cut to 10%",
      "Trump had placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US on top of the existing 2.5%.",
      "This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year.",
      "But any cars exported above that quota will be subject to a 27.5% import tax.",
      "Cars are the UK's biggest export to the US - worth about \u00a39bn last year.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover, which exports almost a quarter of its cars to the US,  said the deal \"secures greater certainty for our sector\".",
      "But car industry leaders have told the BBC the quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively.",
      "The UK currently imposes a 10% levy on US car imports, but it is not clear if there is any change to this.",
      "The US has previously demanded the tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves had indicated she is open to such a cut.",
      "Trump also announced that Rolls-Royce engines and plane parts will be able to be exported from the UK to the US tariff-free.",
      "No tariffs on steel and aluminium",
      "A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US that came into effect in March has been scrapped.",
      "This is good news for firms such as British Steel which was brought under government control as it struggled to stay operational.",
      "However, the White House said it would impose a quota on the \"most favoured nation rates for UK steel and aluminium and certain derivative steel and aluminium products.\"",
      "It is currently unclear how much of these products the UK will be able to export to the US under this quota system without paying more.",
      "It is also unclear whether the scrapping of tariffs will apply to steel derivative products and whether only steel melted and poured in the UK will benefit.",
      "The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, about \u00a3700m in total.",
      "However, the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, including things such as gym equipment, furniture and machinery.",
      "These are worth much more, about \u00a32.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year.",
      "Industry body Steel UK said there were \"a number hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal\".",
      "It said firms needed to know what supply chain conditions need to be met, what the quotas are and when they take effect.",
      "Pharmaceuticals still the big unknown",
      "What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The US said both countries would \"promptly negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals\".",

    "story": [
      "You have to go back more than 100 years, to before 1922, for an election where Labour was not dominating Welsh politics.",
      "Rooted in the industrial heritage of the country which was once the home of the UK's first Labour MP, Keir Hardie, the party has beat all others in Wales in every major Westminster election ever since.",
      "Labour has always been the largest party in Cardiff Bay too, and has won every election for the Welsh Parliament.",
      "But for the first time, the outlook for Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election on May 7 2026 is much less clear.",
      "Led by Eluned Morgan, it faces a fight to hold on to the reins of the Welsh government, and the sway it has held over Welsh politics.",
      "How do you vote in the Senedd election?",
      "What's your Senedd constituency?",
      "What does the Senedd do?",
      "Polls have shown Labour neck and neck with two parties - the pro-independence Plaid Cymru, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "But a survey published this week suggested Plaid Cymru was pulling ahead, with Labour falling behind Farage.",
      "Both Plaid and Reform are hoping they can leapfrog Labour and become the largest group in the Senedd, as are the Welsh Conservatives, who are polling behind the other three.",
      "A new voting system means the next Senedd could be split between about four parties of a similar size, raising questions about exactly how the next Welsh government could be brought together.",
      "A senior Tory has said a coalition in the next parliament is \"nailed on\", and there is talk among some about whether parties would need to share the top job of first minister.",
      "The Welsh Parliament, or Senedd Cymru, is what we now call the institution set up as the National Assembly in 1999.",
      "Whoever can command control of the parliament forms the Welsh government - the ministers which run the services Westminster decided to hand over to Cardiff Bay, including the NHS.",
      "While it has never won a majority, Labour has led every single government since 1999, with the assistance of Plaid and the Lib Dems.",
      "The potential for a shake-up in the Senedd is partly down to plans to expand the number of politicians there from 60 to 96 - the brainchild of former First Minister Mark Drakeford and former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.",
      "As well as more politicians, the new parliament is likely to better reflect the proportion of votes won by each party - more so than the mixed system used up until now.",
      "This is important when it is considered against polls that suggest Welsh voters are divided.",
      "Two recent ones - from Survation and Beaufort Research - have put Labour ahead of Plaid and Reform but only just.",
      "But a poll by ITV Wales and Cardiff University conducted in late April placed Plaid on 30%, with Reform behind on 25% and Labour on 18% - a historic low. The Conservatives were placed at 13%, the Lib Dems 7% and the Greens 5%.",
      "All recent polling for Labour on Senedd voting intention is lower than how the party performed at the last general election, where it got 37% of the vote.",
      "Cardiff University politics expert Prof Richard Wyn Jones said the previous mixed proportional and first-past-the-post system helped Labour win around 50% of the seats in Wales with \"a third of the vote\".",
      "He said elections in both Wales and Scotland next year will be the \"most high-profile test for the Starmer administration\".",
      "\"It would be utterly seismic if they are not the largest party in Wales,\" he told BBC Wales.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones spoke before Tuesday's poll was published - as did everyone else in this article. He said Labour's chances of coming first should not be written off.",
      "\"But even if Labour is only barely ahead, that would be seismic because it would mean the Labour group in the Senedd is essentially not much bigger than the current Labour group in the Senedd, and the Senedd would be 36 seats bigger,\" he said.",
      "So, what could be behind it all?",
      "The post-pandemic period has been tough for Welsh Labour \u2013 plunged into crisis over the donation of \u00a3200,000 from a man convicted of illegally dumping waste to its now-former leader, Vaughan Gething.",
      "The row exposed splits within the Labour group of 30 MSs. Despite Welsh Labour having a landslide general election result, several Welsh ministers resigned to force Gething's ouster, prompting the rise of Morgan as first minister.",
      "Even before Drakeford decided to step down in late 2023, triggering the leadership contest that Gething won, Labour MSs had been arguing over transport policies, including the default 20mph speed limit, while the government has been struggling with long waits in the Welsh NHS.",
      "Former Labour special advisor turned lobbyist Cathy Owens, of Cavendish Cymru, partly blamed the leadership crisis and factors at a UK level.",

      "NHS waits and the controversial 20mph speed limit were always among the top three issues relayed on the doorstep at the general election, according to a well-connected Welsh Labour activist.",
      "They said a mix of Welsh and UK issues were at play, but argued that the Welsh government \"got complacent\".",
      "The activist blamed the \"way\" the 20mph speed limit was delivered - \"it told voters we weren't listening to them and we were essentially lecturing them\".",
      "\"I agree with the desired outcomes of the policy, but you can't treat voters like that,\" they said.",
      "Alun Davies, Labour Blaenau Gwent MS, acknowledged the public was \"frustrated with politics\" but said: \"Labour remains the party that probably most people in Wales feel represents their own values.\"",
      "The politician, who is involved in the production of the party's manifesto, said: \"Eluned has got the power to transform Welsh Labour's fortunes during an election campaign.",

      "For the second thing, Ms Owens said Morgan needed help from her party colleagues in the UK government - \"some funding, or some extra investment\" over and above what is automatically provided through the existing Barnett formula system, which is largely based on population.",
      "\"Now, that is proving more of a sticky wicket,\" she said. \"There has been no evidence of a win so far on that\".",
      "The relationship between Welsh and Westminster Labour has become a big part of the story of Morgan's time as Welsh Labour leader.",
      "She has been increasingly keen to distance herself from Sir Kier Starmer - on Tuesday she gave a speech where she was willing to call out his government, should it take decisions that \"harm\" Welsh communities.",
      "'The polls tell a good story'",
      "One party hoping to benefit from the turn in Labour's fortunes is Plaid Cymru.",
      "The left-leaning party has long struggled to beat its strong showing in the first assembly election of 1999 when it won almost 29% of the vote, but the splintering of British politics has presented Plaid with an opportunity.",
      "Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has been presenting himself as a first minister in waiting, while the party has published plans on health and the economy it said it would enact if it formed the next Welsh government.",
      "Unlike their political cousins in Scotland, the SNP, Plaid has never won a Welsh election and came third last time round.",
      "It took part in a short-lived coalition with Labour between 2007 and 2011, and helped Labour govern more recently in the form of the co-operation deal which ended in summer 2024.",
      "\"We're not getting too carried away with the polls,\" Plaid's Senedd party chairman Llyr Gruffydd said. \"But the polls do tell a good story for us.\"",
      "\"We will clearly be highlighting the need for change. It's a tired government.\"",
      "He said the party will face a challenge in helping \"people realise that this is a different electoral system. Every single vote counts - there will not be a wasted vote\".",
      "It was put to Gruffydd that it was difficult for Plaid to be seen as anti-establishment when it had been involved in helping Labour govern. \"We won't shy away from the fact that we've been punching above our weight... and still achieving elements of our manifesto,\" he said. \"Imagine what we could do if we were in government.\"",
      "'There's so much frustration'",
      "One party hoping to make their big entrance into Welsh politics is Farage's Reform UK.",
      "The party has polled closely to Labour and Plaid Cymru and came second in 13 seats at the last general election. While it has five MPs in England, and some councillors in Wales, it has no-one at Senedd at present.",
      "It is celebrating its recent English local election successes, where it made big gains, won control of 10 councils, two mayors and a by-election from Labour.",
      "Pointing to who the party is in Wales is difficult - it is yet to decide who will stand for them at the next election, or who might act as a figurehead.",
      "They are not starting from scratch - Farage's previous party UKIP had a short-lived stint in the Senedd after it won seven AMs in 2017.",
      "At least one of their former AMs is hoping to become a Reform MS - Caroline Jones. She is hoping to stand for Reform in the seat of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg - which covers Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",
      "Who could work with who?",
      "It is early days, but the prospect of the electorate being split four ways or more raises questions about how the next government could be formed.",
      "Politicians can be reluctant to talk about the topic with 12 months to go, but for Labour, you would assume a deal with the Conservatives or Reform would be unthinkable. Ministers have instead worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems in the past.",
      "Plaid have ruled out working with Reform, but not Labour or the Tories.",
      "The Conservative's Kurtz declined to talk about who the party might work with, but said the likelihood of a coalition is \"nailed on - it'll have to be a coalition. No one party will reach the threshold of governing on their own\".",
      "Plaid's Gruffydd said a rotating first ministership - similar to how the coalition running the Irish government has operated with rotating prime ministers - \"could be on the agenda\".",
      "\"It depends on the arithmetic,\" he said, suggesting it could be discussed if there are \"two parties thoroughly at the same kind of level\".",

    "summary": "It suggests the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 04:54:59 GMT",
    "summary": "A powerful prime minister tries and fails to stop an Old Labour stalwart's progress to City Hall.",
    "story": [
      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",
      "However, Livingstone's ability to alienate prime ministers wasn't confined to Conservatives.",
      "Tony Blair was also not a Ken fan.",
      "\"Red\" Ken, as he was known, was Old Labour, not New Labour.",
      "The message from Downing St was clear: Stop Ken.",
      "The party management tried to get the very popular Mo Mowlam to stand, then switched to Frank Dobson.",
      "A bearded, avuncular figure who was serving as New Labour's first health secretary, he was 'persuaded' to stand against his old comrade Ken.",
      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",
      "Livingstone was his party's standard bearer again in both 2008 and 2012, on both occasions losing to a young Conservative contender called Boris Johnson.",

    "summary": "Researchers in the US and Japan are racing to build new particle detectors that they hope will explain why the Universe exists.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of south Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does the Universe exist?",
      "They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists \u2013 who are several years ahead.",
      "The current theories of astronomy can't explain why the planets, stars and galaxies came into existence. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.",
      "US scientists are hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).",
      "The scientists travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison.",
      "Dune's science director Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as \"cathedrals to science\".",
      "Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.",
      "\"We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of 1,500 scientists who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,\" he says.",
      "When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter \u2013 from which stars, planets and everything around us are made \u2013 and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.",
      "Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we \u2013 as matter \u2013 are.",
      "Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won \u2013\u00a0and we exist \u2013 lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.",
      "They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.",
      "This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.",
      "The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.",
      "Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be \"transformative\" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.",
      "\"It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,\" she said.",
      "Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. In all their splendour, look like a temple to science. The scientists are building Hyper K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super K.",
      "The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than two years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.",
      "\"We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,\" he says.",
      "Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, \"I would like to get there first!\"",
      "But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the US project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.",
      "\"There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently\".",
      "The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery \u2013 for now."

      "In Cardiff, where the council spends more than \u00a37m a year on street cleaning, the worst performing \"D\" streets were found in some of the city's most deprived neighbourhoods, including Ely, Roath, Grangetown and Splott.",

      "\"The seagulls are getting savvy - if there's any food elements in any of the bags they're there in seconds - they will have it, they will shred it and strew it across the streets,\" she said.",
      "\"If everyone uses the right caddies and bags then that's one step towards keeping the streets cleaner.\"",

      "\"People who've lived here all their lives and they've said to me lately that they're distressed by the amount of litter on the streets,\" she added.",
      "She urged people to \"be proactive and help each other out\" by joining litter picks, and reporting dumped waste to the council.",
      "The illegal dumping of waste, known as fly-tipping, is also an issue in the area.",
      "\"[This] is obviously an illegal fly-tip of what looks like domestic waste,\" explained Gareth Davies from Keep Wales Tidy, in reference to a large pile of rubbish in a gully between the housing estate and a main road.",
      "\"Often this isn't local residents, but rather people fly-tipping in other people's communities,\" he said.",
      "\"This has a huge impact - there's the mental health side of seeing litter every day as you walk in and out of the estate.",
      "\"But also things like the smell on a hot day, rats making home in your garden, even coming into your house.\"",
      "'Selfish people'",
      "Cardiff councillor Norma Mackie, cabinet member for waste, said \"littering, whether dropped on the ground or thrown from vehicles, is caused by a few selfish people\".",
      "\"If litterers used the litter bins provided on the street, or disposed of rubbish at home after their journey, then the money which is currently being spent on this problem could be used for other services,\" she said.",

      "In the popular seaside resort of Barry Island, dealing with litter is an \"industrial exercise\", according to the leader of Vale of Glamorgan council Lis Burnett.",
      "The council deals with more than 250 tonnes of litter a year across Barry's beaches, costing around \u00a3800,000.",
      "\"Trying to find the money we need to provide these litter services is a real difficulty - we're all struggling with it,\" said Ms Burnett, who also represents the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA).",
      "The need for increased funding for education and social care had meant other budgets were being squeezed, she warned.",
      "\"It's a huge issue for every single local authority in Wales,\" she added.",
      "Both the WLGA and Keep Wales Tidy have urged the Welsh government to move ahead with delayed plans to force packaging producers to pay towards the costs of clearing litter.",
      "A long-awaited deposit return scheme for bottles and cans has also been held up following disagreements with the UK government over Wales' decision to include glass.",
      "Owen Derbyshire, Keep Wales Tidy's chief executive officer, said the Welsh government was \"taking important steps\" but needed a long-term plan for reducing street litter.",
      "\"This is a rising tide that we are really struggling to stop at the moment,\" he said, adding that huge increases in on-the-go food and drinks packaging were \"driving quite scary behaviours\".",
      "The charity wants mass public education campaigns, stronger enforcement of litter laws and \"a move away from single-use culture\".",
      "But Mr Derbyshire said this was not just a matter for the government or councils.",
      "\"Citizens, businesses, councils, and charities [should come] together to take shared responsibility for this growing problem,\" he said.",
      "The Welsh government said: \"Tackling litter and local environment issues is key and that is why we have provided Keep Wales Tidy with further funding to co-ordinate volunteer clean-up activities, monitor litter levels and deliver positive behaviour change campaigns right across the country.\"",

      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",

    "story": [
      "About 1.2m people in the UK were affected by banking outages that happened on what was pay day for many earlier this year.",
      "The details have emerged in letters from Lloyds, TSB, Nationwide and HSBC to Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, which is looking into the incident that occurred on Friday, 28 February.",
      "HSBC also revealed that customers had to wait two hours on average that day to reach its online customer service team. Its standard target wait time is five minutes.",
      "In their correspondence, the banks said they had paid compensation to affected customers and also outlined what they were doing to try to prevent similar problems in the future.",
      "Pay day problems",
      "Lloyds Banking Group customers faced the biggest impact from the February outages.",
      "Ron van Kemenade, the bank's group chief operating officer, said around 700,000 people who are customers of Lloyds, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and MBNA were affected as they couldn't log into their accounts on a first attempt.",
      "However Mr van Kemenade argued it did not amount to an outage, as there were five million successful logins during the period of disruption.",
      "Nonetheless, the bank said it was improving its log-in infrastructure and monitoring systems following the incident.",
      "The letters from the banks revealed about 250,000 TSB customers, 196,255 from Nationwide and 60,000 from HSBC also faced disruption on that morning.",
      "The banks have paid out over \u00a3114,000 in compensation to customers so far, with Nationwide (\u00a384,341) paying the most.",
      "All the banks said there was no evidence of an increase in fraudulent activity during the disruption, and said there was also no indication that outages were more prevalent at some times - such as pay days - than at other periods.",
      "Fine and failing infrastructure",
      "The pay day outage was far from the only IT problem the banking sector has experienced.",
      "In March, it emerged that nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years.",

      "The report also said Barclays could now face compensation payments of \u00a312.5m following an outage there that affected customers on pay day in January.",
      "Experts including Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, and Shilpa Doreswamy, a director with GFT, a company committed to the digital transformation of the financial sector, have stated that the recent outages reveal the problems banks have with ageing infrastructure and failing IT systems.",
      "Ms Doreswamy told the BBC on Thursday that payday outages were \"not just a case of unfortunate timing\" but also predictable, preventable events.",
      "\"They've highlighted the need for banks to invest in IT modernisation to prevent the eroding of customer trust,\" she said.",
      "Not acting to reduce the possibility of downtime or frustration for customers - particularly during high-demand periods - could potentially see banks risk their reputation and losing customers, Ms Doreswamy added.",

      "Those designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe.",

      "If that happened, the consequences for the army of volunteers who write and edit articles could be serious and would reach beyond the UK, the Foundation argues.",
      "It has singled out additional duties which could, in effect, require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers - something it fears could expose them to data breaches, stalking, vexatious lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes.",
      "\"We would be forced to collect data about our contributors, and that would compromise their privacy and safety, and what that means is that people would feel less safe as contributors\", Rebecca MacKinnon the Wikimedia Foundation's vice president of global advocacy told the BBC",
      "\"We've seen in other parts of the world, when people do not feel safe contributing to Wikipedia, then they shy away from controversial topics that may be challenging to to people who are powerful, and that reduces the quality and the usefulness of the encyclopaedia\".",
      "'Outlier' services",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation stresses it is not trying to challenge the OSA in general, or the idea that there should be Category 1 services subject to additional duties.",
      "Instead, it is challenging parts of the so-called \"Categorisation Regulations\" that set out how the regulator Ofcom will decide which sites will have to follow the most stringent duties.",
      "It argues, as currently defined, they risk not only inappropriately catching sites such as Wikipedia but also missing some platforms which should be abiding by tougher rules.",
      "\"The Regulations do not just risk overregulating low risk \"outlier\" services, like Wikipedia,\" Phil Bradley-Schmieg wrote in a blog post.",
      "\"As designed, the regulations will also fail to catch many of the services UK society is actually concerned about, like misogynistic hate websites\".",
      "The foundation argues its volunteers already do an effective job of keeping harmful content off the platform.",
      "After the 2024 Southport murders, volunteers worked night and day to provide reliable and neutral information Mr Bradley-Schmieg wrote.",

      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.",
      "That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store.",
      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\"",
      "\"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote.",
      "Case origins",
      "Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games.",
      "In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases.",
      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",
      "Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game.",
      "The move led to the current court battle between the two companies.",

      "In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",

      "For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word.",
      "\"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

    "story": [
      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",
      "The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.",

      "Prosecutors' first witness, a former security guard named Israel Florez, worked at the hotel, the site of a surveillance video showing Mr Combs attacking his ex-girlfriend. The clip, which CNN released last year, was played for jurors on Monday.",
      "Mr Florez told jurors that morning on 5 March 2016 at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles he received a call about a \"woman in distress\" on the sixth floor.",
      "He said he found Mr Combs there in a towel, slouched on a chair with a \"devilish\" look on his face, and a broken vase on the floor. Ms Ventura sat cowering in the corner with her face covered, Mr Florez said.",
      "Mr Florez told prosecutors that Ms Ventura kept saying she wanted to leave, but Mr Combs told her she could not.",
      "He testified that Ms Ventura had a purple eye, but did not want to call police and she eventually left in a black SUV.",
      "Mr Florez alleged that later, to \"make it go away\", Mr Combs tried to hand him a wad of cash, but he declined.",
      "Attorneys for Mr Combs tried to poke holes in Mr Florez's claims, asking why he did not include certain details - like Ms Ventura's purple eye  - in an incident report he filed afterwards.",
      "His testimony was followed by Daniel Phillip, a former manager of male strippers, who said he met Mr Combs and Ms Ventura after his boss asked him to fill in as a stripper for a bachelorette party.",
      "But, Mr Phillip said, he was greeted at a hotel instead by Ms Ventura, who told him it was her birthday and her husband wanted to give her a gift.",
      "Mr Phillip told the court he would go on to have sex with Ms Ventura on several occasions - encounters that lasted as long as 10 hours, sometimes under the influence of drugs - as Mr Combs watched and filmed.",
      "He alleged that he witnessed Mr Combs attack Ms Ventura at least twice, including one time when he dragged her by her hair as she screamed \"I'm sorry\".",
      "Mr Combs then came back in the room with Ms Ventura and asked the two to have sex again in front of him, Mr Phillip said.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" he said. \"It came out of nowhere. I was terrified.\"",
      "Mr Phillip claimed on the stand that he did not call the police for fear that Mr Combs was \"someone with unlimited power\" and that he could \"lose his life\" for reporting it.",
      "The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday when Ms Ventura is expected to testify.",
      "At the crowded courthouse on Monday, Mr Combs' children - including his daughters - were seen holding hands. His mother also was photographed walking out of court along with his publicist."

      "The reality TV star and business woman, 44, is expected to take the stand in the afternoon to give her version of events of the burglary, which saw her tied up and held at gunpoint in a luxury suite where she was staying during Paris Fashion Week.",

      "Ten people are on trial, which began last month.",
      "On Monday, witness Abderrahmane Ouatiki, the night receptionist who says he was marched up to Kardashian's hotel suite and made to translate the burglars' demands, said the American star was \"completely hysterical\" and \"in a state of complete terror\" as a \"very nervous\" man pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"He was very aggressive and she was utterly terrified,\" said Ouatiki.",
      "He added he too had feared for his life as the burglar was acting erratic and was clearly irritated by Kardashian's screaming.",
      "Three people reportedly kept watch in the reception of the exclusive Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s in central Paris while two other men forced Ouatiki to take them to Kardashian's suite, where they demanded she give him the ring and also stole other jewels for a total of $9m.",
      "The men were arrested three months later alongside several other people thought to be accessories to the crime.",
      "Twelve were eventually due to appear in court, although one died in March and another has been excused due to health reasons. Of the remaining 10, all but two deny any involvement in the burglary. The jewels were never found but police think they were broken up and sold on.",

      "\"They may have made mistakes but they were still a decent team,\" said the lead investigator of the Brigade de R\u00e9pression du Banditisme (Banditry Repression Brigade) special unit last week.",
      "He noted that the burglars tied up Kardashian's feet and ankles with cable ties and stuck tape on her mouth, and they took a car to park near the scene of the crime and used burner phones.",
      "\"That was well done,\" he said. \"They pulled it off, because they managed to flog the goods and palm off a $4m ring in Antwerp, which isn't that easy,\" he added.",
      "In his testimony, Ouatiki also painted a frightening picture of one of the burglars who he said was wielding a gun and was \"stressed and shouting\u2026 You feel that's someone that can be very dangerous.\"",
      "Ouatiki acted as an interpreter between the man and Kardashian and said he did his best to \"calm things down as I didn't know what he was capable of\".",
      "When the burglars tied up Kardashian and took her to the bathroom, she was only wearing a bathrobe and the belt came undone, the court heard. Asked by Kardashian's lawyer L\u00e9onore Hennerick to describe the moment, Ouatiki declined to go into detail. \"You have to respect the victim, I think,\" he said.",
      "Referencing that moment in an emotional interview in 2020, Kardashian told American journalist David Letterman that she thought she was going to be sexually assaulted.",
      "\"I was like, 'Okay, this is the time I'm going to get raped',\" she said.",
      "She added that she feared for her life and that she was worried for her sister Kourtney, who was out at a club: \"I'm gonna be dead in the room and she's gonna be traumatised for the rest of her life.\"",
      "Instead, the burglars grabbed her ring as well as various other jewels, phone and \u20ac1,000 in cash and ran off. Kardashian was quickly able to untie herself and her bodyguard arrived shortly after. She gave a statement to police in the early hours of 3 October and immediately flew back to the US.",
      "For his part, Ouatiki \u2013 an Algerian national who at the time was a PhD student in semiotics \u2013 said he suffered greatly from speculation in the media that he may have been in on the heist.",
      "\"The suspicion was very heavy to bear,\" he told the court.",
      "Ouatiki told French media he lost his student status shortly after the heist and had to go back to Algeria, where he was diagnosed with PTSD.",
      "\"It was a catastrophe, my life fell apart,\" he told Le Point.",

      "The latest report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said there had been a \"major deterioration\" since October 2024, but concluded famine was not currently occurring.",
      "The two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas \"led to a temporary reprieve\" in Gaza, the report said, but renewed hostilities and an Israeli blockade on aid - ongoing since early March - had \"reversed\" any improvements.",

      "The IPC assessment, released on Monday, found half a million people - or one in five - were facing starvation in Gaza. It said nearly 71,000 children under the age of five are expected to be acutely malnourished over the next 11 months to April 2026.",
      "It added: \"Many households are resorting to extreme measures to find food, including begging, and collecting garbage to sell to buy something to eat.\"",

      "The fate of his daughter Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing an impeachment trial, remains in the balance.",
      "The mid-terms held on Monday saw 18,000 seats contested, from local officials to governors and senators. It served as a proxy war between Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte, who were one-time allies.",

      "It was the assassination of opposition leader Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr in 1983 that galvanised protests against Ferdinand Marcos Sr - the current president's father - culminating in the Marcos family's ouster and exile in 1986.",
      "Monday's result signals their comeback after being wiped out of national politics in recent years.",
      "Results so far also show the Dutertes have managed to retain their power base in the south of the country, just two months after the 80-year-old populist leader Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Manila Airport and flown to the Netherlands on the same day to face the International Criminal Court.",
      "It was his arrest - approved by Marcos Jr - which pushed the rivalry between his daughter and the current president to boiling point, a few weeks after the president's allies in the House of Representatives voted to impeach Vice-President Duterte.",
      "Rodrigo Duterte was always expected to win as mayor, given the family has held the post since the mid-1980s.",
      "Duterte himself led Davao, a sprawling southern metropolis, for two decades before he was elected president in 2016. There, he showcased his drug war that he credited for the city's success, and won him the support of millions far beyond its borders.",
      "His youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor, was elected vice-mayor, meaning he can discharge his father's duties in his absence. Another Duterte son, Paolo, was re-elected as congressman. His grandchildren won local posts.",
      "Duterte's name remained on the ballot as he has not been convicted of any crime. He beat the scion of a smaller rival political family.",
      "Maintaining a political base in Davao city in the south is crucial for the Dutertes - it is where they get the most voter support.",
      "The election was not just a battle between the two families, however.",

      "US President Donald Trump has defended the White House plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar to be used as America's Air Force One presidential plane.",
      "\"They're giving us a gift,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday, adding that he would be \"a stupid person\" if he did not accept it.",
      "In an earlier statement, a Qatari spokesman said it would be \"inaccurate\" to refer to the plane as a gift. He said the transfer of an aircraft for \"temporary use\" was under discussion between the two countries.",
      "The news comes as Trump is set to visit Qatar this week as part of the first major foreign trip of his second term.",
      "Speaking on Monday, Trump said that the US had helped the other country \"a lot over the years in terms of security and safety\" and that he had \"a lot of respect for the leadership\" of the country.",
      "He went on to say it would be a \"very nice gesture\" if Qatar provided the US with a Boeing jet while his government continued to wait for two new ones to be provided directly by Boeing itself.",
      "The potential value of the plane and its handling has raised legal and ethical questions among critics on the political left and right.",
      "The US Constitution has a provision known as the Emoluments Clause, which restricts what gifts US presidents can accept from foreign governments. It was designed to prevent leaders from becoming beholden to foreign governments.",
      "On social media, Democratic Senator Adam Schiff from California quoted a section of the US Constitution that said no elected official could accept \"any present... of any kind whatever\" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval.",

      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Sunday that \"any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump's administration is committed to full transparency\".",
      "The White House's current fleet includes two Boeing 747-200B planes customised for presidential use with special communications equipment and features like a state room, office and conference room. The planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991.",
      "Qatar is said to be offering a version of a Boeing 747-8, a much newer model that ABC News reports has been upgraded into a \"flying palace\".",
      "The plane, reported to be worth about $400m (\u00a3303m), would not be ready for use right away if provided to the US, as it would need to be retrofitted and cleared by security officials, sources told CBS, the BBC's US partner.",
      "Boeing has already been contracted to directly provide the White House with two 747-8s directly, but Trump complained earlier this year that the firm was behind schedule.",
      "His team negotiated to receive these during his first term in office, though Boeing has cautioned that they will not be available for two or three more years.",
      "I'm not happy with Boeing, Trump says over Air Force One",
      "I'm not happy with Boeing, Trump says over Air Force One",
      "Qatar - a country with which Trump has long had a positive relationship - has also previously given private jets as gifts to other countries, including Turkey.",
      "This would not be the first Trump-related deal with Qatar. Last month, his company signed a deal to build a luxury golf resort there, marking its first foreign deal since the Republican returned to office in January.",
      "According to CBS, the plane that Trump could acquire would be donated at the end of his term to his presidential library, which is a collection of artefacts related to a US leader's time in office.",
      "Air Force One planes usually carry over to other administrations. According to the National Archives, only the presidential library for Ronald Reagan has an Air Force One jet.",
      "Trump, a businessman-turned-president, has been no stranger to conflict-of-interest accusations since taking office in 2017. During his first term, critics accused him of enriching himself in a number of ways, including through his hotel in Washington DC. A lawsuit followed, but was never concluded.",
      "Commenting on the potential transfer of the plane, David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, told the BBC: \"It certainly stinks, but formally it's a transfer to the [US] government, not the office holder.\"",
      "However, the jet could be viewed as an illegal personal gift to Trump if he is able to use it in his private life after leaving office, Prof Super added.",
      "As for who could protest such a move - Congress could pass a resolution denouncing it, said Prof Super, albeit this would be unlikely given the Republican dominance on Capitol Hill, and it would not stop the actual transfer."

      "Legendary India batter Virat Kohli has announced his immediate retirement from Test cricket.",
      "His decision comes before this summer's five-Test tour of England, which starts on 20 June, and follows captain Rohit Sharma's retirement on Wednesday.",
      "Kohli, 36, has played 123 Tests for India and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85.",
      "\"It's been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket,\" Kohli posted on social media.",
      "\"Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It's tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I'll carry for life.\"",
      "Kohli retired from T20 internationals in 2024, after India's World Cup victory, but is expected to continue playing one-day internationals.",
      "After making his Test debut against West Indies in 2011, Kohli went on to captain India in 68 of his Tests, with his 40 wins in charge making him the country's most successful leader in the format.",

      "Virat Kohli Retires from Test Cricket: End of an Era?",
      "Virat Kohli Retires from Test Cricket: End of an Era?",
      "\"There's something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no-one sees but that stay with you forever,\" he added.",
      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy - but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for.",
      "\"I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude - for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way. I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile.\"",
      "India cricket's governing body, the BCCI, praised Kohli for \"redefining the standards of excellence, leadership and commitment in Indian cricket\".",
      "BCCI president Roger Binny added: \"Virat Kohli's name will be remembered alongside the finest ever to have graced Test cricket.",
      "\"What set him apart was not just his hunger for runs, but his commitment to excellence in the toughest format of the game. His leadership marked a shift in how India competed overseas\u2014with aggression, belief and a refusal to settle for second best.",
      "\"He inspired a generation to take pride in the whites, and his impact on Indian cricket will be felt for decades to come.\"",
      "Kohli has long been regarded as one of the four batting greats of his era, alongside England's Joe Root, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, and has scored 30 Test centuries.",
      "Only Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar have scored more Test runs for India than Kohli, while he has the most centuries for an India captain with 20.",
      "But his most recent Test ton, 100 not out in the first Test against Australia in November, was his first in 15 innings across 16 months.",
      "During that series, he scored 190 runs in nine innings averaging just 23.75.",
      "Only three tons have come in 39 Tests since January 2020. He averages 30.72 in that time.",
      "'Farewell to cricket's greatest showman'",
      "Analysis by chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt",
      "And so cricket's greatest showman leaves its grandest stage. Not with a final century, wave of the bat or guard of honour, but with a post to his 271m Instagram followers. The end of an aura.",
      "It is hard to overstate Kohli's fame, stardom or influence. He is the biggest presence in the most powerful cricketing nation on the planet. Maybe his name does not travel globally like a Ronaldo or Messi, yet even those two titans will have no idea what it feels like to be Virat Kohli in India.",
      "As a batter, Kohli continued the talismanic lineage of Gavaskar, Azharuddin and Tendulkar. His cover drive is a work of art. In 2018, a Kohli net session in Adelaide went viral, the ball leaving the bat with sound of a pistol being fired. He is the first of the Fab Four to leave Test cricket and while his numbers do not stack up to Smith, Root and Williamson, Kohli is the most pleasing to watch.",
      "As a leader, Kohli dragged the India Test side into the 21st Century. Having more Test wins than any other India captain is statistically significant, though that pales when compared to what Kohli did for his team and Test cricket itself.",
      "It is not an exaggeration to say Kohli was the most important factor in upkeeping the relevance of the longest format when it could otherwise have been completely swallowed by the T20 leagues.",
      "Kohli follows Rohit Sharma into retirement as the regeneration of the India Test team continues. The XI that lines up to face England at Headingley in late June will have an unfamiliar feel. There may be more one-day internationals to savour. In that format, Kohli really is the GOAT.",
      "Even with the histrionics, everything he did was must-see. Without Kohli, Test cricket will be a poorer spectacle.",
      "'Nobody did more for Test cricket' - tributes to Kohli",
      "Kohli, right, was seen as the heir to Sachin Tendulkar in Indian cricket",
      "\"In my time playing and broadcasting no individual has done as much for Test cricket as Virat Kohli. His passion, energy and commitment to the greatest format has helped so much. I hope the next generation of Indian players take on his mantle.\" Michael Vaughan, ex-England captain",
      "\"I'm reminded of your thoughtful gesture 12 years ago, during my last Test. You offered to gift me a thread from your late father. It was something too personal for me to accept, but the gesture was heart-warming and has stayed with me ever since. While I may not have a thread to offer in return, please know that you carry my deepest admiration and very best wishes. Your true legacy, Virat, lies in inspiring countless young cricketers to pick up the sport.\" India batting great Sachin Tendulkar",
      "\"Absolute legend of our game. I'll never forget our first game against each other when we were young. I thought this guy was a serious competitor and going to be great, someone everyone would admire. You had to fill the shoes of some great players to ever play for India and carry the nation. Wow, you did not disappoint. Thank you for being you, which got the best out of all of us who competed against you.\" Ex-Australia batter David Warner",
      "\"Anything I write for you, paji (brother), will never truly capture what I feel or the impact you've had on me. From watching you bat when I was 13 and wondering how someone could bring that kind of energy to the field, to sharing the field with you and realizing no one else possibly can. You've not just inspired a generation, you've reshaped the mindset of millions.\" Shubman Gill, India batter",

      "Poland has accused Russian intelligence services of orchestrating a massive fire that nearly completely destroyed a shopping centre in the capital Warsaw last year.",
      "In a post on X, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland knows \"for sure\" that the blaze at the Marywilska shopping centre was caused by arson ordered by the Russian special services.",
      "Some of those responsible are already in custody, Tusk added, while all the others alleged to have been involved have been identified and are being searched for.",
      "Moscow has not commented on the allegations, but has previously denied accusations of sabotage in Europe.",
      "The fire in May 2024 destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff there being members of Warsaw's Vietnamese community.",
      "Poland carried out a year-long investigation into the incident, which has now concluded the fire was organised by an unnamed person in Russia.",
      "A joint statement by Poland's justice and interior ministers said the actions of those in custody were \"organised and directed by a specific person residing in the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The two ministries added that they were co-operating with Lithuania \"where some of the perpetrators also carried out acts of diversion\".",
      "Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has detained and convicted several people accused of sabotage on behalf of Russian intelligence services.",

    "summary": "As the president goes to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE he wants them to buy more from the States.",
    "story": [
      "With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy.",
      "\"President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],\" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.",
      "\"He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.\"",
      "Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.",
      "The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",
      "Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.",
      "Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results.",
      "The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.",
      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",
      "According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.",
      "\"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.",
      "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'",
      "US economy shrinks as firms import more ahead of tariffs",
      "Optimism and uncertainty at summit as Middle East awaits Trump\u2019s return",
      "Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid.",
      "Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.",
      "Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken \"with a little bit of a grain of salt\".",
      "Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items.",
      "These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft.",
      "The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen.",
      "The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder.",
      "The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.",
      "Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a \"more efficient procurement system\", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily.",
      "\"The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,\" he adds.",
      "Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors.",
      "The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil.",
      "The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states.",
      "The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE.",
      "\"For the UAE, this is absolutely essential,\" says Ms Young. \"They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best.\"",
      "While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program.",
      "Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil.",
      "It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports.",
      "However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital.",
      "The fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained Riyadh's finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals.",
      "Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low amid growing concerns that a trade war could dampen global economic growth.",
      "The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.",
      "Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump, who has called for lower oil prices.",
      "Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing.",
      "The US-Saudi Business Council, is an organisation that aims to boost trade ties between the two countries.",
      "It is hoping that Trump's visit will push American businesses to explore more opportunities in Saudi Arabia, especially in sectors like AI, healthcare and education.",
      "\"The Saudi government is looking heavily to invest in these sectors. There is a very big appetite for Saudi companies to collaborate with American companies,\" Hutham Al Jalal, who heads the Riyadh office for the organisation, tells the BBC.",
      "Saudi officials are said to be confident that some deals in these sectors will be secured during Trump's visit.",
      "For Saudi Arabia, Trump's visit is about strengthening ties with their longest-standing Western ally - a relationship that grew strained during the Biden years. For President Trump, it is about landing investment deals that can be framed as a win for his economic agenda.",

    "summary": "Capt Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, 37, is portraying himself as a champion of pan-Africanism.",
    "story": [
      "A charismatic 37-year-old, Burkina Faso's military ruler Capt Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 has skilfully built the persona of a pan-Africanist leader determined to free his nation from what he regards as the clutches of Western imperialism and neo-colonialism.",
      "His message has resonated across Africa and beyond, with his admirers seeing him as following in the footsteps of African heroes like Burkina Faso's very own Thomas Sankara - a Marxist revolutionary who is sometimes referred to as \"Africa's Che Guevara\".",
      "\"Traor\u00e9's impact is huge. I have even heard politicians and authors in countries like Kenya [in East Africa] say: 'This is it. He is the man',\" Beverly Ochieng, a senior researcher at global consultancy firm Control Risks, told the BBC.",
      "\"His messages reflect the age we are living in, when many Africans are questioning the relationship with the West, and why there is still so much poverty in such a resource-rich continent,\" she said.",
      "After seizing power in a coup in 2022, Traor\u00e9's regime ditched former colonial power France in favour of a strong alliance with Russia, that has included the deployment of a Russian paramilitary brigade, and adopted left-wing economic policies.",
      "This included setting up a state-owned mining company, requiring foreign firms to give it a 15% stake in their local operations and to transfer skills to Burkinab\u00e9 people.",
      "The rule also applied to Russian miner Nordgold, which was given a licence in late April for its latest investment in Burkina Faso's gold industry.",
      "As part of what Traor\u00e9 calls a \"revolution\" to ensure Burkina Faso benefits from its mineral wealth, the junta is also building a gold refinery and establishing national gold reserves for the first time in the nation's history.",
      "However, Western-owned firms appear to be facing a tough time, with Australia-headquartered Sarama Resources launching arbitration proceedings against Burkina Faso in late 2024 following the withdrawal of an exploration licence.",
      "The junta has also nationalised two gold mines previously owned by a London-listed firm, and said last month that it planned to take control of more foreign-owned mines.",
      "Enoch Randy Aikins, a researcher at South Africa's Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC that Traor\u00e9's radical reforms had increased his popularity in Africa.",
      "\"He is now arguably Africa's most popular, if not favourite, president,\" Mr Aikins said.",
      "His popularity has been fuelled through social media, including many misleading posts intended to bolster his revolutionary image.",
      "AI-generated videos of music stars like R Kelly, Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Beyonc\u00e9 are seen immortalising him through song - though they have done nothing of the sort.",
      "Ms Ochieng said that Traor\u00e9 first caught the attention of Africans when he spoke at the Russia-Africa summit in 2023, telling African leaders to \"stop behaving like puppets who dance every time the imperialists pull the strings\".",
      "This speech was heavily publicised by Russian media, which has become a major player in promoting Traor\u00e9's pan-Africanist image.",
      "Traor\u00e9 attended commemorations in Russia last week to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. He posted on X that he, along with military leaders from neighbouring Mali and Niger, were inspired by it \"to winning the war against terrorism and imperialism at all costs\".",
      "Thanks to his rhetoric and pushed by a slick social media campaign, his appeal has spread around the world, including among African-Americans and Black Britons, Ms Ochieng noted.",
      "\"Everyone who has experienced racism, colonialism and slavery can relate to his messages,\" Ms Ochieng said, pointing out that African-American rapper Meek Mill had posted about him on X late last year, saying how much he liked his \"energy and heart\" - though he was ridiculed for mixing up names by referring to Traor\u00e9 as Burkina Faso and later deleted the post.",
      "But France's president is not a fan, describing Traor\u00e9 as part of a \"baroque alliance between self-proclaimed pan-Africans and neo-imperialists\".",
      "Emmanuel Macron was also referring to Russia and China whom he accused, in a 2023 speech, of provoking coups in Africa's former French colonies, and hypocritically stirring up old arguments over sovereignty and colonial exploitation.",
      "Traor\u00e9's popularity comes despite the fact that he has failed to fulfil his pledge to quell a 10-year Islamist insurgency that has fuelled ethnic divisions and has now spread to once-peaceful neighbours like Benin.",
      "His junta has also cracked down on dissent, including the opposition, media and civil society groups and punished critics, among them medics and magistrates, by sending them to the front-lines of the war against the jihadists.",
      "For Rinaldo Depagne, the Africa deputy director of the International Crisis Group think-tank, Traor\u00e9 commands such support because \"he is young in a country with a young population\" - the median age is 17.7 years.",
      "\"He is media-savvy, and uses the past to build his popularity as a reincarnation of Sankara,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"And he knows the art of politics - how to make a nation completely traumatised by war feel there is a better future. He is really good at that game.\"",
      "Sankara rose to power in a coup in 1983 at the age of 33, rallied the nation under the motto \"Fatherland or death, we will win!\", and was killed four years later in another coup that put Burkina Faso back in France's political orbit until Traor\u00e9's seizure of power.",
      "Ghanaian security analyst Prof Kwesi Aning, who previously worked at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, said the popularity of the military leader reflected a political shift taking place on the continent, especially in West Africa.",
      "A 2024 survey in 39 countries by Afrobarometer showed a drop in support for democracy, although it remained the most popular form of government.",
      "\"Democracy has failed to give hope to the youth. It has not delivered jobs or better education and health,\" Prof Aning told the BBC.",
      "He said Traor\u00e9 was \"offering an alternative, and re-capturing the spirit of two historic epochs\":",
      "The post-independence era, when there were leaders like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and Kenneth Kaunda of ZambiaAnd a later era with Sankara and Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, whose coup in 1979 \"was also very popular at the time\".",
      "The post-independence era, when there were leaders like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia",
      "And a later era with Sankara and Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, whose coup in 1979 \"was also very popular at the time\".",
      "It was Traor\u00e9 who stole the show at the inauguration of Ghana's President John Mahama in January, when he arrived wearing battle fatigues with a pistol in his holster.",
      "\"There were already 21 heads of state there, but when Traor\u00e9 walked in, the place lit up. Even my president's bodyguards were running after him,\" Prof Aning said.",
      "Traor\u00e9 offered a sharply contrasting image to some of the continent's other leaders, who struggled to walk but clung to power by rigging elections, he said.",
      "\"Traor\u00e9 is stylish and confident, with a very open face and a small smile. He is also a powerful orator, and presents himself as a man of the people.\"",
      "In a sign that his Russian-allied junta has made some progress on the economic front, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have given a generally upbeat assessment.",
      "In a statement in early April, the IMF said that despite a \"challenging humanitarian and security\" environment, the economy was expected to remain \"robust\" in 2025, and the regime had made \"commendable progress\" in raising domestic revenue, containing the public wage bill, and increasing spending on education, health and social protection.",
      "As for the World Bank, it said that inflation had surged from 0.7% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024, but the extreme poverty rate, which refers to people living on less than $2.15 [\u00a31.61] a day, had fallen by almost two percentage points to 24.9% because of \"robust growth\" in the agriculture and services sectors.",
      "Despite these reports from US-based financial institutions, relations with both France and America have been frosty.",
      "A recent example being the claim by the head of the US Africa Command, Gen Michael Langley, that Traor\u00e9 was using Burkina Faso's gold reserves for his junta's protection rather than the nation's benefit.",
      "This appeared to be a reference to the long-standing view of the US, and some of its African allies, that Russian forces were propping up Traor\u00e9 in exchange for a stake in Burkina Faso's gold industry - undermining the military ruler's image as a leader who expelled French troops in 2023 to reclaim the country's sovereignty.",
      "Gen Langley's comments, made in early April during a US Senate committee hearing, triggered an uproar among the captain's supporters, who felt their hero was being smeared.",
      "This was further inflamed when shortly afterwards, the Burkinab\u00e9 junta said it had foiled a coup plot, alleging the plotters were based in neighbouring Ivory Coast - where Gen Langley then made a visit.",
      "Ivory Coast denied being involved in any plot, while the US Africa Command said Gen Langley's visit had focused on addressing \"common security challenges\" - including \"violent extremism\".",
      "But the junta took the opportunity to organise one of its biggest rallies in Burkina Faso's capital over fears that \"imperialists\" and their \"lackeys\" were trying to depose the captain.",
      "\"Because Colin Powell lied, Iraq was destroyed. Barack Obama lied, Gaddafi was killed. But this time, their lies won't affect us,\" one protester, musician Ocibi Johann, told the Associated Press news agency.",
      "Rallies in solidarity with Traor\u00e9 were also held abroad, including in London, on the same day.",
      "He took to social media afterwards, posting in French and English, to express his gratitude to them for sharing his vision \"for a new Burkina Faso and a new Africa\", adding: \"Together, in solidarity, we will defeat imperialism and neo-colonialism for a free, dignified and sovereign Africa.\"",
      "It is impossible to say how things will end for the young captain, but he - along with military leaders in Mali and Niger - have certainly shaken up West Africa, and other states have followed their example by ordering French forces to leave.",
      "The three military-ruled neighbours have also pulled out of the regional trade and security grouping Ecowas, formed their own alliance, and have ended free trade in the region by announcing the imposition of a 0.5% tariff on goods coming into their countries.",
      "Mr Aikins said Traor\u00e9 could learn from others, pointing out that when Rawlings took power in Ghana at the age of 32, he was known as \"Junior Jesus\" but after 19 years he left a mixed legacy - he had been unable to stem corruption despite helping to create an \"enduring\" democracy.",
      "For a \"lasting legacy\", Mr Aikins said, Traor\u00e9 should focus on achieving peace and  building strong state institutions to bring about good governance rather than \"personalising\" power and cracking down on dissent.",

      "This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently\". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.",

      "Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\".",

    "summary": "Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Stryven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "summary": "Severe air pollution is obscuring visibility of the highest mountain peaks on Earth, hitting tourism hard.",
    "story": [
      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna KC, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",
      "\"We are left to do business with guilt when we are unable to show our clients the mountains that they pay us for,\" said trekking leader Ms Chhetri.",

    "story": [
      "For decades, if there's one thing that's been a taboo in the Indian foreign ministry, it is third-party mediation - particularly in the long-running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.",
      "Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi.",
      "On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US.",
      "Later, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\"",
      "The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.",
      "Several rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.",
      "The latest flare-up began after India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, killing 26 people, mainly tourists.",
      "India blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.",
      "Trump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.",
      "The two sides were using fighter jets, missiles and drones and said they were targeting each other's military installations, mainly in the border areas.",
      "While US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.",
      "\"Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,\" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.",
      "Islamabad, on the other hand, has welcomed Trump's comments.",
      "\"We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute - a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,\" a  foreign ministry statement said..",
      "Delhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir.",
      "President Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to \"internationalise\" the Kashmir dispute.",
      "The main opposition Congress party wanted an explanation from the government and an all-party meeting on the \"ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first\".",
      "\"Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation? The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened,\" said the Congress party spokesman Jairam Ramesh.",
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement announcing the ceasefire also said that the two countries have also agreed \"to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site\". This has caught the Indians by surprise.",
      "Delhi has refused to hold discussions with Islamabad, accusing its neighbour of supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism.",
      "Historically, India has opposed any third-party mediation, quoting an agreement signed in 1972 after a war between the two countries a year earlier. As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they \"resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations\".",
      "Indian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "The conflict took place months after the then Indian and Pakistani prime ministers agreed to resolve issues through bilateral negotiations and refrain from interfering in each other's internal matters.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not formally responded to President Trump's offer to mediate.",
      "But Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: \"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.\"",
      "It is being seen as an indication that India may not be restarting direct bilateral talks soon.",
      "The view from Pakistan is different.",
      "\"Pakistan has always wanted third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue in the absence of mutual trust between the two countries,\" Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Centre for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Now a superpower is willing to stick its neck out. Pakistan will see this as a moral victory,\" Mr Gul says.",
      "Pakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.",
      "\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.",
      "India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.",
      "But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances.",
      "The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "In recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.",
      "The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds.",
      "The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.",
      "Delhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or \"understanding\" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US.",
      "Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of."

    "summary": "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
    "story": [
      "The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries.",
      "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.",
      "Here's what it all means.",
      "What has been announced?",
      "Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "The deal involves both nations cancelling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, by 14 May.",
      "The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall to from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.",
      "China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US, which it put in place in response to the initial escalation.",
      "The US measures still include an extra 20% component aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug.",
      "The announcement came after the two countries held talks in Switzerland, the first between the two countries since Trump sparked the latest tariff war.",
      "What happens after 90 days?",
      "Trying to predict the next steps in this ongoing trade war between the US and China  these past few months has been difficult to say the least.",
      "But this is a major agreement between the world's two powerhouse economies and has been broadly welcomed.",
      "Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.",
      "However, talks between both governments are set to continue, so a further deal might be struck.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the consensus from both countries was that \"neither side wants a decoupling\", while China's commerce ministry said the agreement was a step to \"lay the foundation to bridge differences and deepen co-operation\".",
      "So relations between the US and China are sounding more friendly, but as we've seen so far during this Trump presidency, things can change quickly.",
      "What goods do the US and China trade with each other?",
      "In a word - lots.",
      "In 2024, the biggest category of goods exported from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs. The US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum.",
      "Meanwhile, China exported large volumes of electronics, computers and toys.",
      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones Apple iPhones made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",
      "The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",
      "Has either side won?",
      "Politicians on both sides have started and will no doubt continue to claim victory over this truce.",
      "Despite the US and China calling this a joint agreement, people in Beijing will interpret it as the Trump administration walking back from the tariffs, according to Janka Oertel, director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"We are back to square one, now negotiating can begin. The outcome is uncertain but China is in a psychologically stronger position now than before,\" she said.",
      "The US will argue its tariff rate on Chinese imports, although lower, is still hefty at 30%.",
      "\"This trade deal is a win for the United States, demonstrating President Trump's unparalleled expertise in securing deals that benefit the American people,\" a White  House statement said.",
      "Economists at Deutsche Bank have suggested the lowering of tariffs, and last week's UK-US deal on them, means there's both \"a likely cap and floor\" to Trump's rates.",
      "\"The UK has one of the least imbalanced relationships with the US and now has a universal tariff rate of 10%. China has one of the most imbalanced relationships and now has a tariff rate of 30%,\" said George Saravelos, head of FX research at the investment bank.",
      "\"It is reasonable that these two numbers now set the bounds of where American tariffs will end up this year.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 22:02:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The president promises sweeping price cuts \"almost immediately\", but experts say these are unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices \u2013 but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.",
      "Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.",
      "He touted the move as \"one of the most consequential\" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall \"almost immediately, by 30% to 80%\".",
      "But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.",
      "Why are American drug prices so high?",
      "The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsides, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.",
      "In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.",
      "In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.",
      "Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.",
      "Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.",
      "\"The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,\" Trump told reporters. \"But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.\"",
      "It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs \u2013 which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.",
      "What was in Trump's order?",
      "Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.",
      "The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" price hikes for Americans.",
      "But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear \u2013 as is the question of what measures the White House would take if \"unreasonable\" practices are discovered.",
      "The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.",
      "An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.",
      "What is Most Favoured Nation status?",
      "The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status \u2013 meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.",
      "\"Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",
      "Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.",
      "\"Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,\" Prof Sager said.",
      "\"Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,\" he said. \"This is rhetoric, not reality.\"",
      "How did markets react?",
      "Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.",
      "But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans \u2013 an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.",
      "What else could hinder Trump's plan?",
      "To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that \"shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans\".",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health \u2013 and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.",
      "However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.",
      "C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices \"will be minimal for many Americans\" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs \"are a positive step in the right direction\".",
      "But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.",
      "What does industry say?",
      "Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive \u2013 potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.",
      "Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for American patients.",
      "John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status \"a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies\" by potentially choking off funding for research.",
      "\"Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated \u2013 first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.\"",
      "But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.",
      "Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.",
      "\"Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,\" he said.",

      "Dust was rising on the track. It hung in the hot midday air as the white jeep came towards us. The driver was less than a minute away.",
      "\"I think it's Moshe Sharvit,\" said Gil Alexander, 72, a devout religious Jew who tries to protect Palestinian shepherds from intimidation by Jewish settlers.",
      "Over the last year we've been documenting his work with shepherds in the northern Jordan Valley, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "The man approaching us was placed under sanctions by Britain and the EU last year after they said he had used  \"physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities\".",
      "In a case reported by our colleagues at BBC Eye Investigates last year, a Palestinian grandmother alleged that Moshe Sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in October 2023. Ayesha Shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her.",

      "Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West Bank, together",
      "Extremist settlers rapidly seizing West Bank land",
      "\"We've been here for 50 years\u2026What have I ever done to him?\" she asked when BBC Eye interviewed her.",
      "She said her family's troubles began after Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'- a settlement that is illegal under both Israeli and international law - chasing away the family's sheep, damaging property and constantly threatening them. The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw.",
      "Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account.",
      "Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: \"Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?\"",
      "When our translator explained to Moshe Sharvit we were from the BBC he said: \"Ah the BBC\u2026 great lovers of Israel\u2026\" He went on to call us bad and dangerous people.",
      "Addressing our translator he said: \"So, do you understand that they're the people who are most dangerous to the State of Israel?\"",
      "Then he phoned the police, asking them to come to the scene. When he wasn't calling the police he filmed us filming him.",
      "Moshe Sharvit and Gil Alexander represent starkly different visions of Israel's future.",
      "Moshe Sharvit believes all of the West Bank - which settlers and the Israeli government call Judea and Samaria - were given by God to the Jews.",
      "In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties.",
      "Smotrich has said Gaza will be \"totally destroyed\" and that its people will be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\".",
      "The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation.",
      "Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, relies on the support of the far-right settler movement to keep his government in power.",
      "He criticised the sanctions imposed on Moshe Sharvit and other settlers, saying his government viewed the move \"with great severity\". US sanctions against Moshe Sharvit were dropped when President Donald Trump came to power.",
      "The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal.",
      "Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank.",
      "Settlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel.",
      "These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists \u2013 Moshe Sharvit calls them \"anarchists\" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians.",
      "\"What they [the settlers] want to see happen,\" Gil Alexander told us, \"[is] that it will be an area completely free of Arabs. It isn't Moshe. It's all the people above him who sent him here. Meaning from the top\".",
      "Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler.",
      "In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us \"the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image\".",
      "As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan.",
      "\"This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.\"",
      "Gil Alexander and Moshe Sharvit have a history of antagonism. During an altercation on a Palestinian farmer's land in January 2023, Moshe Sharvit says Gil Alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster.",
      "While speaking to our translator he produced a video of the incident on his phone.",
      "\"You can see Gil Alexander. Same hat and glasses. That's me. Here you see he grabs my gun.\"",
      "Gil Alexander says he was acting in self-defence after Moshe Sharvit had grabbed his walking stick, and the phone of a woman friend who he alleges was pushed violently to the ground.",
      "He says he feared Moshe Sharvit was going to use the weapon. As a result, Moshe Sharvit got a restraining order which forbids Gil Alexander from being within 2.5km (1.5 miles) of his farm.",
      "The police have charged Gil Alexander with illegal possession of a weapon (the one he allegedly tried to take from Moshe Sharvit) and assault. The issue will be considered by the Israeli courts.",
      "Moshe Sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a Palestinian family living near his outpost for six months, since March this year.",
      "During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order.",
      "Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed.",
      "Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages.",
      "The violence has escalated sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped, and which triggered the Gaza war.",
      "According to a report issued by the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs there were 1,804 attacks by settlers against Palestinians in the period January 2024 to March 2025.",
      "The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured.",
      "In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave.",
      "As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving.",
      "Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come.",
      "Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: \"Bring the camera.\"",
      "What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said.",
      "Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked.",
      "\"No, that is a lie. They're telling stories so the world will think we're crazy. It's not true. It's all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying\u2026\" he said.",
      "\"The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.\"",
      "He repeated the analogy of the Lion later in the interview saying, in what sounded like ominous words, that the Palestinians were \"pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story\".",
      "\"7 October was small. One day it'll be big.\"",
      "As for peaceful co-existence such as Gil Alexander supports, he said there was \"no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you\".",
      "Moshe Sharvit's brother Harel was killed fighting in Gaza in December 2023.",
      "His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened.",
      "He produced a glossy video, replete with a backing track of American country music, to promote his venture.",
      "He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed.",
      "\"The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spirit\u2026I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.\"",
      "Then he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a caf\u00e9 about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander.",
      "He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident.",
      "We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago.",
      "Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself.",
      "He said: \"A son of our friends, two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist. He was a soldier in the reserves, 46 years old with six children. He volunteered for the reserves to protect me.\"",
      "\"If the army hadn't been there, they would have come here. He was killed while defending me. And today he is buried next to my two sons.\"",
      "But Gil Alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his well-tended garden, and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise Israel's hostages held in Gaza.",
      "He spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in Lebanon in an earlier war.",
      "Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed.",
      "There was no chance of that. After two of his sons took their own lives \u2013 one was in the army, the other was about to enter the military \u2013 he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the \"humanitarian\" ideals of Judaism.",
      "\"After the tragedies of my sons, if I don't find meaning in life, I'll go crazy\u2026 And the things I do, are things I believe in. And these are things I also got from my father who was in the French underground during World War Two and fought for French liberation but was against any type of occupation and said, 'Occupation is Occupation.'\"",
      "Two days after our encounter with Moshe Sharvit, a lone woman peace activist filmed him banging on the window of her car and rocking the vehicle.",

    "story": [
      "Before Silvana Santos arrived in the little town of Serrinha dos Pintos more than 20 years ago, residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk.",
      "The remote town in north-eastern Brazil is home to fewer than 5,000 people, and is where biologist and geneticist Santos identified and named a previously unknown condition: Spoan syndrome.",
      "Caused by a genetic mutation, the syndrome affects the nervous system, gradually weakening the body. It only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents.",
      "Santos's research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world. For this and later work, she was named one of the BBC's 100 most influential women in 2024.",
      "Before Santos arrived, families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children. Today, residents talk confidently about Spoan and genetics.",
      "\"She gave us a diagnosis we never had. After the research, help came: people, funding, wheelchairs,\" says Marquinhos, one of the patients.",
      "Serrinha dos Pintos: a world of its own",
      "Where Santos is from in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from Serrinha. Many of them were cousins of varying degrees, married to each other.",
      "They told Santos that many of people in their hometown couldn't walk, but that no-one knew why.",
      "One of the neighbours' daughters, Zirl\u00e2ndia, suffered from a debilitating condition: as a child, her eyes moved involuntarily and over time, she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair, requiring help with even the simplest tasks.",
      "Years of investigation would lead Santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of Spoan syndrome.",
      "They would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide.",
      "At the invitation of her neighbours, Santos visited Serrinha on holiday. She describes her arrival as stepping into \"a world of its own\" - not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views, but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence.",
      "The more she walked and spoke with locals, the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were.",
      "Serrinha's geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related, making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable.",
      "Worldwide, marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10% in the early 2010s. More recent data shows the rate varies widely, from over 50% in countries like Pakistan, to 1-4% in Brazil and less than 1% in the US and Russia. Most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy, experts say.",
      "But these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family.",
      "\"If a couple is unrelated, the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2\u20133%. For cousins, the risk rises to 5\u20136% per pregnancy,\" explains geneticist Luzivan Costa Reis from Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.",
      "A 2010 study led by Santos showed that more than 30% of couples in Serrinha were related, and a third of them had at least one child with a disability.",
      "Long road to diagnosis",
      "Santos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of Serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study, requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region.",
      "She drove the 1,250 miles (2,000km) to and from S\u00e3o Paulo many times in the early years of her research. She collected DNA samples door-to-door, chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories, all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease.",
      "What was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication.",
      "It all led to the publication in 2005 of the team's study revealing the existence of Spoan in the Brazilian hinterland.",
      "Santos's team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome, which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells.",
      "\"They said it came from Maximiano, a womaniser in our family,\" recalls farmer Lol\u00f4, whose daughter Rejane has Spoan.",
      "Lol\u00f4, now 83, married his cousin and never left Serrinha. He still tends cattle and relies on family to care for Rejane, who struggles with daily tasks.",
      "But the genetic mutation behind Spoan is far older than the legend of Old Maximiano: it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early European settlers in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "\"Sequencing studies show strong European ancestry in patients, supporting records of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sephardic Jewish presence in the region,\" says Santos.",
      "The theory gained strength after two Spoan cases were found in Egypt, and further studies showed that the Egyptian cases also shared European ancestry, pointing to a common origin in the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "\"It likely came with related Sephardic Jews or Moors fleeing the Inquisition,\" says Santos. She believes more cases may exist globally, especially in Portugal.",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "Although there's been little progress toward a cure, tracking patients has brought some change. Rejane recalls how people used to be called \"cripples\". Now, they're simply said to have Spoan.",
      "Wheelchairs brought not just independence, but also helped prevent deformities - in the past, many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor.",
      "As Spoan progresses, physical limitations worsen with age and by 50, nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers.",
      "This is the case for In\u00e9s's children, who are among the oldest in Serrinha. Chiquinho, 59, can no longer speak, and Marquinhos, 46, has limited communication abilities.",
      "\"It's hard to have a 'special' child. We love them the same, but we suffer for them,\" says In\u00e9s, who is married to a second cousin.",
      "Larissa Queiroz, 25, the niece of Chiquinho and Marquinho, also married a distant relative. She and her husband, Saulo, only discovered their common ancestor after several months of dating.",
      "\"In Serrinha dos Pintos, deep down, we're all cousins. We're related to everyone,\" she says.",
      "Couples like Larissa and Saulo are the focus of a new research project which Santos is also involved in. Backed by Brazil's Ministry of Health, it will screen 5,000 couples for genes linked to serious recessive diseases.",
      "The goal is not to stop cousin marriages, but to help couples understand their genetic risks, says Santos. Now a university professor, she also leads a genetics education centre and works to expand testing in the north-east of Brazil.",
      "Though she no longer lives in Serrinha dos Pintos, every visit feels like coming home.",
      "\"It's as if Santos is family,\" says In\u00e9s."

      "Behind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.",
      "However, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility.",
      "India accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"",

We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview.",

      "She was just 26 years old at the time - and had clearly impressed Botswana's incoming President Duma Boko, whose Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) had just won a landslide, ousting the party that had governed for 58 years.",
      "It was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamond-rich southern African nation - and Boko, a 55-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, hit the ground running.",
      "His main focus, he said, was fixing an economy too reliant on diamonds, telling the BBC ahead of his inauguration that he wanted young people to be the solution - \"to become entrepreneurs, employ themselves and employ others\".",

      "This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season - this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.",
      "The minister reiterated - on several occasions, including before parliament in March - that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.",
      "But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.",

    "summary": "Charlie Hopkins was imprisoned in Alcatraz in the 1950s, where he spent three \"lonely\" years.",
    "story": [
      "When Charlie Hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of America's most famous prisons, he remembers the \"deathly quiet\" the most.",
      "In 1955, Hopkins was sent to Alcatraz - a famed prison on an isolated island off the coast of San Francisco - after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17-year sentence for kidnapping and robbery.",
      "Falling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island, he said, the only sound was the whistle of ships passing.",
      "\"That's a lonely sound,\" Hopkins said. \"It reminds you of Hank Williams singing that song, 'I'm so lonesome I could cry.'\"",
      "Now 93 and living in Florida, Hopkins said the San Francisco National Archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former Alcatraz inmate. Another former inmate, William Baker, appeared to be alive as of last year.",
      "In an interview with the BBC this week, Hopkins described life at Alcatraz - which formed the setting for the 1996 film The Rock - where he made friends with gangsters and once helped plan an unsuccessful escape.",
      "Although it closed decades ago, US President Donald Trump recently claimed that he wants to re-open it as a federal prison.",
      "When Hopkins was transferred to the high-security prison in 1955, from an Atlanta facility, he remembers it being clean, but barren. And there were few distractions - no radio at the time, and few books, he said.",
      "\"There was nothing to do,\" he said. \"You could walk back and forth in your cell or do push-ups.\"",
      "Hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them \"until they shined\", he said.",
      "He was sent to prison in 1952 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings. He was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars, he said.",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "At Alcatraz, Hopkins had some infamous neighbours. The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years - Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"; and crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger - making it the subject of a host of films and television shows.",
      "A 22-acre island, 1.25 miles (2km) off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort. It was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. The US Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time.",
      "Even in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's \"D Block\" - solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells.",
      "His longest stint there - six months - came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz, Hopkins said. He helped steal hacksaw blades from the prison's electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen.",
      "The plan didn't work - prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates' cells, Hopkins said. \"A few days after they locked them up, they locked me up,\" he said.",
      "But that did not stop one of the inmates.",
      "In 1956, when Tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation, he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons, Tucker told the New Yorker. Then, as he was taken to get an X-ray, he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away, he said.",
      "He was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later.",
      "As more prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz over the years, officials ramped up security, Hopkins said.",
      "\"When I left there in 1958, the security was so tight you couldn't breathe,\" he said.",
      "All told, there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates, according to the National Park Service.",
      "One of the most famous involved Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, who escaped in June 1962 by placing papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts. They were never found, but the FBI concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island.",
      "A year later, the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more cost-effective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation.",
      "Now it's a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about $60m (\u00a345m) a year in revenue for park partners.",
      "The building is decrepit, with peeling paint, rusted pipes, and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell. Construction on the main prison facility began in 1907, and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable.",
      "Trump said this week, however, that he wants his government to re-open and expand the island prison for the country's \"most ruthless and violent offenders\".",
      "Alcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order, Trump said.",
      "But experts and historians said Trump's proposal to re-establish the prison is far-fetched, as it would cost billions to repair and bring up to date with other federal facilities.",

    "summary": "It is a safeguard against unlawful imprisonment - but the White House is \"actively looking\" at pausing it.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the principle that a person should be able to challenge their detention in court.",
      "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, says the legal principle is a \"privilege\" that could be suspended to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants.",
      "Recent court challenges by migrants and dissenting students who have been held in immigration detention centres have cited habeas corpus as a reason for their release.",
      "But what the legal procedure does - and what could happen if it were to be suspended - is complex.",
      "What does habeas corpus mean?",
      "Scholars say the principle that a person should not be illegally imprisoned pre-dates the Magna Carta, and has been a cornerstone of the legal system in the UK, US and other democratic countries around the world for centuries.",
      "Roughly translated from Latin, habeas corpus means \"you should have the body\" - as in, a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained.",
      "Also known as the \"Great Writ of Liberty\", habeas corpus grants prisoners the right to challenge their imprisonment in a court of law.",
      "Is habeas corpus a right in the US Constitution?",
      "Article One of the US Constitution states that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\".",
      "While this is the only time habeas corpus is mentioned in the Constitution, it has become an important part of US law - and has frequently been fought over in the courts, including the US Supreme Court.",
      "Has habeas corpus been suspended before?",
      "Abraham Lincoln became the first US president to suspend habeas corpus in 1861, during the American Civil War.",
      "That led to a showdown with Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, who said it was Congress - not the executive branch of government - that had the power to suspend the writ.",
      "Lincoln continued to suspend habeas corpus in specific incidences, according to the National Constitution Center, and in 1863 Congress approved suspending it for the duration of the war when \"the public safety may require it\".",
      "It was also suspended several times in the years following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction period, to quash rebellions by the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group.",
      "After the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese in World War Two, habeas corpus was suspended in Hawaii, which paved the way for the arrest of Japanese Americans on the island.",
      "What do modern courts say about habeas corpus?",
      "The courts have found that both US citizens and non-citizens have the right to habeas corpus. In 2008, the US Supreme Court extended this to include non-citizens detained in a foreign prison - such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.",
      "But just because prisoners have the right to challenge their detention, it does not guarantee they will be able to leave custody.",
      "Succeeding with a habeas corpus petition is extremely rare - most people who are detained have been detained for lawful reasons, courts have generally found.",
      "Asadullah Haroon Gul was the first Guantanamo detainee to win a habeas corpus petition in 2021. He was transferred back to Afghanistan more than a decade after the US Supreme Court found that detainees had habeas corpus privileges.",
      "But as Trump's administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants and student dissenters, habeas corpus has received renewed legal interest.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants being deported under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act must be given enough notice of their removal to file petitions. It temporarily blocked some deportations in Texas for this reason.",
      "Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained after becoming a leading figure in pro-Palestinian campus protests, has filed his own habeas corpus petition, as he is in the middle of deportation hearings.",

      "As the trial is underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs is being tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",

      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs' lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",

      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",

      "TV, film and media executive Barry Diller spent a decade at ABC, where he helped popularize the made-for-TV \"Movie of the Week.\" In his new memoir, \"Who Knew\" (to be published on May 20 by Simon & Schuster), Diller writes about his career, including a lesson about the limitations of too much information \u2013 when instinct (for, like, what makes an intriguing Movie of the Week?) may be a better predictor of success.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tracy Smith's interview with Barry Diller on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" May 11!",
      "\"Who Knew\" by Barry Diller",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were good on titles in the early days",
      "Women in Chains was one of my favorites; it was a horrible movie, but what a promotable title.",
      "Scream, Pretty Peggy wasn't bad, either.",
      "Sometimes the staff would ask, \"Is it commercial?\" and I would brutalize them, because rather than using their instincts, they were trying to predict the public's appetite, which I said then and say now, over and over again, simply isn't possible. Neither is using research to help make decisions. No amount of research on ideas is worth the paper (or computer screen) it's printed on. Data can tell you what has happened, not what can or will happen.\u00a0Data is often harmful to instinct, and I believe this to be true for making not only creative decisions but many business decisions. PowerPoint can be the enemy; structured information often narrows the sieve just when you need to broaden it out in the spaces between information and real understanding. Overtraining our brains on data alone doesn't confer an advantage, and it can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component. That's often the problem with MBA students, who come armed with all the business tools and case studies but little simple human instinct. I do not believe that using instinct rather than deep, hard numerical or fact-based data to help with decision-making is the lazier process. Too much information can overload, overcomplicate, and obscure what is at the essence of any proposal: Is it a good idea, and does it make any common sense?",
      "You rarely get the perfect project or the perfect script. In all my experience I probably haven't read ten scripts out of a thousand that are so fully realized, so utterly and incontrovertibly great that you just scream, \"Make it!\" One of those, though, was the day in 1970 that Leonard Goldberg, who had recently moved on from ABC to run a large television production company, called up and said, \"You must read this script right now.\" It was called Brian's Song, the story of the deep bond between a Black and a white pro football player, one who will die of cancer. I wept as I read it. I called him up and said, \"We can only screw it up from here\u2014it's perfect\u2014let's go.\" Often referred to as one of the finest television films ever made\u2014and one of the greatest sports films as well\u2014it was nominated for nine Emmys and won five. Another of those few times, Dan Curtis, a leading ABC daytime producer, sent me a manuscript of an as-yet-unpublished novel called The Kolchak Papers. I read it in two or three hours\u2014it was the contemporary tale of a vampire in Las Vegas\u2014and I told Dan, \"This is as good a story as I've ever read.\" And what a great idea: Las Vegas, a city most alive at night\u2014the perfect place for a vampire to live.",
      "Out of that novel we made The Night Stalker, which turned out to be so good that we held a screening for the senior ABC management, who all said, \"That's a great movie. We should release it theatrically!\" I fought against that, saying, \"Yes, it's a great movie, but it's a Movie of the Week, and that's where it belongs.\" We aired the film in early January 1972, and it became ABC's highest-rated Movie of the Week, drawing about 50 million people, a record. The Night Stalker spawned a sequel (The Night Strangler) and a television series (Kolchak: The Night Stalker), and it was followed by two more made-for-TV movies and a subsequent remake of the series. All that from one good idea!",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 10:14:20 -0400",
    "summary": "In his combination business memoir and personal journey, the former media exec opens up about topics he had vowed never to talk about, including his early relations with men, as well as his decades-long relationship with designer Diane von Furstenberg.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, a few steps from Manhattan's Little Island, the people enjoying sunshine on the High Line took little notice of the man who helped create this corner of the world, the legendary businessman Barry Diller.",
      "\"When you're up here, even though you're not up very high, you really are elevated, [with] a totally different perspective of the city,\" Diller said.",
      "Talk about different perspectives: At 83, Diller himself is now inviting people to take another look at him. Next week he'll release his memoir, more than ten years in the making. In \"Who Knew\" he names plenty of names, tells wild stories, and bares his soul about things he says he'd vowed never to talk about in public.",
      "In his preface he writes, \"When I was young, I was far too afraid. I'm no longer that. And I'm too old to care.\"",
      "Afraid of what? \"I was afraid of secrets being revealed,\" he said. \"I was afraid of, I thought I didn't qualify. I think, just afraid of revealing myself.\"",
      "Diller says he was in grade school when he first realized he might be gay. \"Eleven or twelve years old, or 13, I got on my bike, and I rode down to the Beverly Hills Public Library. And I looked for books on homosexuality. And everything I read was, like, horrible. And I got on my bike and I rode home and thought, I'm a condemned person. I mean, for a little kid, that's not great.\"",
      "He had his first sexual encounter at age 16. I asked, \"Did you tell your friends? Did you tell anybody about it?\"",
      "\"Of course not! Are you kidding? I didn't tell myself,\" Diller replied. \"I mean, I thought \u2013 oh, what did I think? I thought, Oh, I did that. I don't have to do it again.\"",
      "\"I did this thing with a guy, but that's the end of it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I don't need to do that again,\" Diller said. \"And then a month later, I did. And then I knew.\"",
      "But at the time, he thought it best to keep it a secret. He vowed never to lie about it, only to keep it quiet. He writes that, through his life, his sexuality was like an \"anvil on a wire\" hanging over his head. \"Yes, because I was afraid,\" he said. \"Listen, this is in the '60s and '70s. Well, I think probably I was being realistic that, first of all, my sexuality was confused. And I thought, Well, if I reveal it, what am I actually gonna reveal?",
      "\"I didn't want to risk what a lot of other people had risked, even at that time. I mean, talking about homosexuality, talking about bi-, whatever sexuality is, was something that scared the hell out of me,\" he said.",
      "In private, Diller lived in fear of being found out, but in public he was one of the gutsiest leaders in the game. As a junior executive at ABC, he pioneered the highly-successful movie of the week, and later created the even-more successful TV miniseries, with landmark events such as \"Roots.\"",
      "When \"Roots\" first aired in 1977, more than half the U.S. population tuned in. \"You really were having 30 to 40 to 50,000,000 people watching at one time, 'cause there was of course no recorder,\" he said. \"It was appointment viewing. And everyone in America came to the appointment.\"",
      "And then, the man who conquered TV went to the movies, becoming, at age 32, head of Paramount.",
      "Did he feel like he belonged? \"Oh my God, no,\" he said. \"When I became chairman of Paramount \u2013 and I was this kid from television, of all things \u2013 it was like, 'How in God's name did that happen? That is an accident of history that will be quickly corrected.'\"",
      "But the kid from TV knew how to tell a good story, and gave the green light to a string of films that have since become classics, like 1977's \"Saturday Night Fever.\"",
      "It was during those early days at Paramount that Diller met fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. Interestingly, they didn't click at first. \"Yeah, the first time I met her, I never wanted to see her again, 'cause she was dismissive of me and whatever,\" he said. \"But then, the second time that we met, which was a few months later, within minutes, it was pure desire.\"",
      "\"It was a steamy romance,\" I said.",
      "\"Yes. Oh, yes, it was those things.\"",
      "\"And you make it clear \u2013 I mean, I'll just put it out there \u2013 your relationship with Diane is not just platonic.\"",
      "\"No. No. It didn't start that, no, no, no, no.\"",
      "\"You're lovers.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"It seems to me like one of the points you're trying to make in the book is that it doesn't have to be a mutually-exclusive thing \u2013 that you can be in love with Diane and, at the same time, be attracted to men?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Diller. \"I don't see anything mutually exclusive with that, no. I mean, other people may, but I don't. If I know that the person cares about me, I'm not jealous of anything else. So, that's just luck, I guess.\"",
      "Diller says he owes much of his professional success to luck as well. And he has had a lot of it: In the '80s, as the chairman of Fox, he created a fourth TV network, Homer Simpson and all.",
      "Asked if he gets bored by success, Diller replied, \"Yes, definitely. I mean, once it's there, what are you going to do with it?\"",
      "In the '90s, Diller switched gears again, investing in home shopping, and eventually scooping up a bunch of internet businesses that became household names, like Expedia and Match.com.",
      "And in-between, he and Furstenberg helped create the High Line, donating their time and tens of millions of dollars. \"It doesn't cure cancer,\" he said. \"It's not going to change the dynamics of the world, eradicate disease, or whatever. But it brings pleasure to people.\"",
      "He says he has a similar goal with this book: to share a good story. And that means telling the truth \u2013 to finally let go of a secret he's been holding onto for a lifetime.",
      "I asked, \"You do touch on these feelings of, Maybe I was wrong?\"",
      "\"I don't know that I was wrong about not talking about my private life; I think I was a coward,\" Diller said. \"And I don't like that. But that is the truth. I was. I did not have \u2013 and I wish I did \u2013 I did not have the courage, at that time, to make declarations.\"",
      "\"Does that weigh on you?\"",
      "\"I wouldn't call it weighing on me,\" he said, \"but it is something that, of course, I've thought \u2026\"\u00a0 He paused. \"But it didn't turn out so terribly.\"",
      "The same might be said of his personal life, too: Diller and von Furstenberg were married in 2001, and they're as strong as ever.",
      "He calls his relationship with her the bedrock of his life. \"Well, I don't know any better description than bedrock,\" Diller said. \"The best times for us are when it's just us. And after almost 50 years, how lucky do you get?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 09:39:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated actress talks about playing the activist whose 1990s lawsuit demanding equal pay with her male colleagues went all the way to the Supreme Court, and how her own mother inspired her performance.",
    "story": [
      "If you don't know the name Lilly Ledbetter, how's this for an introduction? \"Lilly Ledbetter did not set out to be a trailblazer or a household name,\" said President Obama in 2009. \"She was a good hard worker who did her job, and she did it well for nearly two decades before discovering that for years she was paid less than her male colleagues for doing the very same work.\" Forty percent less, by most accounts.",
      "Now, a new film, \"Lilly,\" starring Patricia Clarkson, chronicles Ledbetter's David-and-Goliath-type fight for equal pay against her employer, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, in Alabama.",
      "Asked what she knew about Ledbetter before reading the script, Clarkson replied, \"Well, that she was one of the most remarkable human beings ever put on this Earth, a true, true American hero. A grave injustice had been committed against her. But she was also dealing with misogyny, ageism. But yet, she was this amazing manager. She rose.\"",
      "A female manager at a tire factory in the 1970s was almost unheard of. But Ledbetter needed the money to help her husband support their two kids. In 1998, she found a list of names and salaries of her male counterparts, all of whom made far more than she did.",
      "As the movie depicts, Ledbetter found an anonymous note, left for her in her locker, that detailed the pay discrepancies. \"And she was devastated,\" said her daughter, Vickie Ledbetter Saxon. \"She told me she didn't know how she was going to get through the shift. She was humiliated.\"",
      "Ledbetter filed suit, and was awarded $3.8 million in back pay and damages. But a court of appeals overturned the verdict. She never saw a dime.",
      "Her case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where a 5-4 ruling in favor of Goodyear stated that she had waited too long to file a discrimination claim (the statute of limitations was just 180 days).",
      "\"She was extremely devastated by that,\" said Saxon. \"And I thought it was over, I really did.\"",
      "It wasn't. By then, Ledbetter was nearly 70, and became a symbol of unequal treatment in the workplace. She made it her life's mission to correct pay disparity, and she maintained her activism well into her 80s.",
      "In a speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2008, Ledbetter said, \"Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental American principle.\"",
      "On January 29, 2009, President Obama signed his first piece of legislation: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which effectively ended the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims.",
      "Clarkson said, \"People care about her journey. It's like: I get you. I know who the hell you are. I know what you went through. I've been through it, too. And whether you're a man or a woman or you're Black or White or young or old, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, whether you were gay or straight, everybody struggles in this way.\"",
      "Clarkson has played a string of memorable characters, from a heroin addict in \"High Art,\" to the mom in \"Easy A.\" She says Hollywood is no exception.",
      "Asked if she believes she was paid equally throughout her career, Clarkson replied, \"Oh, no. Oh, no. No. When I was first working, I was paid scale, which is just the barest of minimum. Young men in the movie with me who had the same amount of words or scenes that I had were making a salary. But I was being paid scale. I didn't know that I was making way less to the dollar. But not anymore, baby!\"",
      "Clarkson says to become Lilly, she spent time in a New York City park: \"Every time I went somewhere, or I just would walk around the street, I was like, 'That's Lilly, that's Lilly, that's Lilly.' I mean, everybody, she's everywhere.\"",
      "She especially found Lilly in her own mother, Jackie Clarkson, a New Orleans City Councilwoman and Louisiana state representative. \"What I brought forth was the best of me, my mother, to play Lilly, because I had this shining example,\" she said. \"It's very hard for me to watch 'Lilly.' My mother is there. My mother is a very kindred spirit with Lilly.\"",
      "When she got the part, her mom was her first call. \"You know, 'cause I've played a lot of complicated women, and she was like, 'Oh, Patty. Oh, Patty. This is so glorious. This is wonderful. You're finally gonna be in a movie everybody can see!'\"",
      "Clarkson says playing Ledbetter is the privilege of her life.",
      "Asked what she learned about herself by playing Lilly, Clarkson said, \"I need to always strive to care more, to be better, to try to be a better human being, to be a better citizen.\"",
      "I said, \"I think an experience that one has watching this film and seeing her story is to think, 'Would I rise to the occasion over and over? If I were called upon, would I be that brave?'\"",
      "\"I don't know that I would,\" said Clarkson. \"If I had lost the settlement, I would have been like, 'I'm done.'\"",
      "Both Jackie Clarkson and Ledbetter died last year. Lilly Ledbetter screened the film just days before her death, before Clarkson could meet her.",
      "Asked what she would say to Ledbetter if she could, Clarkson replied, \"You lived an exceptional life with very little. And that people can be exceptional with very little. My mother was, too. They're gonna be dancing. Happy Mother's Day, Lilly, Mom!\"",

      "It was her night once again. Lainey Wilson took home the top prize at the 60th annual Academy of Country Music Awards\u00a0\u2014 the title of entertainer of the year \u2014 for a second year in a row. And that was after she cleaned house, taking home trophies for both female artist and album of the year.",
      "\"I really do have the best fans in the world,\" she said in her final acceptance speech, admitting to experiencing impostor syndrome. \"I dreamed about entertaining. ... Country music has given me more than I deserve.\"",
      "Beyond Wilson's dominance, the 2025 ACM Awards were packed with celebration. Earlier, first-time and leading nominee Ella Langley's duet with Riley Green, the ubiquitous \"You Look Like You Love Me,\" was named single and music event of the year.",
      "Both Langley and Green used their first acceptance speech to shout out classic country \u2014 songs with talking in them \u2014 that inspired their modern hit.",
      "A revisitation of the past might have been a theme Thursday night, evidenced right at the top of the ceremony: a 14-minute medley of six decades of country classics, performed by giants of the genre.",
      "Host Reba McEntire launched into Merle Haggard's \"Okie from Muskogee,\" followed by Clint Black with Glen Campbell's \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" and Wynonna Judd with The Judds' \"Why Not Me.\" LeAnn Rimes returned to the ACM Awards stage for her 1997 ballad \"Blue.\" Little Big Town tackled their 2014 track \"Girl Crush\" and Dan + Shay delivered their \"Tequila.\"",

      "Actor Michael Pitt, known for his TV roles on \"Boardwalk Empire\" and \"Dawson's Creek,\" is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend, choking her, and attacking her with a cinder block and a piece of lumber at his New York City home, according to a grand jury indictment.",
      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts, including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment.",
      "Pitt's lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt \u2014 an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes \u2014 can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\" Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "He added, \"In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\"",
      "Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done.",
      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of lumber.",
      "The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021.",
      "TMZ reported in 2022 that Pitt was arrested in Brooklyn for allegedly punching a man after taking his phone and, two months later, was brought to a hospital under police escort after a public outburst\u00a0in New York.",
      "Pitt, who grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, played the character Jimmy Darmody for two seasons on HBO's \"Boardwalk Empire,\" with the cast led by Steve Buscemi winning Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2011 and 2012 for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The show also won\u00a0a Golden Globe for best drama series in 2011.",
      "His first major role came in the 2001 film \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\" In 2005, he starred in \"Last Days,\" director Gus Van Sant's film about a fictional rock star inspired by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He also played Henry Parker in one season of The WB's \"Dawson's Creek\" in 1999-2000.",

      "The use of AI in sensitive fields such as medicine has brought up concerns of privacy violations, and OpenAI said it is collaborating with universities and medical schools like Mount Sinai to ensure robust safeguards are in place to protect students and patients.",

It helps them to discover new areas of knowledge. It helps them to explore more deeply. What we're really focused on is making sure that there is equitable access to AI.\"",
      "Belsky equated the impact of AI in the 21st century workplace to that of email and internet access in the 1990s.",

    "story": [
      "A bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric will go public this year, the company announced Monday, deepening the Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency.",
      "American Bitcoin \u2014 which lists Eric Trump as its co-founder and has its roots in a company backed by Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 is merging with the publicly-traded Gryphon Digital Mining. The all-stock transaction will allow the firm backed by the Trump brothers to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The merger is expected to close as early as the third quarter of this year.",
      "The company's goals, according to an overview posted Monday, are to mine new bitcoin \"below market cost\" and to build up a reserve of the cryptocurrency.",
      "\"Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,\" Eric Trump said in a statement.",
      "American Bitcoin was launched in March, with crypto mining firm Hut 8 owning a majority stake. At the time, the company said it \"aims to become the world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner.\" It's the successor to American Data Centers, a venture backed by Eric Trump, his older brother Donald Trump Jr. and publicly traded Dominari Holdings.",
      "Crypto mining also has a stamp of approval from Eric and Donald Trump Jr.'s father. The president pledged to make the United States a \"bitcoin mining powerhouse\" last year.",
      "What is bitcoin mining \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors \u2014 known as miners \u2014 who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. As a reward for this work, miners earn units of bitcoin for crunching the numbers successfully.",
      "The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor.",
      "But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt.",
      "Trump family's crypto empire grows",
      "The Trump brothers' foray into bitcoin mining marks the family's latest crypto venture. The president and his two eldest sons are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which got a multi-billion dollar boost earlier this month from an Abu Dhabi-based firm, and Mr. Trump launched a highly volatile \"meme coin\" called $TRUMP in January.",
      "Crypto investments make up about $2.9 billion of the family's net worth, one report estimates.",
      "The Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency has drawn criticism for conflicts of interest. Last week, Senate Democrats blocked a crypto regulation bill from moving forward and pushed for it to include new limits on elected officials participating in some types of crypto ventures, with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of \"crypto corruption.\"",
      "The White House has pushed back on the criticism. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said last week Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",

The agreement was struck over the weekend in Switzerland, where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Administrator Jamieson Greer\u00a0met with a Chinese trade delegation.",
      "Starting May 14, both countries will lower tariffs by 115%, according to the White House. That will bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% from as high as 145%, and China's rate on American goods down to 10% from 125%. The 10% baseline tariff and other U.S. measures will remain in place.",

      "Still, the Trump administration's success in striking an agreement with China \u2014 which was viewed as one of the more difficult agreements to negotiate \u2014 paves a smoother road ahead for Wall Street investors.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0reached a deal\u00a0with the U.K. last week, the first trade pact to be announced since so-called \"Liberation Day.\" Mr. Trump introduced the 10% tariff baseline on most imports on April 2, which remains in place.",
      "\"The market is going to take great comfort in the idea that there is a way forward and that all-time highs in the stock market are achievable before yearend,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a research note.",
      "The news also eased fears that the tariffs could tip the U.S. into a serious slump. Oxford Economics dropped their odds of\u00a0 a recession this year to 35%, citing the tariff truce. Still, they maintained a conservative outlook.",

Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12\u00a0statement about the new bill.",
      "The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on.",
      "\"Community engagement requirement\"",
      "Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",
      "If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029.",
      "Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking to tighten these rules for the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\"",
      "Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so.",
      "About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recent\u00a0analysis from heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit.",
      "And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 17:07:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Since the pandemic, the monthly rent for a typical apartment around the U.S. has surged almost 30% to $1,858, Zillow data shows.",
    "story": [
      "With home prices near a record high and mortgage rates remaining elevated, renting a place to live around the U.S. is today considered a\u00a0better alternative to buying. But here's the catch: Rents are surging, too.",
      "Zillow calculates\u00a0that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental \u2014 up from $60,000 in 2020. And if you want to live in a larger urban area, apartment hunters now need to earn $100,000 or more to live in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, while even modestly sized Riverside, California, requires six figures for people to keep their heads above water, according to the real estate firm.",
      "\"Today renters need to make six figures to afford the typical rental in eight major metropolitan areas \u2014twice as many as before the pandemic,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"That means renters have less money in their budgets for essentials like groceries and transportation, or for saving for a down payment.\"",
      "The typical guidance is to spend no more than 30% of your income on rent. To put that in perspective, that's $2,500 a month for someone making $100,000. To stay below the 30% threshold, renters in the eight cities listed by Zillow need to make at least six figures.",
      "\"This Zillow data backs up what every renter has been feeling when they've been looking for an apartment or trying to renew their lease,\" said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \"Not just in New York City, but across the country, the cost of housing is skyrocketing and they just can't keep up.\"",
      "Here's a look at where around the country you need to earn six figures to afford the rent \u2014 plus cities where you might be able to get away with a lower salary.",
      "Most and least expensive",
      "It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said.",
      "The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillow\u00a0data. The city is doing away with broker fees starting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search.",
      "The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow.",
      "Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston \u2013 or around $55,000.",
      "Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to the\u00a0Census Bureau.",
      "At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even with\u00a0hundreds of thousands of apartments being constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand.",
      "\"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\"",
      "Fee added that to increase the supply of affordable housing and overall inventory, Congress needs to take action by expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which subsidizes affordable housing.",
      "\"Renters across the country are looking to Washington for relief, and Congress has yet to take any meaningful action to increase affordable housing supply,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of the tariffs imposed over the last couple months, the countries said in a joint statement shared by the White House, heralding significant success in trade negotiations that ramped up over the weekend.",
      "In the joint statement released early Monday morning, the two sides said they had agreed that ongoing \"discussions\u00a0have the potential to address the concerns of each side in their economic and trade relationship,\" and that \"moving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect,\" both parties had committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April.",
      "\"We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he spent the weekend in meetings with Chinese counterparts. He said Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to give the negotiations room to move forward.",
      "Bessent said the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. That could include resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries, according to High Frequency Economics.",
      "At the White House, President Trump hailed the agreement while speaking to reporters before leaving for the Middle East.",
      "\"The biggest thing that we're discussing is the opening up China, and they've agreed to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But it's going to take a while to paper it.\"",
      "The White House's imposition of levies amounting to some 145% on all goods imported from China, and Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports, had cast a long shadow over global financial markets as the world's two biggest economies spent the early spring appearing to entrench in a trade war.",
      "The high tariffs had virtually frozen trade between the U.S. and China, with major American ports reporting a drastic drop in traffic.",
      "\"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" Bessent told reporters in Geneva on Monday. \"And what had occurred with these very high tariff ... was an embargo, the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balanced trade. And I think that both sides are committed to achieving that.\"",
      "In another sign that the U.S. may be ready to relent on its protectionist trade policies, Mr. Trump on May 8 announced a pact with the United Kingdom under which the U.S. will lower tariffs on British cars from 27.5% to 10%, while also scrapping levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Stock market boost",
      "Commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond were buoyed significantly on the news of a breakthrough in the negotiations on Monday. Stock futures in the U.S. also soared, with the Dow gaining more than 1,000 points ahead of trade opening in New York on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.2% and 4%, respectively.",
      "Speaking Sunday, Bessent said there had been \"substantial progress\" in the talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, while Greer teased that an agreement had been reached but offered no details.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer told reporters on Sunday.",
      "Despite the cooldown, some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the truce will last and if the sides are committed to forging a more permanent agreement to ease tensions.",
      "Bessent \"stated that neither the U.S. nor China wants decoupling. We are skeptical,\" Wei Yao, head of research Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Group. \"To us, the thinking on reducing reliance on China for the supply of critical material seems more permanent, even though the U.S. may not mind continuing to buy clothes, toys or even iPhones from China.\"",

To produce enough inventory, she took out a loan from the Small Business Administration. \"That loan is partially SBA-financed, and then partially leveraged against my house,\" Benike said. \"So, if I can't stay in business and pay those loans, I lose the house.\"",
      "Inside Benike's warehouse, this is what's left:",
      "Once this inventory is sold, Benike said, \"then we're out of product. Then we're sold out. We've got nothing more coming in.\"",
      "One of the retailers Benike supplies is Little Roo's, in Chaska, Minnesota. Owner Marissa Held-Nordling says she has seen shopper behavior change since tariffs were introduced. For the first time ever, she is allowing customers to stockpile baby registry gifts, like Benike's Busy Baby mats. That way, family and friends can still get what they need, often for baby showers months away.",
      "\"You can't just do a registry anymore, because the products aren't guaranteed that it's still going to be on the shelf,\" said Held-Nordling. \"So, at this point I'm allowing people to come in and fill a bin, and they can get their exact colors \u2026 and then I close the bin and I take this product off my website.\"",
      "While the U.S. and China begin trade talks, economists still expect most goods to get more expensive \u2013 or even go out of stock, from clothing to electronics to toys. Yale's Budget Lab says tariffs could add nearly $5,000 a year to families' household expenses.",

      "Trump says there are no tariff exceptions in his trade war, despite electronics exemptions",
      "Kyla Scanlon, an economic analyst and author of \"In This Economy? How Money & Markets Really Work,\" said, \"It's probably a smart time to take advantage of this weird, uncertain moment to make sure that you have what you need, just in case prices do get more expensive. If you don't need something right away, a lot of financial advisors would recommend that you do start padding your emergency fund, and putting some money to the side.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are these tariffs necessary to rebalance the global economy?\"",
      "\"I don't think this was necessary,\" Scanlon laughed. \"Targeted tariffs are okay. But when you do broad, blanket tariffs on everything, and when the rate is confusing, when small businesses don't know how to invest, they don't know what they should be spending money on \u2013 it's just not a good economic environment.\"",
      "The legality of the Trump administration sidestepping Congress to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. President Trump says he imposed these tariffs in part to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "Small business owner challenges Trump tariffs in court",
      "Small business owner challenges Trump tariffs in court",
      "When asked on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" if there were discussions about giving relief to small businesses, Trump replied, \"They're not going to need it. They're gonna make so much money, if you build your product here.\"",
      "But Benike says that's impossible \u2013 that manufacturing her products in the U.S. is too expensive: \"The cost of land is higher here. The cost of insurance, the building, electricity, employees. And these factories that are producing now in the U.S., the raw materials they're bringing in are being tariffed as well.\"",
      "It's an untenable situation, even for someone as successful as Benike. Just last week, she was recognized for her company's success \u2013 while she worried about its survival.",
      "\"I was in D.C. to receive my Small Business Person of the Year Award at the fanciest hotel in D.C., with my son in his adorable little suit and bow tie,\" she said. \"And I just sat there feeling defeated. Where I would've loved to have celebrated that, now I have to prove it.\"",
      "Still, she's not giving up. She's drawing inspiration from a phrase she picked up in the military: Improvise, adapt and overcome.",
      "\"So, Plan B is figuring out how to become a global brand,\" she said.",
      "\"And not sell in the United States?\" I asked.",
      "\"For now,\" Benike said, adding, \"It'll come back some day.\"",
      "\"You have faith?\"",

      "The CPSC is an independent agency that regulates the safety of consumer products, from toys to appliances. It's the group that often handles recalls of items such as kitchen ranges that can set fires and steam cleaners that have burned users.",
      "In his statement, Trumka said he was given no reason for his firing, but that his dismissal came after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to work at the agency. Trumka, who was appointed to a 7-year term by President Biden in 2021, said he pushed back against DOGE because \"if these people are allowed in to govern our agency, they will gut it and the result will turn back the clock on product safety.\"",

They asked if we would allow them to implant at  our agency. They asked for our answer to that by 6 p.m. We said 'no.' And moments later, we were fired by email from the president.\"",

      "\"The Consumer Product Safety Commission makes sure toys are safe for our kids and the products Americans use everyday don't have hidden hazards,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"It conducts thousands of investigations and issues crucial recalls .... This move is dangerous and illegal.\"",
      "DOGE firings",
      "DOGE has sought to cut federal workers in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse. But many of its firings have had to be reversed, either because the group mistakenly fired essential workers \u2014 like bird-flu experts with the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 or after a court ruled the dismissals were illegal.",

Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, according to the April data, demonstrating how Mr. Trump's tariffs are already upending trade patterns.",

      "While lower than the 145% tariffs currently in place, 80% levies would still make importing goods from China prohibitively expensive for many U.S.-based businesses.

    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",

Currently, an import duty of up to 145% applies to U.S. imports from China, where the vast majority of strollers sold in the U.S. are made.",

      "Although the midsize company, based in Portland, Oregon, operates in an industry that is highly exposed to tariffs, Keen tells customers that it will keep prices steady this year no matter how tariffs affect its costs. That's no idle pledge calculated to preserve market share \u2014 Keen has been steadily retooling the business for years to protect itself from sudden shifts in global trade and the vagaries of geopolitics.",
      "\"We have been preparing for this for over a decade. Early on, we saw the risks of being overdependent on any one country, so we made the decision to diversify our supply chain well beyond China,\" Chief Operating Officer Hari Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 22-year-old company, with 650 U.S. employees and owned by design and brand management company Fuerst Group, has worked to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing while expanding its U.S. presence and diversifying its supply chains.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are upending retailer supply chains, forcing them to devise workarounds. That can mean moving manufacturing to another foreign country with lower tariffs or investing in U.S.-based production. For small businesses, tariff-driven uncertainty\u00a0can mean shutting operations down altogether when the financials no longer add up.",
      "Shoe and clothing prices could soar",
      "Footwear companies are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval caused by President Trump's trade war, given their reliance on China, where 36%, or $9.8 billion's worth, of imported footwear sold in the U.S. is made, according to a TD Cowen analysis of international trade data.",
      "For that reason, tariffs are expected to hit footwear and apparel companies hard, and that impact will be felt by American consumers as well, according to Jason Judd, a global supply-chain expert and executive director of Cornell University's Global Labor Institute.",
      "In 2023, U.S. households spent an average of about $1,700 per year on footwear and apparel, Judd said. He expects that figure to surge 70% in the short term, to $2,800 per family, because of tariff-related price hikes. In the coming years, meanwhile, consumers are still likely to be paying more for footwear and clothing because of higher global tariffs.",
      "\"That pain will lessen as terms and sourcing patterns change, but the longer-term costs per family will still be around a $425 increase per year.\"",
      "The abrupt change in tariff policies is already rippling across the industry. German sportswear giant Adidas last month warned U.S. customers that \"cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.\" And retailers across various industries, from apparel to food, have started passing some of the cost from higher import taxes to consumers in the form of\u00a0\"tariff surcharges.\"",
      "\"We saw the writing on the wall\"",
      "Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production. It also contracts with manufacturing partners in Cambodia, India and Vietnam, all of which are subject to impending new U.S. levies. Cambodia faces a country-specific tariff rate of 49%, while Vietnam and India face levies of 47% and 27%, respectively.",
      "\"We do have 10% exposure in those countries, but the 10% tariff we're dealing with is significantly lower than what other companies are facing on products that would come out of China,\" Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Back in 2015, executives at Keen were already taking note of rising labor costs in China. Today, the company's broad supply chain helps it spread costs across the company, its manufacturing partners and their suppliers, he said. Keen, which is privately held, declined to share information on its annual revenues.",
      "\"We are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, but that's shared by our partners,\" he said. \"They share some of the costs with us, then they go to the company they buy materials from, and those tier-one suppliers share some of the costs as well.\"",

      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",

      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",

      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal.",
      "\"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\"",
      "\"That's a low number,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"Many, some will be much higher.\"",
      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump claims that other countries and exporters to the U.S. will largely pick up the cost of tariffs. Yet recent data shows that companies are moving to pass along those added expenses to American consumers, which may push up prices.",
      "For example, 76% of Texas manufacturers said they plan to pass tariff-related costs to consumers, while 50% say they will absorb costs internally, according to recent\u00a0survey data\u00a0from Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Large retailers have also warned that steep new levies on U.S. imports are likely to drive up prices.",
      "\"The bottom line is that inflation will be rising significantly over the next six months,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Indeed, with businesses having to plan months in advance to account for tariffs, many companies are baking those costs into their pricing. In a recent EY survey of over 4,000 executives, two-thirds of respondents said they might have to pass tariff costs on to customers.",
      "The Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute based in Washington, D.C., notes that the economic fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs will fall largely on low- and middle-income consumers. The levies could cost households an average of $5,200 every year,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Inflation ahead?",
      "Manufacturers expect their prices to increase 3.6% over the next 12 months, up from 2.3% in the last quarter of 2024, according to a recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, which cites manufacturers' concerns over trade.",
      "\"Nobody has the profitability to be able to eat the tariffs,\" David Loftus, CEO of the Electronic Component Industry Association, an industry trade group, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So the manufacturers pass to the distributors, who pass to the customers.\"",
      "A recent\u00a0Gallup poll found that nearly 90% of Americans expect tariffs to drive up prices this year. For now, tariffs have yet to budge prices \u2014 the Consumer Price Index in March\u00a0rose 2.4% on an annual basis, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Yet many experts say that U.S. tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to boost consumer prices in the months ahead.",
      "\"With the new tariffs now in place, we look for a shift up in inflation, adding a headwind to already slowing consumer activity and economic growth,\" Nationwide economist Daniel Vielhaber told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, which tracks consumer spending, to rise this year to 3.8%, up from 2.6% in March. Electronics and apparel are likely to see the sharpest price increases, according to the investment bank.",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump has staunchly defended the tariffs as a way to restore what he calls fairness to global trade, reinvigorate U.S. manufacturers and generate federal revenues. When asked in a May 4 interview on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0\"Meet the Press\" whether higher duties on imports will drive up prices, he replied, \"No. I think tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich.\"",
      "The president has also doubled down on his messaging that foreign exporters, not U.S. consumers, will absorb higher tariff costs. \"China probably will eat those tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said in an April 29\u00a0interview\u00a0with ABC News about the U.S. imposing tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has seemingly acknowledged that stepped-up tariffs could result in higher costs for some goods, such as toys. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said in an\u00a0April 30 Cabinet meeting. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"",
      "Some companies already hiking prices",
      "After Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of other nations, a flurry of companies across a range of industries have announced that they will increase prices to offset higher costs.",
      "For example, power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said in an April 30 earnings\u00a0call that they implemented a \"single-digit\" price increase on retail partners that month and that they're eyeing another price increase for later in the year.",
      "\"Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter,\" Chief Operating Officer Christopher Nelson said on the call.",
      "The CEO of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Old Spice, Tampax and other household brands, told CNBC\u00a0last month that price hikes are \"likely\" due to the uncertainty of tariffs. Adidas CEO Bjorn Goulden also told analysts in an April earnings call that there will be price increases in the U.S. market if U.S. duties on imported goods remain in place.",
      "\"So should the duties go away, again, there will, of course, not be price increases,\" he said. \"But I think we all agree that should these duties stay or even be higher, then, of course, it will cause a price increase in the market in general, not only in our category.\"",
      "Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu said in April that they planned to hike their prices, citing the U.S. eliminating a tariff loophole\u00a0for lower-cost goods. Relatedly, Temu has stopped shipping Chinese-made goods to customers in the U.S. following the May 2 expiration of the so-called de minimis exemption.",

      "In a press conference yesterday, Powell articulated the Fed's reasoning for holding steady, including that economic data \u2014 for now \u2014 shows that the U.S. is in relatively good shape. The Fed chair also noted that its policymakers want to hold off on making any moves until the effects of Mr. Trump's economic policies become clearer, such as the impact of his broad tariffs on inflation and economic growth.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday inaccurately claimed there is \"virtually NO INFLATION.\" Inflation rose 2.4% on an annual basis in March, which reflects a cooler pace than in the prior months yet is still above the Fed's stated goal of reaching a 2% annual pace.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants to launch a U.S. sovereign wealth fund \u2014 but the administration is still debating the mechanics of the fund.",
    "story": [
      "Top advisers have sent President Trump a plan to create a government-run investment fund, a request the president made earlier this year \u2014 but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal, CBS News has learned.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Trump has teased a \"very big announcement\" before he leaves for the Middle East next week, but it's unrelated to the proposed sovereign wealth fund, two sources said. \"It's going to be a truly earth-shattering and positive development for this country and for the people of this country,\" he said in the Oval Office on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources with an aim to make returns that would provide a public windfall. Some of the best-known funds are financed by revenue from gas or oil, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. These funds can help insulate countries from swings in the value of natural resources, provide funds for government expenditures and allow future generations to benefit from current oil and gas revenue.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that directed the Treasury and Commerce secretaries, in close coordination with the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett, to draft a plan for the sovereign wealth fund within 90 days.",
      "\"Such plan shall include recommendations for funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model,\" the order stated. \"The plan shall also include an evaluation of the legal considerations for establishing and managing such a fund, including any need for legislation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, who is in the country without authorization, was taken into ICE custody earlier this month after a May 5 traffic stop in Dalton, where she lives with her family. Local police cited her for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton, where she was picked up by ICE officers.",
      "But the Dalton Police Department and the city's prosecutor announced on Monday they had reviewed dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop and determined that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Officials said the vehicle that made the improper turn was similar to the truck Arias Cristobal was driving.",

      "In a statement before Monday's announcement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, called Arias Cristobal an \"illegal alien\" who had \"admitted to illegally entering the United States.\" McLaughlin said Arias Cristobal's father, Arias Tovar, \"self-admitted that he is in the country illegally.\"",
      "Federal officials have not disputed that Arias Cristobal and her father lack criminal records.",
      "\"[The] family will be able to return to Mexico together,\" McLaughlin said in her statement. \"Mr. Tovar had ample opportunity to seek a legal pathway to citizenship. He chose not to. We are not ignoring the rule of law.\"",

He said local officials notified her lawyers of the dismissed charges but did not alert ICE.",
      "\"It's a very regrettable place that we are right here, that we've ended up in this place with the way this unfolded and the way it turned out,\" Crosser said, adding that an internal review of the incident is ongoing.",
      "Arias Cristobal's lawyers said their client is likely to remain in ICE custody for now, even after the dismissal of the charges, since federal officials are holding her because she's in the U.S. without legal permission. They said she has a bond hearing scheduled for next week.",

      "A CMS spokesperson was not able to immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about how the agency was determining which drugmakers to approach and what the pricing would be.",
      "White House officials said ahead of the announcement that they were looking for price reductions in drug costs across both federal and private health insurance, not just Medicare. No specific class of drugs is being targeted, they said, but they are planning to focus on drugs with the biggest disparity between U.S. and foreign prices.",
      "Americans pay significantly more than citizens of other countries do for many of the same pharmaceutical drugs. Experts have blamed it on a range of factors, including a complex web of insurers, middlemen and providers that underpin the U.S. health care system, unlike other countries, which set prices through government-run health care systems.",

      "\"Applying other countries' antiquated approach to how they value \u2014 and pay \u2014 for medicines will stall investment across America's biotech companies, risk access to vital treatments and cures for millions of American patients, and lead to fewer American jobs,\" John F. Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, said in a statement Monday.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry argued that Mr. Trump's 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \"upper hand\" in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines.",
      "\"To lower costs for Americans, we need to address the real reasons U.S. prices are higher: foreign countries not paying their fair share and middlemen driving up prices for U.S. patients,\" Stephen J. Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement.",
      "Ubl said \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for patients and workers. However, he praised the White House for ordering the U.S. Trade Representative to address \"freeloading on American-financed innovation.\"",
      "\"The administration is right to use trade negotiations to force foreign governments to pay their fair share for medicines. U.S. patients should not foot the bill for global innovation,\" Ubl said.",

      "Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, did not address that Mr. Trump also pledged to \"cut out the middlemen\" as part of his new order, calling on HHS to create a way for Americans to buy medications directly from drugmakers at the most favored nation price.",
      "\"We should look at every avenue to get drug companies to lower list prices.

    "summary": "The president's son Eric Trump says he wants to create \"the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market.\"",
    "story": [
      "A bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric will go public this year, the company announced Monday, deepening the Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency.",
      "American Bitcoin \u2014 which lists Eric Trump as its co-founder and has its roots in a company backed by Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 is merging with the publicly-traded Gryphon Digital Mining. The all-stock transaction will allow the firm backed by the Trump brothers to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The merger is expected to close as early as the third quarter of this year.",
      "The company's goals, according to an overview posted Monday, are to mine new bitcoin \"below market cost\" and to build up a reserve of the cryptocurrency.",
      "\"Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,\" Eric Trump said in a statement.",
      "American Bitcoin was launched in March, with crypto mining firm Hut 8 owning a majority stake. At the time, the company said it \"aims to become the world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner.\" It's the successor to American Data Centers, a venture backed by Eric Trump, his older brother Donald Trump Jr. and publicly traded Dominari Holdings.",
      "Crypto mining also has a stamp of approval from Eric and Donald Trump Jr.'s father. The president pledged to make the United States a \"bitcoin mining powerhouse\" last year.",
      "What is bitcoin mining \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors \u2014 known as miners \u2014 who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. As a reward for this work, miners earn units of bitcoin for crunching the numbers successfully.",
      "The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor.",
      "But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt.",
      "Trump family's crypto empire grows",
      "The Trump brothers' foray into bitcoin mining marks the family's latest crypto venture. The president and his two eldest sons are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which got a multi-billion dollar boost earlier this month from an Abu Dhabi-based firm, and Mr. Trump launched a highly volatile \"meme coin\" called $TRUMP in January.",
      "Crypto investments make up about $2.9 billion of the family's net worth, one report estimates.",
      "The Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency has drawn criticism for conflicts of interest. Last week, Senate Democrats blocked a crypto regulation bill from moving forward and pushed for it to include new limits on elected officials participating in some types of crypto ventures, with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of \"crypto corruption.\"",
      "The White House has pushed back on the criticism. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said last week Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",

    "story": [
      "A plane carrying dozens of White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport on Monday, a State Department official said, after the Trump administration granted them refugee status in the United States.",
      "The group \u2014 which includes families with children \u2014 was greeted at the D.C.-area airport by U.S. officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar. Landau told reporters the group has faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa \u2014 which the country's government has denied.",
      "Landau said the new arrivals were \"carefully vetted\" in South Africa prior to their arrival. They departed\u00a0Johannesburg via a charter plane on Sunday.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump directed his government to allow South Africans of European descent \u2014 particularly Afrikaners, who are largely descended from Dutch settlers \u2014 to be resettled through the U.S. refugee program.",
      "The administration and its allies, including South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, allege members of South Africa's White minority have faced discrimination by the country's post-apartheid government, including through a controversial law that allows the government to take private land in some circumstances.",
      "\"South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social in February.",
      "The South African government has strongly denied any discrimination, and argues the land seizure law respects private property rights and only targets land that isn't used or doesn't serve the public interest. Land ownership has long been a sensitive issue in South Africa, which was ruled by its White minority under the apartheid system until the mid-1990s.",
      "\"It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the U.S. from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship,\" South Africa's Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation said in a February statement.",
      "Landau also cited attacks on South African farmers in recent years, saying the new arrivals have faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government argues attacks in the country's rural farming communities are not racially targeted and are part of South Africa's broader crime problem.",
      "The Trump administration has also clashed with the South African government over foreign policy, including its criticism of Israel. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in February directing his government to halt aid to South Africa.",
      "The South Africans moved through the refugee process at an unusually fast clip, arriving in the United States after a few months, even though the process frequently takes years.",
      "They also arrived in the United States despite a broader effort by the Trump administration to suspend the refugee admission program \u2014 a move that has drawn court challenges.",
      "Refugee group declines to help resettle South Africans",
      "The federal government typically relies on nonprofits to help resettle refugees in the United States, but at least one group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, said Monday it will not assist with the South African arrivals.",
      "Episcopal Bishop Sean Rowe said the government informed the group \u2014 which receives federal grants \u2014 that it would be expected to assist the South Africans. The group opted against assisting and will instead wind down its work with the government, he said, citing the group's \"steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation.\"",
      "\"It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years,\" Rowe said in a statement.",
      "Some other refugee resettlement groups have indicated they are willing to work with the South Africans.",
      "Church World Service CEO Rick Santos criticized the government for restricting most other refugee admissions, but said the group \"remains committed to serving all eligible refugee populations seeking safety in the United States, including Afrikaners who are eligible for services,\" in a statement to the Associated Press.",

      "ABC News first reported the gift, which comes as Mr. Trump heads to Qatar as part of his first international trip of his second term.",
      "But the plane, a 747-8, won't be ready to serve as Air Force One quite yet, and Mr. Trump won't be using it to fly back to the U.S. from the Middle East. The plane needs to be checked for security and spying devices before it is accepted, one of the sources told CBS News.",
      "The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump defended receiving the plane, saying \"they're giving us a gift.\"",
      "In remarks from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly 40 years old, and he had signed an executive order in his first term to upgrade it.",
      "\"When the election didn't exactly work out the way that it should have, a lot of work was not done on the plane,\" he said. \"When I came back, I said, by the way, what's going on with the Boeings that are coming? 'Well sir, they're way behind.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump continued that \"I think Qatar, who has really, we've helped them a lot over the years in terms of security and safety,\" and that he has \"a lot of respect for the leadership.\"",
      "\"They knew about it because they buy Boeings, they buy a lot of Boeings, and they knew about it, and they said, we would like to do something,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And if we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture. Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday morning that the Qatari government \"graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense\" and the \"legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.\"",
      "Leavitt said she is \"absolutely not\" worried that if Qatar gives the U.S. something, the country expects something in return.",
      "Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar's Media Attach\u00e9 to the U.S., confirmed to CBS News that the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is under consideration between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made.",
      "But Al-Ansar said reports that the plane will be gifted during this trip are \"inaccurate.\"",

      "Qatar has also offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense, but the gift will not be donated or accepted during this trip to Qatar, a U.S. official said.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York confirmed to CBS News that he sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office urging an investigation into the Trump administration accepting a plane as a gift.",
      "\"With an estimated value of $400 million, the aerial palace would constitute the most valuable gift ever conferred on a President by a foreign government,\" he wrote.",
      "Torres asked for an \"immediate ethics review of the Qatari gift\" and \"a formal advisory opinion on whether the gift violates federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause.\"",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Mr. Trump defended the idea of receiving the luxurious jet and lambasted those who criticized what he called a \"free of charge gift\" to \"replace a 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily.\" He claimed it was a \"very public and transparent transaction.\"",
      "\"So bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,\" he wrote. \"Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.\"",
      "The Air Force One was already set to be replaced, with delivery initially set for 2024. But the completion of the modified Boeing 747 was pushed to some time in 2027 for the first plane and in 2028 \u2014 Mr. Trump's final year in office \u2014 for the second, according to the U.S. Air Force.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 09:44:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Court documents reveal an aggressive purge of staff at CFBP, with a 25-year-old DOGE operative appearing to play a key role.",
    "story": [
      "Eva Steege may have seemed like an unlikely combattant in the pushback against mass firings by the Trump administration. The 83-year-old retired Lutheran pastor was in hospice, unable to walk, when she was asked to join a group seeking to block the administration's gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "\"It took us about five minutes to decide that that was a good thing to do,\" her husband Ted Steege, 82, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "When Eva died in March, Ted took her place in the lawsuit which, to this point, has prevented the agency's dismantling and yielded hundreds of pages of internal communications shedding new light on DOGE's effort to slash the federal workforce. Steege has become one face of the human toll wrought by the chaos and scope of the mass federal firings that marked the Trump administration's first 100 days in Washington.",
      "\"We saw an opportunity, not just to gain something that we were entitled to, but also to do something that will change lives for lots of dedicated workers and for people all around the country who have suffered injustices, quiet things that nobody ever notices,\" Ted Steege said.",
      "The injustice the couple faced originated with Eva's decision in her 60s to fulfill a lifelong dream of becoming a pastor. To afford her seminary school tuition, Steege said the couple sold their house and took on $43,000 in debt.",
      "For years, they dutifully paid down the debt but, as of January, still believed they owed about $17,000. On the advice of Lutheran Social Services, the couple approached the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for help enrolling in a federal loan forgiveness program.",
      "Established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the bureau, known as the CFPB, is tasked with protecting consumers from financial fraud and shady lending practices. Workers reviewing the Steeges' case discovered the Steeges didn't need loan forgiveness at all \u2014 that in fact they had overpaid and were owed more than $15,000 in refunds.",
      "Filled with hope, the couple planned on meeting with CFPB staffers on Feb. 10. That morning the Trump administration issued a stop work order effectively shutting down the agency.",
      "\"An email came that said, sorry we have different directives,\" Steege said. \"We can't meet with you.\"",
      "A grieving husband joins the court battle over DOGE firings",
      "Now, he's fighting to restore the bureau's functions by staving off the mass firing of its employees. The battle is playing out in federal court, where earlier this month appellate judges issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's latest effort to slash the workforce.",
      "The ruling came after a flurry of filings in the case made public a trove of emails, internal chats and sworn employee declarations. The documents revealed a frantic push in April by agency leadership and DOGE officials to fire nearly 1,500 employees \u2014 about 90% of the CFPB's staff.",
      "Helping to carry out the mass dismissals was a 25-year-old DOGE official named Gavin Kliger, who has helped implement cuts across at least half a dozen federal agencies. Kliger has no federal government experience prior to working for DOGE.",
      "CBS News reached Kliger by phone, but he declined to offer comments or answer questions. In a statement, a White House spokesperson disputed the idea that Kliger \"managed\" the firings at CFPB, but did not clarify his role. In an internal chat made public in the court filings, messages show Kliger claiming he would \"be running this operation.\"",
      "According to sworn testimony from a CFPB employee, Kliger allegedly demanded staffers prepare firing notices for 36 hours straight, \"screaming at people he did not believe were working fast enough, calling them incompetent.\"",
      "The White House spokesperson said the allegations against Kliger were \"another attempt to diminish DOGE's critical mission to [make] government more effective and efficient.\"",
      "Former director disputes claim of \"vast waste\"",
      "Before they were put on hold by the court, the CFPB's Trump-appointed chief legal officer defended the firings, saying they were necessary to \"better align with Administration police, and right-size Bureau\" and claimed \"leadership discovered vast waste.\"",
      "The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment about the Steeges' case or the ongoing efforts by agency leadership to reduce its workforce.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra called that finding of waste \"completely made up.\" He said the bureau will cease to function if the administration's cuts are allowed to proceed.",
      "\"This is a 'defund the police' approach to looking after Wall Street and the financial industry,\" said Chopra, who was fired by the White House in February despite President Trump having appointed him to a role on the Federal Trade Commission during his first term.",
      "Chopra said extending help to borrowers like Ted and Eva Steege who are looking to mount challenges against predatory lenders is core to the agency's mission.",
      "\"Every day, thousands of people come to the CFPB for help like this, and all of that looks like it's getting shut down,\" he said.",
      "As the courts wrestle over the administration's actions, Ted Steege is continuing to pursue Eva's reimbursement claim, hoping the agency will survive long enough to help deliver the money she was owed.",
      "\"She definitely wanted to have that refund money to be part of our estate and make things better for our children and grandchildren,\" he said.",

It did not say when the release would happen, but two Hamas officials told The Associated Press they expected it to take place within 48 hours.",

He was abducted from a military base where he was stationed near the Gaza border \u2014 one of 251 people taken hostage that day from southern Israel, while 1,200 more were killed.",

We express our deepest gratitude to President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the U.S. administration for their tireless work to make this happen.",
      "\"We urge the Israeli government and the negotiating teams: please don't stop. We hope our son's release begins negotiations for all 58 remaining hostages, ending this nightmare for them and their families. No hostage should be left behind.\"",
      "The hostage families forum had said earlier that it was \"embracing and supporting the Alexander family,\" and that Edan's release \"must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages.\"",

His family lost contact with him after 7 a.m., The Associated Press reported.",
      "\"He told me even though things were already getting dangerous around him. That was the last time I heard my son's voice. I cannot describe the pain of not knowing where your child is or how is he,\" Alexander's mother, Yael Alexander, told CBS New York in October.",
      "She and his father, Adi Alexander, met with former President Joe Biden and President Trump late last year to push for a deal that would free all of the hostages still being held in Gaza. Mr. Trump said earlier this month that fewer than two dozen hostages were believed to be alive. Alexander was thought to be among them.",
      "As attempts to reach a permanent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas have drawn on, militants have periodically freed hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. About 100 hostages were returned to Israel during a brief pause in fighting in November 2023, just over a month after the Oct. 7 attack prompted Israel to declare war on Hamas and begin bombarding Gaza.",
      "Some of the people freed in that first exchange said they had seen Alexander in captivity. His grandmother, Varda Ben Baruch, told the Associated Press at the time that hostages had said her grandson kept his cool and encouraged them that everyone would be released soon.",

      "Militants released 30 of the people between January and March of this year, as part of another exchange agreement with Israel that took place in several stages.

      "It was the first time that Leo had returned to the loggia since he first appeared to the world on Thursday evening following his remarkable election as pope, the first from the United States. Then he delivered a message of peace.",
      "Leo was picking up the papal tradition of offering a Sunday blessing at noon, but with several twists. Whereas his predecessors delivered the greeting from the studio window of the Apostolic Palace, off to the side of the piazza, Leo went to the very center of the square and the heart of the church.",
      "He also offered a novelty by singing the Regina Caeli prayer, a Latin prayer said during the Easter season that past popes would usually just recite.",
      "He wore the simple white cassock of the papacy \u2014 not the formal red cape he wore on Thursday night \u2014 and had reverted back to wearing his silver pectoral cross. He had worn a more ornate one that contains the relics of St. Augustine and his mother, St. Monica, on Thursday night that had been given to him by his Augustinian religious order.",
      "Pope Leo, who was chosen Thursday to become the next pontiff, will be inaugurated at a mass in St. Peter's Square next week. Leo, born in Chicago, is the first U.S.-born pope.",

      "\"I carry in my heart the sufferings of the beloved Ukrainian people,\" he said. \"Let everything possible be done to achieve genuine, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.\"",
      "He called for the release of war prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children to their families, and welcomed the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.",
      "He also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and for humanitarian relief to be provided to the \"exhausted civilian population and all hostages be freed.\"",

      "More than 50 pilgrims from Houston, Texas, were in the square, waving three large American flags. They were in Rome on a pre-planned Holy Year pilgrimage and said they were proud to be part of this historic occasion.",
      "\"Words cannot express my admiration and gratitude to God,\" said the Rev. Dominic Nguyen, who led the Vietnamese American group. He said he hoped the pope would be happy to see the Stars and Stripes but also Peruvian flags and all other countries, showing the universality of the church.",

      "Earlier Sunday, Leo celebrated a private Mass near the tomb of St. Peter with head of his Augustinian order, the Rev. Alejandro Moral Anton. The Mass occurred in the grottoes underneath St. Peter's, the traditional burial place of St. Peter, the apostle who is considered the be the first pope.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 19:44:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trade discussions between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng ended after a weekend of prolonged negotiations.",
    "story": [
      "\"Substantial progress\" was made in sensitive talks between the U.S. and Chinese delegations\u00a0this weekend over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy, the U.S. treasury secretary said on Sunday.",
      "Scott Bessent, along with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland over two days. In his statement Sunday, he offered scant information on exactly what negotiations entailed, but said more details would come at a briefing Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, Greer suggested that an agreement had been reached but provided no details. He and Bessent briefly addressed reporters once talks had wrapped at the stately villa that serves as the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, but did not take questions.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer said.",
      "But he also stressed that a top Trump administration priority means closing the U.S.\u00a0trade deficit\u00a0with China, which came to a record $263 billion last year.",
      "The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.",
      "The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "President Trump\u00a0posted on his social media\u00a0Saturday evening after the first day of meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made.",
      "\"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\"",
      "In an interview with\u00a0NBC News\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but\u00a0pushed the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0to drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first.",
      "Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China\u00a0to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs as\u00a0his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,\u00a0imposed a 10% tax on imports\u00a0from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China's subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Mr. Trump last month\u00a0suspended plans\u00a0to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\"",
      "On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump's trade deal with the U.K. that's still being finalized.",
      "\"I am glad that we have agreed on accelerated trade talks, and we expect that a detailed Swiss proposal will be submitted to Ambassador Greer by next week,\" Bessent wrote on social media. \"Swiss companies have indicated their interest in investing CHF 150-200 billion in new U.S. investments thanks to President Trump's policies, and we look forward to our continued talks.\"",
      "The U.S. is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner after the European Union \u2013 the 27-member country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",

      "British Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Mandelson, speaking on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" warned Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin's calls for a ceasefire proposal \"doesn't seem serious to us.\"",
      "\"At face value, it's constructive that he's offered direct talks,\" Mandelson said. \"But then, when you look at the small print, you see that he wants these talks so as to call into question the very existence of Ukraine as a free, Democratic and sovereign nation.\"",

      "The Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday accused Ukraine of \"violating\" Moscow's three-day ceasefire more than 14,000 times. Ukraine, which did not agree to the May 8-10 ceasefire, has also accused Russia of violating its own truce, with the Ukrainian foreign minister calling it a farce.",
      "The Ukrainian president appeared to insist on his proposal to start a 30-day unconditional ceasefire on Monday. \"There is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day. We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire \u2014 full, lasting, and reliable \u2014 starting tomorrow, May 12th, and Ukraine is ready to meet,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Putin in remarks to the media overnight effectively rejected that ceasefire offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday instead \"without preconditions.\" He said a ceasefire might be agreed on during the negotiations.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday spoke to Macron and Putin and told them in separate phone calls that Turkey was ready to host the peace talks. He also said that a \"historic turning point\" had been reached in efforts to end the conflict, according to a statement from the Turkish presidential communications office.",
      "Putin's counter-offer came after leaders from four major European countries threatened to ratchet up pressure on Moscow if it does not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Saturday and issued a coordinated call for a 30-day ceasefire starting Monday. The plan has received backing from both the European Union and U.S. President Trump.",
      "In a social media post several hours after Putin's overnight remarks about peace talks, Mr. Trump said it was \"a potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!\"",

      "This success has fueled speculation that Gallego is considering running for president in 2028. He's one of a handful of Democrats making stops across the country, talking to voters, similar to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

Jonathan Nichols, from the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, led the team. In a statement shared with NASA, he said their findings blew him away.",
      "\"We wanted to see how quickly the auroras change, expecting them to fade in and out ponderously, perhaps over a quarter of an hour or so,\" said Nichols. \"Instead, we observed the whole auroral region fizzing and popping with light, sometimes varying by the second.\"",
      "Learning more about the variability Nichols' team observed will help scientists better understand how Jupiter's atmosphere works, according to NASA.",
      "Webb's images of Jupiter may have also opened doors to new questions about the universe. When compared to images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which uses different wavelengths of light to capture them, scientists discovered that certain bright spots seen in Webb's images did not appear in Hubble's counterparts.",
      "\"This has left us scratching our heads,\" Nichols told NASA. \"In order to cause the combination of brightness seen by both Webb and Hubble, we need to have a combination of high quantities of very low-energy particles hitting the atmosphere, which was previously thought to be impossible. We still don't understand how this happens.\"",
      "Webb previously captured Neptune's glowing auroras in the best detail yet, many decades after they were first faintly detected during a flyby of the Voyager 2 spacecraft.",

      "Gates first revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" last week, saying he will take an \"equity, value-driven approach\" to the distribution of funds. It will go toward several causes, with a focus on global health and education. His ultimate goal: save tens of millions of lives, especially those of women and children suffering from HIV, malaria and other deadly illnesses.",
      "Here are some highlights from his discussion about his $200 billion mission, as well as what he calls his \"last chapter\" in life \u2014 and more.",
      "\"It's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do\"",
      "Gates said he won't miss the money, but he does hope he'll live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped hard-hit communities.",
      "\"I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers \u2014 as much as I need,\" Gates joked.",
      "Some might be thinking, Why now? To Gates, it's simple: You can get more done by spending more money. That's why the Microsoft co-founder said he's \"doubling down.\"",
      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "\"I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities,\" said Gates, adding that the Gates Foundation can't replace U.S. assistance.",
      "In fiscal 2024, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, with $14.4 billion toward humanitarian assistance, the Pew Research Center reports, citing ForeignAssistance.gov.",
      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "The \"last chapter\" of Gates' career",
      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

      "The billionaire businessman and philanthropist revealed exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",
      "\"The last stage\" of a long career",

      "Dalton, Georgia \u2014 Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, on Monday dismissed the traffic charges that led Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student who has lived in the United States since she was 4.",
      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, who is in the country without authorization, was taken into ICE custody earlier this month after a May 5 traffic stop in Dalton, where she lives with her family. Local police cited her for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton, where she was picked up by ICE officers.",
      "But the Dalton Police Department and the city's prosecutor announced on Monday they had reviewed dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop and determined that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Officials said the vehicle that made the improper turn was similar to the truck Arias Cristobal was driving.",
      "Arias Cristobal is now facing deportation and remains detained at the Stewart ICE detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, according to the agency's online system for tracking detainees. Her father, Jose Francisco Arias Tovar, is also being held there. ICE arrested him last month, also following a traffic stop, his family said.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment on what actions, if any, it would take in response to the decision by authorities in Dalton to drop the traffic violations against Arias Cristobal.",
      "In a statement before Monday's announcement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, called Arias Cristobal an \"illegal alien\" who had \"admitted to illegally entering the United States.\" McLaughlin said Arias Cristobal's father, Arias Tovar, \"self-admitted that he is in the country illegally.\"",
      "Federal officials have not disputed that Arias Cristobal and her father lack criminal records.",
      "\"[The] family will be able to return to Mexico together,\" McLaughlin said in her statement. \"Mr. Tovar had ample opportunity to seek a legal pathway to citizenship. He chose not to. We are not ignoring the rule of law.\"",
      "According to her family, Arias Cristobal came to the U.S. in 2010 and graduated from Dalton's high school last year. She did not qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program for other undocumented immigrant \"Dreamers\" who came to the U.S. as minors because she arrived after the policy's June 2007 cutoff date.",
      "During a press conference on Monday, Chris Crosser, the assistant Dalton police chief, expressed regret about his agency's mistake. But he said he could not opine on how ICE should treat Arias Cristobal's case going forward, given the new information. He said local officials notified her lawyers of the dismissed charges but did not alert ICE.",
      "\"It's a very regrettable place that we are right here, that we've ended up in this place with the way this unfolded and the way it turned out,\" Crosser said, adding that an internal review of the incident is ongoing.",
      "Arias Cristobal's lawyers said their client is likely to remain in ICE custody for now, even after the dismissal of the charges, since federal officials are holding her because she's in the U.S. without legal permission. They said she has a bond hearing scheduled for next week.",
      "Arias Cristobal's arrest is one of several high-profile cases of undocumented immigrants being arrested by ICE during the Trump administration, despite living in the country for many years and lacking criminal histories.",
      "Soon after President Trump took office, his administration dramatically expanded who could face arrest and deportation, reversing Biden-era rules that largely limited ICE operations to arrests of serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals in the U.S. illegally.",
      "While Trump administration officials have said they will prioritize the arrest of dangerous individuals who are in the U.S. unlawfully, they have stressed that no one will be protected from deportation if they lack valid immigration documents.",

This would ensure long-term calm and stability, along with reconstruction and the lifting of the blockade.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called the move \"a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators - Qatar and Egypt - to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones. Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office had said in a statement that \"Israel did not commit to any ceasefire or to the release of terrorists, but only to a safe corridor that would allow for Idan's release.\" Israel's government uses that spelling of Alexander's first name.",

      "Mr. Trump told reporters that \"some prescription drug and pharmaceutical drug prices will be reduced almost immediately by 50% to 80% to 90%,\" and \"big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price of other countries.\"",
      "The president said his move marks an expansion of the \"most favored nation\" idea from his first term, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services set steep price caps tied to the prices charged in other developed countries for how much it would pay for some prescription drugs.",
      "\"It's called most favored nation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world. We will get, whoever is paying the lowest price, that's the price that we're going to get.\"",
      "At the time, that proposal applied only to drugs given by providers in hospitals and clinics through Medicare Part B \u2014 not the broader swath of prescriptions that seniors fill at drug store pharmacies. Medicare said it would only pay hospitals and doctors for a price based on the lowest amount paid among developed countries.",
      "A\u00a0report\u00a0by the Trump administration during its first term found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries on covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "That idea was blocked by the courts during Mr. Trump's first term, after the administration shortcutted \"rulemaking\" steps to try to rush to implement the proposal in its final days. The Biden administration later formally abandoned the proposal and sought instead to curb drug costs through the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program created by Congress.",
      "Under the new version of Mr. Trump's \"most favored nation\" proposal, the White House says it will seek to develop new rules to revive the price caps in Medicare, in addition to a new \"mechanism\" to allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at this price.",
      "Drug manufacturers that \"fail to offer most-favored-nation pricing\" voluntarily will have the prices imposed on them through new rules, which the White House says it is directing the Department of Health and Human Services to propose.",
      "Over the next month, CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said the administration is planning to approach \"pharmaceutical companies to talk specifically about what we want the most favored nation price to be, based on the best data we have.\"",
      "\"We're looking forward to a thoughtful interaction with these corporate leaders, many of whom we've spoken to and in quite will agree, the system is not right the way it is,\" Oz said.",

      "White House officials said ahead of the announcement that they were looking for price reductions in drug costs across both federal and private health insurance, not just Medicare. No specific class of drugs is being targeted, they said, but they are planning to focus on drugs with the biggest disparity between U.S. and foreign prices.",
      "Americans pay significantly more than citizens of other countries do for many of the same pharmaceutical drugs. Experts have blamed it on a range of factors, including a complex web of insurers, middlemen and providers that underpin the U.S. health care system, unlike other countries, which set prices through government-run health care systems.",
      "Industry's response to order",
      "The drug industry has opposed \"most favored nation\" pricing as a \"deeply flawed proposal,\" calling it \"importing socialized medicine\" and claiming it could upend small and mid-size biotech companies in the U.S.",
      "\"Applying other countries' antiquated approach to how they value \u2014 and pay \u2014 for medicines will stall investment across America's biotech companies, risk access to vital treatments and cures for millions of American patients, and lead to fewer American jobs,\" John F. Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, said in a statement Monday.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry argued that Mr. Trump's 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \"upper hand\" in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines.",
      "\"To lower costs for Americans, we need to address the real reasons U.S. prices are higher: foreign countries not paying their fair share and middlemen driving up prices for U.S. patients,\" Stephen J. Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement.",
      "Ubl said \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for patients and workers. However, he praised the White House for ordering the U.S. Trade Representative to address \"freeloading on American-financed innovation.\"",
      "\"The administration is right to use trade negotiations to force foreign governments to pay their fair share for medicines. U.S. patients should not foot the bill for global innovation,\" Ubl said.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 184 points, or 3.3%, to close at 5,844, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 1,161 points, or 2.8%, to close at 42,410. Early morning gains helped the S&P 500 index float back above where it was on April 2, the day President Trump announced sweeping tariffs that threatened to upend the global economy and spark a recession.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite rose 4.4%, providing a measure of relief to tech companies at risk of retaliatory Chinese tariffs and export restrictions. Nvidia and Apple shares gained 5.4% and 6.3%, respectively.",
      "In a joint statement released by The White House on Monday, the U.S. and China on Monday announced that they would substantially lower tariffs for 90 days. The agreement was struck over the weekend in Switzerland, where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Administrator Jamieson Greer\u00a0met with a Chinese trade delegation.",
      "Starting May 14, both countries will lower tariffs by 115%, according to the White House. That will bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% from as high as 145%, and China's rate on American goods down to 10% from 125%. The 10% baseline tariff and other U.S. measures will remain in place.",
      "UBS Global Wealth Management projects the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports will ultimately settle around 30% to 40%.",
      "\"Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement,\" said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.",
      "The value of the dollar climbed against other major currencies, while crude oil prices jumped more than 3% during midday trading. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury also rose to 4.5%, the highest its been since April 11.",
      "Cautiously optimistic",
      "Investors cheered the boom in stocks, but also warned the market rally could falter over the next three months as the U.S. and China approach the end of the tariff pause in August.",

      "Still, the Trump administration's success in striking an agreement with China \u2014 which was viewed as one of the more difficult agreements to negotiate \u2014 paves a smoother road ahead for Wall Street investors.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0reached a deal\u00a0with the U.K. last week, the first trade pact to be announced since so-called \"Liberation Day.\" Mr. Trump introduced the 10% tariff baseline on most imports on April 2, which remains in place.",
      "\"The market is going to take great comfort in the idea that there is a way forward and that all-time highs in the stock market are achievable before yearend,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a research note.",
      "The news also eased fears that the tariffs could tip the U.S. into a serious slump. Oxford Economics dropped their odds of\u00a0 a recession this year to 35%, citing the tariff truce. Still, they maintained a conservative outlook.",
      "\"But as we learned in the first trade war, we don't want to read too much into a single agreement,\" said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, in a research note on Monday.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 17:15:41 -0400",
    "summary": "A House Republican bill would require Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or be enrolled in school for at least 80 hours a month.",
    "story": [
      "A massive change could soon be in the works for the 71 million Americans on Medicaid, with House Republicans unveiling new legislation on Sunday that would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "The proposal is part of an effort by House Republicans to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill, which will extend his 2017 tax cuts while introducing some new reductions, like eliminating taxes on tips.",
      "Because President Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare \u2014 the health insurance program for people 65 and older \u2014 Republican lawmakers have turned their sights to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. GOP lawmakers contend that Medicaid should be scrutinized because it's prone to financial waste, and that, by doing so, the program will be better able to serve the people who need it.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana,\u00a0said\u00a0in February. Rooting out waste \"preserves the programs, so it is available for those who desperately need it.\"",
      "Some policy experts and Democrats in Congress warn that slashing Medicaid would hurt many vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage if the bill passes, while also posing a financial risk to some hospitals that rely on the program.",
      "\"[Nowhere] in the bill are they cutting 'waste, fraud, and abuse' \u2014 they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires,\" said Rep. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12\u00a0statement about the new bill.",
      "The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on.",
      "\"Community engagement requirement\"",
      "Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",
      "If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029.",
      "Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking to tighten these rules for the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\"",
      "Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so.",
      "About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recent\u00a0analysis from heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit.",
      "And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 12 May 2025 17:07:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Since the pandemic, the monthly rent for a typical apartment around the U.S. has surged almost 30% to $1,858, Zillow data shows.",
    "story": [
      "With home prices near a record high and mortgage rates remaining elevated, renting a place to live around the U.S. is today considered a\u00a0better alternative to buying. But here's the catch: Rents are surging, too.",
      "Zillow calculates\u00a0that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental \u2014 up from $60,000 in 2020. And if you want to live in a larger urban area, apartment hunters now need to earn $100,000 or more to live in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, while even modestly sized Riverside, California, requires six figures for people to keep their heads above water, according to the real estate firm.",
      "\"Today renters need to make six figures to afford the typical rental in eight major metropolitan areas \u2014twice as many as before the pandemic,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"That means renters have less money in their budgets for essentials like groceries and transportation, or for saving for a down payment.\"",
      "The typical guidance is to spend no more than 30% of your income on rent. To put that in perspective, that's $2,500 a month for someone making $100,000. To stay below the 30% threshold, renters in the eight cities listed by Zillow need to make at least six figures.",
      "\"This Zillow data backs up what every renter has been feeling when they've been looking for an apartment or trying to renew their lease,\" said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \"Not just in New York City, but across the country, the cost of housing is skyrocketing and they just can't keep up.\"",
      "Here's a look at where around the country you need to earn six figures to afford the rent \u2014 plus cities where you might be able to get away with a lower salary.",
      "Most and least expensive",
      "It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said.",
      "The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillow\u00a0data. The city is doing away with broker fees starting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search.",
      "The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow.",
      "Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston \u2013 or around $55,000.",
      "Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to the\u00a0Census Bureau.",
      "At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even with\u00a0hundreds of thousands of apartments being constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand.",
      "\"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\"",
      "Fee added that to increase the supply of affordable housing and overall inventory, Congress needs to take action by expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which subsidizes affordable housing.",
      "\"Renters across the country are looking to Washington for relief, and Congress has yet to take any meaningful action to increase affordable housing supply,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The first week of the trial is expected to include testimony from an FBI analyst who could break down the now-infamous 2016 video of Combs and his then-girlfriend Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, a male escort and Ventura,\u00a0according to CBS News' Jericka Duncan.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "She and Combs dated off-and-on from about 2007 to 2018.",

      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",

    "summary": "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans.",
    "story": [
      "The United States suspended imports of live cattle through ports along the southern border with Mexico for at least two weeks to review the joint strategy in the fight against the screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Sunday.",
      "Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement that the screwworm, which is a parasite that could be fatal, was recently detected in remote farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles away from the U.S. border.",
      "\"The protection of our animals and safety of our nation's food supply is a national security issue of the utmost importance,\" she said in a statement. \"Once we see increased surveillance and eradication efforts, and the positive results of those actions, we remain committed to opening the border for livestock trade. This is not about politics or punishment of Mexico, rather it is about food and animal safety.\"",
      "Mexico's Agriculture Secretary, Julio Berdegu\u00e9, said on social media that he had spoken with Rollins, who had informed him of the decision.",
      "\"We don't agree with this measure, but we're confident we'll reach an agreement sooner rather than later,\" Berdegu\u00e9 said.",
      "On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has spent the past few months scrambling to offset tariff threats by President Trump, described the Trump administration's decision as \"unfair.\" She said she hoped the suspension would not result in another economic blow for her country.",
      "\"We do not agree with this measure,\" she said at her morning press conference. \"The Mexican government has been working on all fronts from the very first moment we were alerted to the screwworm.\"",
      "What is a screwworm?",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals' skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal.",
      "Mexico's Health Ministry issued an epidemiological alert this month after the first human case of screwworm myiasis was confirmed on April 17 in a 77-year-old woman living in the southern state of Chiapas. Also this year, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department issued a warning in January about animals that may have been impacted by the dangerous \"maneater\" parasites.",
      "The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments in late November following the detection of the pest but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place to evaluate the animals prior to entry into the country.",
      "But there has been an \"unacceptable northward advancement\" of the screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\"Additional action must be taken to slow the northern progression of this deadly parasitic fly,\" the statement added.",
      "Over the last two years, screwworm has spread north throughout Panama and into Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, and now Mexico, the department said.",

Since then, limited details about the flights have been available \u2014 including the costs.",
      "In February, the administration transferred Venezuelan migrants to the facility, before they were taken to Honduras. And the administration has intermittently brought migrants to the base before transferring them elsewhere in the proceeding months.",
      "The data, which came in response to questions from Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the Pentagon outlined that U.S. Transportation Command has flown a total of 46 flights on military aircraft \"in support of migrant deportation flights\" to Guantanamo Bay between Jan. 20 and April 8, with a total of 802 hours and an average cost of $26,277 per flight hour, adding up to more than $21 million.",
      "\"Every American should be outraged by Donald Trump wasting military resources to pay for his political stunts that do not make us safer,\" Warren said in a statement. \"U.S. servicemembers did not sign up for this abuse of power.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and 12 jurors were seated\u00a0along with six alternates on Monday, May 12. The selected group included 12 men and six women.",
      "Opening statements immediately followed, and the prosecutors' case against Combs started to take shape.",
      "\"To the public, he was Puff Daddy or Diddy, a cultural icon, a businessman, larger than life. But there was another side to him,\" one prosecutor said.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial is underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs is being tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs' lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "A jury of 12 jurors and six alternates was sworn in on Monday.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

    "summary": "New Orleans Saints veteran starting quarterback Derek Carr said he decided to retire because of an injury in his right shoulder.",
    "story": [
      "New Orleans Saints veteran starting quarterback Derek Carr is retiring because of a labral tear in his right shoulder and \"significant degenerative changes\" to his rotator cuff, the team announced Saturday.",
      "Carr, 34, has played for 11 pro seasons since being selected out of Fresno State by the then-Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft.",
      "He was acquired by the Saints as a free agent in 2023 but had mixed results in New Orleans, going 14-13 as a starter while struggling through oblique, hand and head injuries that caused him to miss seven games last season.",
      "Carr, who was entering the third year of a four-year, $150 million contract, experienced unexpected pain in his throwing shoulder when he began to ramp up training on his own this offseason. That led to the diagnosis which now has cut short his career.",
      "\"Surgery was an option, jeopardizing the entire 2025 season, yet there was no guarantee Derek would return to the level of strength, function and performance of play to which he was accustomed,\" the Saints said in a written announcement.",
      "The Saints did not acknowledge Carr's injury until the day before this year's NFL draft in late April. Carr did not speak publicly about the injury until a few days later, when he\u00a0delivered a guest sermon at a Las Vegas church. In that sermon, Carr said his critics were \"lying\" about him when they questioned the unusual timing of the injury, as well as both the team's and Carr's initial reticence to address it openly or answer questions about it.",
      "Carr has career passing totals of 41,245 yards, 257 touchdowns and 112 interceptions. The four-time Pro Bowler retires with a 77-92 regular-season record as a starter, 0-1 in the playoffs.",
      "Carr said he made his decision in consultation with his wife, Heather, and \"upon reflection of prayer.\"",
      "\"For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience,\" Carr said. \"It's difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials and especially the fans who made this journey so special.\"",
      "\"I sleep well knowing that I gave my teammates, my coaches, and my cities my all,\" Carr added.",
      "The decision also comes after New Orleans, heading into its first season with Kellen Moore as coach, used a high\u00a0second-round draft choice to select Louisville's Tyler Shough.",
      "Now Shough, who learned of Carr's decision just before taking the field for a rookie camp practice on Saturday, will have a chance to compete for a starting job.",
      "\"All I want is an opportunity,\" said the 26-year-old Shough, who, in part because of injuries, spent seven years at the college level with three programs, starting with Oregon and Texas Tech. \"I've been at points in my career where I would just be dying to get on the field because I was injured. I was a backup before and I was a starter. So, I know a lot of those roles and what it looks like, and I think I can operate well in any of them.\"",
      "\"I'm just really excited for that opportunity to go out there and prove myself,\" he added.",
      "Other QBs on the Saints roster include second-year pro Spencer Rattler and third-year player Jake Haener, who did not post a victory between them in seven games last season, six of which Rattler started.",
      "Carr's retirement \"will provide some of those younger quarterbacks a chance to just get ready from a rep standpoint and opportunity standpoint,\" Moore said. \"Obviously, those guys will be ready and fired up for that.\"",
      "Moore was noncommittal about the possibility of bringing in an established veteran QB through free agency.",
      "\"We'll certainly have awareness of it,\" Moore said. \"We're ready if the opportunity presents itself.\"",
      "Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1966, just 12 quarterbacks who were not drafted in the first round have started season-openers as rookies. One of them was Carr. Another was the Cowboys' Dak Prescott in 2016, when Moore was a reserve QB in Dallas.",
      "Prescott \"was obviously a fourth-round pick and probably wasn't anticipating being a starter that year,\" noted Moore, who also coached Prescott as Dallas' QBs coach in 2018 and as offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2022. \"These guys all come from different paths.\"",

      "Hamas, a U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group, said Sunday evening that it would release Alexander without conditions in the hope of working toward a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and renewing the flow of vital humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian territory. On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, without identifying Alexander, that it had \"successfully facilitated the safe transfer of a hostage from Gaza to Israeli authorities.\"",
      "Alexander, who is now 21, grew up in New Jersey before moving to Israel, where he was serving in the Israeli military on Oct. 7, 2023 when he was abducted during the Hamas-orchestrated attack that sparked the\u00a0war in Gaza.",
      "In February, CBS News spoke to Alexander's mother, Yael, who said she was doing all she could to fight for her son's release and keep going for her other children.",
      "\"It's not easy, but you know what, I'm taking strength from my kids to be ok and to wake up every morning and to put clothes on \u2026 to smile for them, to hug them, to tell them how much I love them and to give them also a lot of hope that Edan is okay.\"",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum welcomed the news of Alexander's release and said they'd be organizing a march at the U.S. embassy in Israel on Monday to demand \"a breakthrough and comprehensive agreement\" to bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "Mr. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed to CBS News that he'd be traveling to the region ahead of Alexander's release, and local media said he had arrived earlier on Monday.",
      "Hamas said Sunday the decision to release Alexander came after \"contacts with the U.S. administration over the past few days,\" and that the group was ready to \"immediately begin intensive negotiations to exert serious efforts to reach a final agreement to end the war, establish a mutually agreed-upon prisoner exchange, and have the Gaza Strip administered by an independent professional body. This would ensure long-term calm and stability, along with reconstruction and the lifting of the blockade.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called the move \"a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators - Qatar and Egypt - to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones. Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office had said in a statement that \"Israel did not commit to any ceasefire or to the release of terrorists, but only to a safe corridor that would allow for Idan's release.\" Israel's government uses that spelling of Alexander's first name.",
      "\"We are in critical days when Hamas is faced with a deal that will allow for the release of our hostages,\" the prime minister's office said. \"Negotiations will continue under fire and while preparations are being made to intensify the fighting.\"",
      "Israel has been preventing the entry of food and medical aid into Gaza for nearly three months, with aid groups saying malnutrition is rising across the enclave. Food security experts said in a report published Monday that the population of Gaza was facing a critical risk of famine.",
      "\"The entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people (one in five) facing starvation\" the group Integrated Food Security Phase Classification said in a report. \"With the announced expansion of military operations throughout the Gaza Strip, the persistent inability of humanitarian agencies to access populations in dire need, an anticipated escalation in hostilities, and the continued mass displacement of people, the risk of Famine in the Gaza Strip is not just possible \u2014 It is increasingly likely.\"",

      "The South African government has strongly denied any discrimination, and argues the land seizure law respects private property rights and only targets land that isn't used or doesn't serve the public interest.

      "Landau also cited attacks on South African farmers in recent years, saying the new arrivals have faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government argues attacks in the country's rural farming communities are not racially targeted and are part of South Africa's broader crime problem.",

In the southern New Corella municipality, supporters of two candidates vying for mayor engaged in a gunfight, leaving two dead and two wounded. In southern Basilan, seven people were killed in suspected election-related shootings. Several others were also injured in shootings in other parts of the country.",

      "\"We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he spent the weekend in meetings with Chinese counterparts.

      "The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump defended receiving the plane, saying \"they're giving us a gift.\"",

      "\"So bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,\" he wrote. \"Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.\"",

      "\"Israel is preparing for the possibility that this move will materialize,\" the statement continued. \"According to Israeli policy, the negotiations will take place under fire with a commitment to achieving all war goals.\"",
      "Witkoff confirmed late Sunday in a message to CBS News that Hamas had agreed to release Alexander.",
      "Alexander is a 20-year-old Israeli-American\u00a0national who grew up in New Jersey and was a soldier in the Israeli military when Hamas launched its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack. He was abducted from a military base where he was stationed near the Gaza border \u2014 one of 251 people taken hostage that day from southern Israel, while 1,200 more were killed.",
      "President Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Sunday that he was \"grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen.\"",
      "\"This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators \u2014 Qatar and Egypt \u2014 to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,\" he wrote. \"Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!\"",
      "In a statement distributed by the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the Alexander family said it had received on Sunday, Mother's Day, \"the greatest gift imaginable \u2014 news that our beautiful son Edan is returning home after 583 days in captivity in Gaza. We express our deepest gratitude to President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the U.S. administration for their tireless work to make this happen.",
      "\"We urge the Israeli government and the negotiating teams: please don't stop. We hope our son's release begins negotiations for all 58 remaining hostages, ending this nightmare for them and their families. No hostage should be left behind.\"",
      "The hostage families forum had said earlier that it was \"embracing and supporting the Alexander family,\" and that Edan's release \"must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages.\"",
      "The group, established by the families of the abductees, urged Mr. Trump and Netanyahu to bring everyone back.",
      "\"You've given the families of all the hostages hope,\" the statement said. \"Please, complete your mission and bring them all home.\"",
      "As fighting escalated at the military base on the morning of Oct. 7, Alexander sent a message to his mother, telling her that he had shrapnel caught in his helmet from surrounding explosions but found a protected area. His family lost contact with him after 7 a.m., The Associated Press reported.",
      "\"He told me even though things were already getting dangerous around him. That was the last time I heard my son's voice. I cannot describe the pain of not knowing where your child is or how is he,\" Alexander's mother, Yael Alexander, told CBS New York in October.",
      "She and his father, Adi Alexander, met with former President Joe Biden and President Trump late last year to push for a deal that would free all of the hostages still being held in Gaza. Mr. Trump said earlier this month that fewer than two dozen hostages were believed to be alive. Alexander was thought to be among them.",
      "As attempts to reach a permanent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas have drawn on, militants have periodically freed hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. About 100 hostages were returned to Israel during a brief pause in fighting in November 2023, just over a month after the Oct. 7 attack prompted Israel to declare war on Hamas and begin bombarding Gaza.",
      "Some of the people freed in that first exchange said they had seen Alexander in captivity. His grandmother, Varda Ben Baruch, told the Associated Press at the time that hostages had said her grandson kept his cool and encouraged them that everyone would be released soon.",
      "Fewer than 50 living people have been released from Hamas captivity since the temporary ceasefire in November 2023.",
      "Militants released 30 of the people between January and March of this year, as part of another exchange agreement with Israel that took place in several stages. Although family members of those in ongoing captivity have repeatedly pleaded with American and Israeli leaders to solidify a deal prioritizing the hostages' safe return, Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas in March and renewed its offensive in Gaza, where Palestinian officials said the death toll has risen to almost 53,000.",

    "story": [
      "The Kurdish group PKK announced on Monday that it will fully disarm and disband, ending its decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state, according to the Firat News Agency, an outlet linked closely with the group. The PKK has long been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Turkey, the European Union, NATO, and many other nations and entities.",
      "The landmark move announced Monday will end a 40-year conflict that killed more than 40,000 people.",
      "The group declared that it had completed its \"historical mission\" and had thus \"decided to dissolve the PKK's organizational structure, with the practical process to be managed and carried out by Leader Apo [Abdullah Ocalan], and to end the armed struggle method.\"",
      "The announcement came after the group's imprisoned founder and ideological leader, Abdullah Ocalan, made a call in a public letter in February, addressed to its leadership, asking the PKK to lay down its arms permanently. The PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire the following month.",
      "The group was formed in 1978 with the ambition of creating a separate, independent homeland for Turkey's large Kurdish minority, but it later dropped its separatist ambitions and focused on achieving greater rights for the group within Turkish society.",
      "A spokesperson for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) welcomed the announcement, calling it, \"a significant step towards a terror free Turkey.\"",
      "Spokesman Omer Celik said the PKK's decision should be \"implemented with all its dimensions, without any shortcomings, and with concrete goals.\"",
      "There were, however, no details immediately released about the technicalities of the group's disbanding, such as what would happen with all the weapons it has held for decades, or if its members would receive legal amnesty in Turkey.",
      "In its statement, the PKK said the issue of Kurdish rights had come \"to a point where it can be resolved through democratic politics,\" urging the Turkish parliament to take \"a historical role\" in completing the process.",
      "Erdogan's government has had a complex relationship with the country's Kurds.",
      "While some progress was made in restoring Kurdish rights since the AKP came to power in 2002, scores of Kurdish rights defenders were also imprisoned after the collapse of peace talks in 2015.",
      "The announcement will have wider consequences for the region, especially in Iraq, Syria and Iran, all of which share borders with Turkey and have significant Kurdish minority populations of their own.",
      "The disarmament of the PKK could also help clear up a thorny issue between the U.S. and its NATO ally. Turkey has long been critical of U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish group YPG, which Turkey considers an extension of the PKK.",

    "summary": "Trade discussions between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng ended after a weekend of prolonged negotiations.",
    "story": [
      "\"Substantial progress\" was made in sensitive talks between the U.S. and Chinese delegations\u00a0this weekend over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy, the U.S. treasury secretary said on Sunday.",
      "Scott Bessent, along with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland over two days. In his statement Sunday, he offered scant information on exactly what negotiations entailed, but said more details would come at a briefing Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, Greer suggested that an agreement had been reached but provided no details. He and Bessent briefly addressed reporters once talks had wrapped at the stately villa that serves as the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, but did not take questions.",
      "\"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer said.",
      "But he also stressed that a top Trump administration priority means closing the U.S.\u00a0trade deficit\u00a0with China, which came to a record $263 billion last year.",
      "The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.",
      "The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "President Trump\u00a0posted on his social media\u00a0Saturday evening after the first day of meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made.",
      "\"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\"",
      "In an interview with\u00a0NBC News\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but\u00a0pushed the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0to drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first.",
      "Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China\u00a0to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs as\u00a0his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,\u00a0imposed a 10% tax on imports\u00a0from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China's subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Mr. Trump last month\u00a0suspended plans\u00a0to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\"",
      "On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump's trade deal with the U.K. that's still being finalized.",
      "\"I am glad that we have agreed on accelerated trade talks, and we expect that a detailed Swiss proposal will be submitted to Ambassador Greer by next week,\" Bessent wrote on social media. \"Swiss companies have indicated their interest in investing CHF 150-200 billion in new U.S. investments thanks to President Trump's policies, and we look forward to our continued talks.\"",
      "The U.S. is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner after the European Union \u2013 the 27-member country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",

      "Middle East Forum executive director Gregg Roman tells Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE will focus on defense and economic cooperation with \"the Abraham Accords 2.0\" on its way to the negotiating table.",
      "Former President Donald Trump is embarking this week on a high-stakes tour of the Persian Gulf region, targeting business deals and strategic partnerships with three oil-rich nations: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.",
      "The trip marks Trump's first major foreign visit of his new term and comes as nuclear negotiations with Iran drag on and as war continues between Israel and the Palestinian terror organization, Hamas, in the Gaza Strip. While business is the official focus, the backdrop is anything but calm.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the mission as part of Trump\u2019s broader vision that \"extremism is defeated [through] commerce and cultural exchanges.\"",
      "Under President Joe Biden, U.S. relations with Gulf states cooled, particularly after Biden vowed to make Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a \"pariah\" over the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But Trump has reversed course, embracing a more transactional approach that has warmed ties with regional leaders.",

      "In addition to economic deals, Trump and bin Salman are expected to discuss a possible civil nuclear program and expanded defense cooperation. Such agreements were once linked to a potential Abraham Accords-style normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "But Riyadh has made clear it won\u2019t recognize Israel unless Palestinian statehood is on the table, something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has staunchly opposed. No stop in Israel is scheduled during Trump\u2019s tour.",
      "\"Israeli normalization in any Saudi-U.S. project is an outdated option,\" said Saudi geopolitical analyst Salman Al-Ansari. \"The second Trump administration is doubling down on its strategically autonomous Middle East policy.\"",

      "This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).",

Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents.

      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",

      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks.

As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows.

That means your balance might look normal, while your actual funds are long gone. This type of attack is extremely rare and usually requires access to a compromised or jailbroken device, but it\u2019s technically possible and just sophisticated enough to delay you from realizing what happened.",

      "The good news? You don\u2019t need to be a cybersecurity expert to protect yourself. Just following these key steps can dramatically reduce your risk.",
      "1) Use official apps only: Cybercriminals will try to trick you with fake banking apps and mobile trojans that overlay fake login screens, so it\u2019s critical to download banking apps exclusively from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Never install apps from links in emails or texts.",
      "2) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): SIM-swapping attacks can hijack your phone number and intercept SMS codes, so enable app-based\u00a02FA to block unauthorized logins even if hackers obtain your password.",
      "3) Get text or app alerts: Hackers can manipulate your account\u2019s display to hide stolen funds, so set up real-time transaction alerts to expose unauthorized withdrawals immediately, especially for microtransactions used to test your account.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords: Phishing scams and keyloggers often harvest weak or reused credentials, so use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Avoid clicking suspicious links and install strong antivirus software: Scammers impersonate banks with phishing emails/texts containing misspelled URLs (e.g., \"captial0ne.com\"), so always navigate directly to your bank\u2019s official website or app instead of clicking embedded links. Strong antivirus software helps protect your devices from fake apps, keyloggers and other threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Check your accounts regularly: Don\u2019t just glance at your balance. Review recent transactions at least once a week to catch any suspicious activity.",
      "7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking: Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "8) Use a personal data removal service: Data brokers sell your contact details and personal information, which hackers can use for targeted phishing attacks or SIM swap scams. These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT\u00b2 Aerospace\u2019s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways.",
      "The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance.",
      "However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT\u00b2 Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT\u00b2 Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships.",

      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

      "A person texting on their phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Knowing the basics: SMS vs. MMS vs. RCS",
      "Before you can figure out which phone carrier fits your messaging needs, it helps to understand the differences between the three main types of mobile messaging \u2014 SMS, MMS and RCS. Each has its own capabilities, limitations and impact on your experience.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "SMS (Short Message Service) is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days of mobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don\u2019t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal.",
      "MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)\u00a0builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur.",
      "RCS (Rich Communication Services) represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, and the service works over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels.",
      "While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality.",
      "HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE",
      "Why it matters when choosing a wireless carrier",
      "Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it\u2019s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work.",
      "Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported.",
      "For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges.",
      "While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliably\u00a0Google Messages.",
      "If you\u2019re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it\u2019s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient\u2019s carrier or device does not support RCS.",

      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

      "So far, the microrobot has been tested in preclinical trials, mainly on sheep, with very promising results. There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

      "Why this technology matters",
      "The potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot represents an exciting fusion of robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, and medicine. It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain. While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory approvals and manufacturing at scale, this tiny device has the potential to turn previously \"inoperable\" brain tumors into treatable conditions. As one of the company\u2019s founders describes it, the microrobot acts like a \"brain gardener,\" delicately tending to damaged tissue from within. With strong funding and a growing portfolio of patents, Robeaut\u00e9 is poised to make a lasting impact on the future of neurosurgery.",

      "When sending photos from an iPhone to an Android phone, images often appear blurry or compressed due to differences in messaging protocols and compression methods. This issue arises because Apple uses SMS/MMS to send messages to Android devices, which compresses images due to size limitations. Additionally, iPhones often use the HEIC format, which may not be fully supported on Android devices, leading to compatibility issues and reduced quality.",

      "Several third-party messaging apps, such as FaceBook Messenger and Telegram, allow you to keep your photo files at their original size, ensuring that quality doesn't decrease.

Thankfully, with the introduction of RCS messaging on iPhones, you can now send uncompressed images, significantly improving quality. Additionally, utilizing cloud services like Google Photos or third-party messaging apps can help maintain image clarity.

      "Cybercriminals aren't just going after big targets anymore.",
      "They're going after everyone, and they're doing it with infostealer malware. These small, sneaky programs are quietly stealing passwords, browser data and login tokens from everyday devices.",

      "The industrialization of credential theft",
      "In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed a staggering surge in stolen login data being traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users\u2019 devices.",
      "At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extract sensitive information like usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don\u2019t break into a company\u2019s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing.",
      "These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing.",
      "Fortinet\u2019s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report identified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon.",

      "How infostealers work",
      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

They\u2019re evidence of an evolving, industrialized cybercrime economy built on the backs of unsuspecting users and quietly infected devices. The tools are cheap, the scale is massive and the impact is personal.

      "27-inch light-field display (Looking Glass)",
      "How it works",
      "The\u00a0Looking Glass 27 uses light-field display technology, which projects multiple perspectives of an object simultaneously. This allows for \"Super Multi View\" experiences, where everyone around the screen can see a slightly different angle, just like in the real world. It\u2019s a step beyond traditional 3D displays, offering richer depth cues and a more natural viewing experience.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The display can showcase single images, 3D videos or interactive applications, and it\u2019s flexible enough to handle everything from quick model previews to fully interactive group experiences.",

      "Shawn Frayne, Looking Glass\u2019 CEO and co-founder, describes this release as a \"breakthrough moment for 3D.\" The new 27-inch display is the company\u2019s most advanced yet, combining major hardware and software advances to cut costs and dramatically reduce the computing power needed to run complex 3D content.",
      "The display sits at just an inch thick but packs a punch with 5K resolution (5,120 x 2,880 pixels) at 60 Hz, delivering up to 16 inches of virtual depth and 8-bit color. The result? Real-time 3D visuals that look and feel like they\u2019re actually present in the room.",
      "But what really sets this display apart is its ability to create a shared 3D experience. Unlike traditional VR or AR setups that require each participant to wear a headset, the Looking Glass 27 can project up to 100 unique perspectives across a 53-degree viewing cone. This means a team can gather around a single screen and see the same digital object from different angles, just as they would with a real-world prototype or artifact.",

      "Looking Glass has made it easier than ever for developers and enterprises to build, test and deploy 3D applications. Content creation starts on a computer running Unity, but the finished product can be deployed on an iPad, which also powers the display and serves as its interface. This approach reduces system costs by about 35% compared to previous models and makes deployment far more flexible. The display also supports Blender, Unreal Engine, WebXR and Looking Glass\u2019 own Studio and Bridge tools, making it compatible with a wide range of 3D workflows.",
      "The display is designed for versatility. It can sit on a desk or be mounted on a wall, and it\u2019s available in both portrait and landscape configurations (though you\u2019ll need to pick one when ordering). The software ecosystem allows for quick creation of 3D apps using Unity templates, and content can be managed just like any other iOS application, streamlining updates and deployment.",

Imagine medical students exploring a virtual anatomy lesson together or design teams collaborating on a 3D prototype without the hassle of headsets. The display\u2019s ability to render depth, texture, translucency and lighting effects as they appear in real life makes it a powerful tool for any field that benefits from visualizing complex, spatial information.",

TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport.",
      "However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025. The Global Entry card is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler card that meets federal identification standards and is explicitly accepted by TSA as an alternative to a REAL ID.

Other DHS Trusted Traveler cards, like NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST, are also accepted as alternatives.",

      "Aurora, a leader in autonomous vehicles, has officially deployed its driverless trucks on Texas roads, marking a key milestone in the evolution of transportation.",
      "This development raises important questions about safety, reliability and the future of the trucking industry.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What's happening?",
      "Aurora's autonomous trucks now operate on routes between Dallas and Houston, hauling commercial loads.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "This isn't just a test program; it's a full deployment of driverless technology. Additional trucks will start operating on public roads in New Mexico and Arizona by the end of 2025, traveling at speeds ranging from 25 to 75 mph.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL",
      "How safe are these trucks?",
      "The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.\u00a0Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Report outlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds.",
      "Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over 2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents.",
      "Safety case and validation",
      "Aurora's safety approach is evaluated through a \"safety case\" method, commonly used in aviation and nuclear industries. A third-party audit by T\u00dcV S\u00dcD validated Aurora's safety management system, confirming alignment with SAE International's level 4 and level 5 standards. This audit also praised Aurora's safety culture and oversight practices.",

      "Industry pushback: OOIDA and Teamsters raise concerns",
      "The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), representing over 150,000 truckers, strongly questions Aurora's safety claims.",
      "\"Simulations and supervised testing aren't enough,\" OOIDA states.\u00a0\"Phantom braking and unpredictable road conditions make autonomous trucks a risky proposition. Until there's mandatory, transparent oversight, these safety claims are premature.\"",
      "OOIDA also criticizes the lack of robust federal regulation, pointing to voluntary data programs like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) AV TEST as inadequate.",
      "\"Exemptions from FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) safety rules weaken proven standards,\" OOIDA argues. The association wants mandatory crash and disengagement reporting and warns against removing trained drivers from the cab entirely.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a labor union representing more than 1.2 million workers in North America, shares similar safety concerns.",
      "\"The Aurora Driver can't operate in severe weather like ice, unplowed snow or torrential rain,\" said Matt McQuaid, communications project manager for the Teamsters. He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\u00a0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.",
      "This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What this means for the future",
      "There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",
      "\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.",
      "That said, a\u00a0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\u00a0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.",
      "Still, consistent federal regulation is lacking. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has called for nationwide standards: \"We can't fall behind China or other countries. After safety, we need to give a wide runway for innovation.\"",

However, it's crucial to keep a close eye on how this technology develops. We need independent verification of safety claims and a proactive approach to managing the impact on jobs.

      "No person should face criminal punishment for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go.Encampment policies must prioritize shelter and services and ensure that people experiencing homelessness and their belongings are treated with respect.Policies must not unduly limit local authorities to clear encampments, meaning officials must be able to enforce \"commonsense policies\" to protect the health and safety of their residents and maintain their public spaces.",

    "summary": "House Republicans unveiled the legislative text of their sweeping tax proposal for the massive bill for President Donald Trump's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Monday unveiled the legislative text of their sweeping tax proposal for the massive bill for President Donald Trump's agenda, but a key divide within the conference remains: how much to lift the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., convened a video call Monday morning with members of both the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and the SALT Caucus, a group of blue-state Republicans who have been fighting to raise the SALT cap much higher than the current level of $10,000. While several proposals were discussed, GOP lawmakers were unable to agree on a number.",
      "During an all-member GOP conference call in the afternoon, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, told colleagues that the final SALT number was still a work in progress, according to two lawmakers on the call.",
      "The legislative text currently calls for the SALT deduction cap to be hiked to $30,000, and includes limits for those who make more than $400,000 a year. But SALT Caucus members \u2014\u00a0 including Reps. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Young Kim, R-Calif. \u2014 have said that number is a nonstarter.",
      "One House Republican close to the process told NBC News there would be enough GOP votes to sink the bill if that SALT figure remains in the final product. Republicans can afford just three defections for the final package once it reaches the House floor.",
      "Lawler said there was \"zero chance\" he would support the current version of the bill.",
      "\"As I have said repeatedly, I will not support any bill that does not adequately lift the cap on SALT. This bill as written fails to deliver and will not have my support,\" Lawler said. \"I look forward to continuing to negotiate with leadership and the administration to provide real tax relief for my constituents.\"",
      "LaLota wrote on X after the text was posted: \u201cStill a hell no.\u201d",
      "\"We are not budging and this bill, as written, will not receive any of our votes,\" said a pro-SALT Republican lawmaker who is opposed to the current proposal.",
      "But Smith is pressing forward with a markup in his committee beginning Tuesday afternoon, leaving Johnson with the difficult task of striking a deal on SALT before a final floor vote, which he is aiming to hold next week.",
      "The prickly tax issue has created some tension between Johnson and Smith. During the morning video meeting, Smith told his colleagues it wasn\u2019t his job to negotiate with the SALT Caucus Republicans, but the speaker\u2019s job, according to two sources on the call.",
      "Smith explained that his bill reflects the will of his committee, not of the SALT Caucus, the sources said. The speaker, the sources said, didn\u2019t directly commit to arbitrate the issue.",
      "Johnson's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the video call with Johnson, pro-SALT Republicans said they supported a figure floated last week by Kim: a $62,000 cap for individual tax filers and a $124,000 cap for joint filers, one source on the call said.\u00a0But it\u2019s unclear whether all pro-SALT Republicans, who have had mixed ideas on how to solve the issue, are equally committed to that figure. Another GOP source with first-hand knowledge of the situation noted that the pro-SALT group has been non-committal on a number throughout much of this process.",
      "But Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only SALT member who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, announced her support for the SALT figure and overall tax proposal.",
      "\"Tripling the deduction to $30,000 will provide much-needed relief for the middle-class and cover 98% of families in my district,\" said Malliotakis, whose district includes Staten Island.",
      "Malliotakis' signal of support indicates that Smith may have the votes to get the bill out of the Ways and Means Committee and pass the issue onto Johnson, forcing him to amend the legislation to find the votes in the full House.",
      "The broader plan released by the Ways and Means Committee Monday would extend the expiring tax cuts Trump signed into law into 2017 and incorporates some of Trump\u2019s other campaign promises, including eliminating federal taxes on tips and overtime through 2028. It also creates a tax break for auto loan interest payments, which Trump had campaigned on in the swing state of Michigan in 2024.",
      "And the plan establishes so-called \"MAGA accounts,\" new savings accounts for newborns.",
      "The plan, though, does not include a tax hike on the wealthy, despite Trump personally urging the speaker to add it during a phone call last week. Trump had pushed to raise the tax rate for higher-income earners to 39.6%, up from the current 37% rate. But Trump\u2019s proposal quickly ran into a buzzsaw of opposition from anti-tax Republicans.",
      "Democrats from high-tax states, like New York, slammed the $30,000 SALT cap as paltry.",
      "\"This number is nothing short of insulting to hardworking Long Islanders,\" said first-term Rep. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y. \"For years, Republicans in New York and other high-tax states promised to oppose any bill that failed to restore the full deduction. It's time for them to honor that promise.\"",

      "The fire in west Baltimore was reported shortly before 7 p.m., and it quickly escalated in scale from 4-alarm, to 5-alarm, the Baltimore Fire Department said in a series of statements on social media. Fire Chief James W. Wallace later said the blaze had grown to 6-alarm status.",
      "More than 200 firefighters were assigned to the blaze, Wallace said.",
      "The department characterized the location as a vacant mattress warehouse with multiple stories. \"At this time, the fire remains active and not under control,\" it said.",
      "No injuries have been reported.",
      "The number of alarms correlates to a larger number of firefighters sent to a blaze. In all of 2021, the city said in a report on fire resources, the department responded to one each for third, fourth and fifth-alarm fires. No sixth-alarm or greater fires were reported.",
      "Wallace said the fire department was told the building has two underground floors stacked with mattresses, which may be providing fuel. Three other floors are above ground, he said.",
      "\"What we\u2019re dealing with now is a deep-seated subsurface fire,\" the chief said during an impromptu news conference near the blaze. \"What we\u2019re trying to do is cut it off.\"",

      "Video of the blaze aired on the station showed a red brick building with windows offering interior views of a glowing cauldron of orange-tinged flames.",
      "Firefighters took defensive positions on the rooftops of nearby row houses, the station's coverage showed.",
      "\"It's such a smoky fire,\" Wallace said earlier in the evening, during WBAL's coverage. \"We're trying to approach this the right way, obviously safely.\"",
      "The warehouse is adjacent to a major passenger rail corridor between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and Amtrak said trains along the line will be paused until conditions improve.",
      "\"Crews are working diligently to ensure safety and restore service as soon as possible,\" the rail service said in a statement.",
      "Wallace expressed fear that some of the structure near train tracks could collapse as the flames continued to cook the old brick-and-mortar structure.",
      "The fire was in the 130-year-old Midtown-Edmondson neighborhood on the west side of the city. The fire department requested that people avoid the area near Edmondson Avenue and Bantalou Street.",
      "Citing Wallace, WBAL reported that some people in the area were being moved out, and that aid from the Red Cross \u2014 which often helps residents displaced by fire find temporary shelter \u2014 has been requested.",

He said he was asked about his views, including whether he supports President Donald Trump, and whether he has been in contact with Hamas, the Houthis or Hezbollah.",

      "His video comes amid a recent influx on social media of similar posts by people recounting their interactions with immigration officials after their return to the U.S. Some said that they were grilled about their social media usage.

As a taxpayer, I believe CBP agents should be focusing on actual threats, like preventing agricultural risks or combatting trafficking, not interrogating people about their political beliefs.\u201d",
      "In his stream, he noted that it's his birthright as a U.S. citizen to re-enter the country. \u00a0He said he pushed back when asked about his political beliefs.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re giving us a free jet,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI could say, \u2018No, no, no, don\u2019t give us. I want to pay you a billion or $400 million, or whatever it is,\u2019 or I could say, \u2018Thank you very much.\u2019 You know?\u201d",
      "A Qatar press official, Ali Al-Ansari, said in a statement Sunday said the deal still under review.",
      "\"The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,\" he said.",
      "Trump reiterated his frustration over the time it\u2019s taken for Boeing to complete jets that will replace the 747s that he is using now. The new planes may not be ready until 2027, the midpoint of Trump\u2019s term.",
      "Converting the Qatari gift into Air Force One would require an overhaul that would take years to carry out and raise possible security concerns, according to three aviation and intelligence experts.\u00a0It would likely would have to be effectively dismantled, part by part,\u00a0to ensure there were no listening devices or other security vulnerabilities that could allow foreign powers to eavesdrop.",
      "The commercial jet would then have to be refitted with costly, sophisticated systems for mid-air refueling, missile defense, secure government communications and back-up power. The plane also would need to be hardened against potential electromagnetic pulse weapons.",
      "Air Force One is more than a means of presidential travel. With its distinctive blue and white, it is an emblem of American power and prestige. It functions as a kind of flying bunker for the commander in chief, capable of withstanding a nuclear blast. If the transfer happens, Air Force One would acquire what some describe as a foreign taint for this quintessential symbol of American pride.",
      "The Qatari plane and its whiff of excess would also seem at odds with Trump's message that Americans may have to make do with less as he remakes the global economic order. Fewer dolls and pencils for America's children, while the president flies in style.",
      "Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary in Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s White House, posted on social media that \u201cNothing about getting Air Force One from a foreign government feels right.\u201d",
      "\u201cAir Force One should be American through and through,\u201d Fleischer added. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t pass through foreign hands and it shouldn\u2019t be a gift from a king. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Trump first toured the Qatari plane in February at the airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago home. Known as the \u201cflying palace,\u201d the aircraft clearly made a favorable impression.",
      "\u201cYou look at some of the Arab countries and the planes they have parked alongside of the United States of America plane. It\u2019s like from a different planet,\u201d Trump told reporters Monday.",
      "During his first term, Trump complained that Air Force One wasn\u2019t as luxurious inside as his private plane, a former White House official said. Asked for comment, the White House did not immediately respond.",
      "Congress\u2019 GOP leaders gave muted responses when questioned about the swap Trump envisions. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana declined comment. Senate Republican leader John Thune of South Dakota said, \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about it yet, and I don\u2019t know there\u2019s even been any offer.\u201d",
      "Getting Congress to approve the present, in keeping with the constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, would seem a heavy lift. A 60-vote supermajority would be required for Senate passage.",
      "But if Trump forges ahead and accepts the plane without Congress\u2019 assent, there may not be much to stop him. He demonstrated in his first term that he has little to fear by way of impeachment.",
      "\u201cIs Congress going to impeach him? Probably not,\u201d said Richard Painter, who was chief ethics lawyer in George W. Bush\u2019s White House.",
      "What\u2019s more, the Supreme Court gave presidents broad immunity from prosecution in a landmark ruling last year.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has insisted any accepted gifts will be in accordance with the law.",
      "\u201cAny gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s administration is committed to full transparency.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the only scenario Trump may need to worry about is that, after he leaves office, a future president may try to reclaim the aircraft for the U.S., seizing it from the Trump library.",
      "\u201cYou might have a future administration file suit and seek to repossess the plane as property of the U.S. government, because it should never have been accepted to begin with,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Newt Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker and Trump ally, said that \u201cin an ideal world,\u201d Trump would get Congress to approve the gift.",
      "\u201cThe lawyers have to go through some hoops here, but if there is no quid pro quo and it\u2019s all out in the open in public, it doesn\u2019t strike me as an automatic problem,\u201d Gingrich told NBC News.",
      "Ethics advisers in past administrations said they were wary of expensive gifts from foreign sources, no matter the reason. When President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in his first term, he refused the more than $1 million that comes with it. Instead, the Nobel committee distributed the prize money among various charities, said Norm Eisen, who was a special counsel for ethics and government reform in the Obama administration.",
      "Painter recalled that during the Bush administration, Saudi Arabia\u2019s government offered a Rolex watch to a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cWe saw to it that the gift was either returned or turned over to the U.S. government,\u201d Painter said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to have one of our top White House national security officials running around with a Rolex watch from the Saudis.\""

      "Popular kids\u2019 content creator Rachel Griffin Accurso, known as Ms. Rachel, addressed the ongoing backlash over her advocacy for Palestinian children, saying in a recent interview that \u201cit should be controversial to not say anything.\u201d",
      "Known for her YouTube series \u201cSongs for Littles,\u201d Accurso\u2019s channel \u2014 which has 14.7 million subscribers \u2014 focuses on teaching young kids nursery rhymes, first words and basic educational concepts like colors and shapes. But elsewhere on her social media platforms, the educator has been outspoken about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has taken shape since Israel began its military response to Hamas\u2019 deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad that people try to make it controversial when you speak out for children that are facing immeasurable suffering,\u201d Accurso said in an interview with journalist Mehdi Hasan, founder of the independent publication Zeteo.",
      "Accurso did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on Monday.",
      "The interview comes on the heels of intensified scrutiny of Accurso, who has been accused of antisemitism by some online critics who take issue with her posts about Palestinian children.",
      "Last month, the pro-Israel group StopAntisemitism requested that Attorney General Pam Bondi investigate whether Accurso is \u201cbeing funded by a foreign party to push anti-Israel propaganda to skew public opinion.\u201d They accuse her of being \u201can amplifier of Hamas propaganda,\u201d claiming some statistics and images she has shared about children in Gaza are false.",
      "Accurso did not address the probe request in her interview with Hasan. But she rejected claims that she is antisemitic because she advocates for the lives of children in Gaza. As an educator, she said, her empathy extends to all children around the world.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to get this platform. And kids feel that I care about them all deeply, and that\u2019s why I have the platform. Because they feel it through the screen, because it\u2019s genuine,\u201d Accurso said. \u201cAnd kids know when things aren\u2019t genuine. And that care doesn\u2019t end with the kids that are watching, or any kids.\u201d",
      "Accurso, a mother to two young children, said her background in early childhood education made her aware that many of the youngest children in Gaza are being malnourished and traumatized in ways that harm their brain development during the crucial first three years of life. But mainly, she said, her concern is simply fueled by empathy.",
      "Since she began working with the humanitarian nonprofit Save the Children, Accurso said she learned more about situations faced by children around the world, from the U.S. to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Gaza.",
      "She said she was \u201chorrified\u201d by Oct. 7, as well as the \u201cdistressing, horrific images\u201d of suffering in Gaza. She has since used her platforms to raise awareness and call out human rights violations against children.",
      "Last year, Accurso posted a tearful Instagram reel in which she shared that she was being bullied online after she held a fundraiser for Save the Children\u2019s emergency fund for kids in conflict zones like Gaza, Sudan, the Congo and Ukraine. She wrote in her caption that she cares for \u201cPalestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US \u2014 Muslim, Jewish, Christian children \u2014 all children, in every country. Not one is excluded.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea that caring for a group of children in an emergency situation means you don\u2019t care about other children is false,\u201d Accurso reiterated in Monday\u2019s interview.\u00a0\u201cAnd I just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d",
      "Accurso has continued her advocacy this year, highlighting the stories of Palestinian children like Hind Rajab. In recent months, she spotlighted a family whose home was destroyed and a 3-year-old who lost both her legs in an airstrike, among others.",
      "\u201cOur compassion doesn\u2019t have boundaries or borders,\u201d she told Zeteo. \u201cWe just love kids.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Democratic National Committee subcommittee on Monday recommended that the organization invalidate one of its February vice-chair votes over claims that it unfairly disadvantaged female candidates.",
      "The move, which won't be official unless the entire DNC votes to approve it, could open up new races for the positions held by David Hogg, a Florida activist, and Malcolm Kenyatta, a Pennsylvania state legislator.",
      "The challenge by Oklahoma Democratic Committeewoman Kalyn Free, who unsuccessfully ran against Hogg and Kenyatta in the February race for vice chair, is not related to the ongoing tension between Hogg and the national party over his push to support primary challenges against incumbent Democrats.",
      "Instead, it was based off Free's claim that the handling of the vice-chair vote gave the two men an unfair advantage amid the national party's requirements that its executive committee achieve gender balance.",
      "Nevertheless, the Monday evening vote by the DNC Credentials Committee sets up a high-profile decision for the national party in the coming weeks as it will now be up to the full body to vote on whether to call for a new election for the vice-chair positions held by Hogg and Kenyatta.",
      "This is all happening\u00a0as DNC Chairman Ken Martin has been separately pushing a reform that would \u201crequire all party officers \u2014 including myself \u2014 to remain neutral in primaries\" as Hogg has been signaling he's planning to take sides.",
      "DNC rules require that the national party's executive committee \"shall be as equally divided as practicable\" along gender lines. (If the committee includes members who identify as non-binary, they don't count for the purposes of gender division.) As DNC members met earlier this year for the multi-hour process of voting in a new slate of officers, the vote for the three vice chairs being the last position to be filled, it became clear that the party needed to elect at least one man to the final two vice chair spots to maintain the required gender equity on the seven-person executive committee.",
      "The party then decided to hold a single vote to decide the final two slots instead of holding separate votes for each position.",
      "Free claimed that the combined ballot unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta, the only two men left in the race, because members had to vote for at least one man on the combined ballot. She argued it's possible they could have voted differently if the ballots were separated.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Representatives for Hogg and Kenyatta disagreed with the challenge, arguing that the party was well within its discretionary right to make a move to shorten the lengthy voting process in real time.",
      "The challenge to the DNC election dates from late February, well before the disagreement between Hogg and the party went public. But now, the 400-plus member DNC will have to vote on whether to call for a new election that could cost Hogg his position against this backdrop.",
      "In a statement Monday night, Hogg noted that the issue was over how the national party handled the election, not any accusation he nor Kenyatta did anything wrong. And he added that \"it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote.\"",
      "\"I ran to be DNC Vice Chair to help make the Democratic Party better, not to defend an indefensible status quo that has caused voters in almost every demographic group to move away from us,\" he said, adding that he views the vote as a way for the party to \"fast-track\" an attempt to remove him from his position.",
      "Kenyatta posted on social media that he while he respected the vote, he disagreed with the committee\u2019s decision, calling it a \u201cslap in my face.\u201d",
      "He also weighed in on the characterization by some who see the vote as the latest in the saga between Hogg and the party.",
      "\u201cI worked my a-- off to get this role and have done the job every day since\u00a0I\u2019ve\u00a0held it,\u201d he said in a long thread on X. \u201cThis story is complex and\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0frustrated\u2014but it\u2019s not about [David Hogg].\u00a0Even though he clearly wants it to be.\u201d",
      "Martin, in a statement of his own issued after the vote, framed the debate as strictly about a failure of parliamentary procedure and one he's looking to party members to decide.",
      "\"During my campaign for Chair, I pledged to run the DNC with integrity, openness, and fairness. I am disappointed to learn that before I became Chair, there was a procedural error in the February Vice Chair elections,\" he said.",
      "\"The Credentials Committee has issued their recommendation, and I trust that the DNC Members will carefully review the Committee\u2019s resolution and resolve this matter fairly,\" he added.",
      "The decision came after a three-hour virtual meeting, livestreamed on the party's YouTube page, that stretched even longer because the 18-member committee tied on its first ballot, which triggered another round of debate. The committee membership has been held over from the appointments by the previous national party chairman, Jaime Harrison, not new appointees by the new chairman.",
      "Eventually, the side that supported the recommendation for a new election won over key opponents, and approved a resolution with the support of 13 members declaring the election to the vice chair seats held by Hogg and Kenyatta \"incomplete.\" It recommends the DNC hold new elections for both seats \"as soon as practicable,\" with only the candidates eligible at the party's final ballot. Hogg and Kenyatta would be allowed to run again, but it's not a given they'd win the seats.",
      "Mark Mallory, a credentials committee member and former mayor of Cincinnati, said during the meeting that he supported the decision because while \"our former chairman did not do anything to intentionally disenfranchise any of the candidates running for vice-chair. However, the result has been just that.\"",
      "Mallory compared the process to when a patient with a broken leg has to go get the bone reset at the hospital.",
      "\"That process is painful too, but it is a part of the recovery of the initial incident,\" he said. \"We have, I believe, a responsibility to act.\""

About half of Burkina Faso is outside of government control as a result of the violence that contributed to two coups in 2022. Government security forces have also been accused of extrajudicial killings.",

      "\u201cJNIM fighters attacked eight localities simultaneously to disperse the Burkina Faso air force. The main attack occurred in Djibo, where JNIM fighters first took control of all the town\u2019s entry checkpoints before attacking the military camps, particularly the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit\u2019s camp,\u201d said the aid worker.",
      "Werb, who studied videos posted online, said the attackers spent several hours in the areas without air support from Burkina Faso\u2019s military, unlike similar attacks on Djibo in the past, when security forces have successfully repelled the extremists.",
      "The latest attack shows JNIM\u2019s escalating power and widening reach in Burkina Faso, said Wassim Nasr, a Sahel specialist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center security think tank. \u201cThe fact that Djibo was targeted confirms the extent of JNIM\u2019s freedom of movement within Burkina Faso.\u201d",

But the bigger problem is that a version of the idea was attempted by Trump in his first term, and blocked in court. The new order may run into the same brick wall before it can deliver any benefits.",
      "The back-and-forth points to a unique tendency for Trump in his second term: a reluctance to attempt bipartisanship, even when there is significant overlap with Democrats on a goal.",
      "Instead, Trump has repeatedly sought to go it alone \u2014 at risk of failure. The self-styled \u201cdealmaker\u201d is passing up opportunities for a deal, lest he have to share the victory with his political foes.",
      "It is a break from tradition. Presidents typically attempt to achieve congressional approval for their goals, knowing that legislation is the best way for a policy to overcome legal hurdles and \u2014 especially if it\u2019s bipartisan \u2014 to stand the test of time. Trump is taking a different route, relying on executive action and party-line bills to advance his agenda.",
      "The move on drug pricing is just the latest example. In recent weeks, Trump has hinted at support for raising taxes on upper earners, a goal that has virtually unanimous Democratic support and could turn into a bipartisan victory. Instead, he has repeatedly offered it up as a trial balloon for his party-line agenda bill, only for Republicans to shoot it down each time (and to question whether he\u2019s even serious about it).",
      "Another example is Trump\u2019s campaign promise of government-funded IVF treatments, a goal that Democrats are more supportive of than Republicans. Indeed, GOP lawmakers say they have no intention of advancing IVF funding in their bill. Yet there has been scant effort by Trump at a bipartisan deal that could deliver on the promise.",
      "The tendency helps explain why Trump signed fewer bills into law than any president since the 1950s during his first 100 days in office. Trump\u2019s GOP trifecta includes a paper-thin House majority and a 60-vote hurdle in the Senate to pass most legislation,\u00a0making his task of signing new laws even more complicated without any Democratic support.",
      "House Republicans still have a lot of work ahead of them to reach consensus on their massive bill for Trump's agenda, even as they start releasing key parts of legislative text for the package. Here's the latest from Capitol Hill:",

      "U.S. and China take major step toward easing trade war",
      "The United States and China announced a 90-day pause on most of their recent tariffs on each other, fueling hopes on Wall Street of a cooldown in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "The combined U.S. tariffs rate on Chinese imports will be cut to 30% from 145%, while China\u2019s levies on U.S. imports will be cut to 10% from 125%, the two countries said in a joint statement.",
      "The early morning announcement came after officials from the two countries met in Geneva over the weekend. It was the first face-to-face talks on the tariffs since President Donald Trump\u2019s shock \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement last month imposing 84% duties on Chinese imports, which subsequently climbed to 125% \u2014 and then to 145% a day later.",
      "The math: The new 30% rate is the sum of the 20% duty imposed during the first weeks of his second term in response to alleged Chinese inaction on fentanyl flows, alongside the 10% across-the-board tariff Trump has imposed on all countries.",
      "How the markets responded: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up more than 1,100 points, an increase of about 2.8%. With those gains, the Dow is now even for the year after having declined as much as 11%. Still, it remains 5.5% below the highs it reached in February. The S&P 500, the broadest stock index, added 3.3%.",
      "Note of caution: Some analysts have urged caution, noting that tariffs remain far higher than before Trump returned to office. That suggests many consumer goods \u2014 from cars and groceries to fireworks \u2014 are set to see price hikes. Federal data is set to provide a fresh inflation snapshot on Tuesday morning.",
      "\u201cThe full set of U.S. tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients Monday, noting that the 90-day countdown \u201cshould keep uncertainty high for both investors and businesses.\u201d",

      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka\u2019s arrest last week at a federal immigration detention facility could shake up the New Jersey governor\u2019s race, as Baraka looks to appeal to progressive Democratic voters to win the crowded primary.",
      "Baraka is one of six Democrats on the June 10 primary ballot, and he has been campaigning for months as an unapologetic progressive but has been vastly outspent spreading that message on the airwaves. His arrest Friday at the facility, known as Delaney Hall, could boost his profile just as Democratic voters look for a candidate willing to fight President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting to uphold the Constitution the United States,\u201d Baraka told supporters on a call with a coalition of progressive groups Monday evening. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to uphold democracy that every single person deserves due process.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "LaVar Young, who chairs the pro-Baraka super PAC One New Jersey United, said Baraka\u2019s arrest shows \u201cthere\u2019s only been one candidate that\u2019s really been putting action behind his words.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Friday was just really a demonstration of what he\u2019s been doing over the last 30, 40\u00a0years of his career,\" Young later added, noting the super PAC expects to launch a digital ad highlighting Baraka\u2019s arrest later this week.\u00a0\"And I hope voters are able to see there\u2019s a difference between rhetoric and action.\"",
      "New Jersey is one of two states, along with Virginia, that are holding governor\u2019s races this year, which could provide indications about how voters are reacting to Trump\u2019s second term. The New Jersey Democratic primary is also one of the party's first significant internal contests following its 2024 loss to Trump \u2014 and amid its fractious deliberations about the party's path forward.",
      "The crowded race features Baraka,\u00a0Reps.\u00a0Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller, and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney. All but Spiller faced off in a debate on Monday night.",
      "At the debate, Baraka said his actions at the ICE detention center were an effective way to push back against the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what people need now. They need leadership. They don\u2019t need people to acquiesce, to hide in the middle, to run under this veil of \u2018I\u2019m working with the president of the United States,\u2019\u201d Baraka said. \u201cThe reality is, we need to protect families, we need to protect immigrants, we need to protect democracy.\u201d",
      "While some New Jersey political strategists view Sherrill as a leading candidate, the race is hotly contested. The most recent survey, from Rutgers' Eagleton Institute of Politics, showed all six Democratic primary contenders clustered from 7% to 17% support \u2014 and the gap between first place and last place within the poll's margin of error. Baraka\u2019s path to victory involves consolidating his party\u2019s liberal base and leveraging his support in Newark, the state\u2019s largest city, where he was first elected mayor in 2014. And his arrest could help him do just that.",
      "\u201cIf he can move a few thousand voters with a moment like this, it\u2019s meaningful,\u201d said one New Jersey Democratic operative granted anonymity to speak candidly about the race.",
      "The operative noted that the primary winner will not need a large percentage of the vote given how the crowded field will divide support. The person said Baraka\u2019s arrest could be a \u201cbig blow\u201d to Fulop as the two mayors have been battling for progressive voters.",
      "\u201cThis kind of a genuine, values-driven moment is huge for the type of voters that they\u2019re going for,\u201d the operative said.",
      "Each of Baraka\u2019s primary opponents condemned the arrest on Friday, calling it outrageous and demanding that he be released. The top two GOP candidates for governor, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and radio host Bill Spadea, slammed the arrest as a political stunt on the part of Baraka.",
      "\u201cI wish it was, then I wouldn\u2019t have to go to court on May 15,\u201d Baraka told Zeteo\u2019s Mehdi Hassan on Monday afternoon.",
      "Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., who sought to enter the detention center along with Reps. LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez on Friday, pushed back on the criticism that Baraka\u2019s arrest was a stunt.",
      "\u201cThe mayor doesn\u2019t do things just for performance. He does the things that he needs to do to protect the people,\u201d said Watson Coleman, who has endorsed Baraka in the primary.",
      "Baraka\u2019s campaign has been emphasizing his opposition to Delaney Hall, launching ads, including one over the weekend, that featured footage of the mayor at a protest there earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one progressive who Democrats trust: Ras Baraka,\u201d a narrator says in the 15-second spot. \u201cRas is the Democrat we trust to fight for working families, to make the wealthy pay their fair share, to stand up to Musk and Trump.\u201d",
      "The ad comes as other candidates have dominated the airwaves, also making the case that they will take on Trump.",
      "Gottheimer and his aligned super PACs have spent a combined $18.9 million on ads so far in the race this year, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Fulop and his aligned super PAC have spent a combined $14.3 million, while the pro-Spiller super PAC tied to the New Jersey teacher\u2019s union has spent $7.8 million. Baraka, Sweeney and Sherrill, and their aligned outside groups, have each spent around $2 million.",
      "While the candidates have pledged to take on Trump, they have also been making the case that they are best positioned to win in November, with the race expected to be competitive. Trump lost New Jersey by 6 percentage points last year, but that was 10 points better than his 2020 margin by 10 points, making it the state with second-largest swing toward Trump in the country.",
      "The Democratic operative noted that some in the party are concerned that Baraka may be too liberal for New Jersey's more moderate voters, who have supported Republicans for governor in the past.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a feeling among Democrats that if we do not nominate the right candidate we are in for a very, very difficult general election,\u201d the operative said, noting that the concern is heightened given that Ciattarelli could once again be the GOP nominee. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli on Monday.",
      "Ciattarelli lost a surprisingly close race to current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy by 3 points in 2021. Murphy was barred from running again in 2025 due to term limits.",
      "Ciattarelli weighed in Friday on Baraka\u2019s arrest, calling it \u201ccheap publicity stunt\u201d in a post on X, and accused Baraka of \u201cshilling for illegal immigrants\u201d amid ongoing chaos at Newark airport and scores of flight delays.",
      "The comment offered a preview of Republicans\u2019 potential case against Baraka, as well as how the party plans to focus on immigration in the governor's race. Immigration has been one of the few dividing lines in the Democratic primary, and it\u2019s a thorny issue for Democrats in a state where nearly one in four residents are immigrants. Republicans have leveraged the immigration issue, along with affordability, to make gains in the Garden State.",
      "\u201cI think for other Dems it\u2019s more complicated,\u201d a second New Jersey Democratic operative, who has worked for one of Baraka\u2019s primary opponents, wrote in a text message. \u201cBeing against \u2018a facility to hold criminals' is not a winning message. But the admin arresting elected officials is a better message for us to\u00a0push, and separate it from immigration issue.\u201d",
      "Watson Coleman dismissed concerns that Baraka is too liberal to win a general election, noting he is fighting for \u201chumane, foundational\u201d issues like access to affordable health care, housing and food. She said she decided to back Baraka over the other candidates, including two of her House colleagues, because of his governing experience.",
      "Democratic voters, Watson Coleman said, \u201care looking for representation. They are looking for someone that they think will look after their interests and their needs. They\u2019re looking for a person that will stand up for them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 A Russian spy ring plotted to trade blood diamonds for weapons in Africa and supply drones to Russia\u2019s military, according to messages shown to a London court that painted their fugitive leader as a wannabe James Bond.",
      "Jan Marsalek \u2014\u00a0who has been named as a key suspect in Germany\u2019s biggest postwar fraud case \u2014 is alleged to have led the team of six Bulgarians who were sentenced Monday at London\u2019s famous Old Bailey courthouse.",
      "When German payment company Wirecard collapsed in 2020, owing creditors almost $4 billion, Marsalek, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, went on the run and an international manhunt was launched for the Austrian national, who remains at large.",
      "Messages revealed in court made it clear he was in Moscow as he referred to meetings with the GRU and the FSB state security service, at their headquarters building known as the Lubyanka, and at a \u201cbonding exercise with the FSB guys at the shooting range.\u201d He even posed for a selfie in Russian military fatigues.",
      "Court documents also showed that, while he was on the run, he directed a ragtag group of amateur operatives: Orlin Roussev, 47; his second-in-command, Biser Dzhambazov, 44; and Ivan Stoyanov, a 33-year-old mixed martial arts fighter known as \u201cThe Rock.\u201d",
      "Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Vanya Gaberova, 30, described by prosecutors as \u201choneytrap\u201d agents, and competitive swimmer Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev, 39, made up the rest of the ring that carried out activities that, British police said, put lives and national security at risk.",
      "The spies conducted surveillance for the Russians targeting journalists, diplomats and dissidents in Britain, Austria, Spain and Montenegro, and they were paid handsomely for their services, prosecutors said.",
      "Using law enforcement grade devices called \u201cIMSI grabbers,\u201d prosecutors said they targeted the Patch Barracks, a U.S. base in Stuttgart, Germany, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to operate Patriot missile air defense batteries. This would have helped Russians to target them when they returned to Ukraine to operate the missile batteries, the court heard.",
      "However, following an investigation by Britain\u2019s MI5 spy service, they were arrested on Feb. 8, 2023, as they prepared to return to Germany with the devices hidden in a second-hand Chrysler.",
      "NBC News has contacted Russia\u2019s Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, known as GU, for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said the unit did not work directly for Russian intelligence and their members were motivated by financial gain. Investigators traced $225,000 but believe at least the same amount was paid in cryptocurrency, they said.",
      "In his sentencing, Judge Justice Hilliard said the large amounts of money paid to the six Bulgarian spies demonstrated the \u201cvalue\u201d of their covert activities to Russia.",
      "\u201cSome of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value.\u201d",
      "However, prosecutors said that Roussev led the spy ring from a rundown guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a seaside town on the east coast of England, where he stashed his huge collection of spy equipment, much of which he had adapted himself.",
      "Roussev pleaded guilty to spying for Russia in November and was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Dzhambazov was jailed for 10 years and two months and Stoyanov for seven years and seven months.",
      "Ivanova was found guilty in March along with Gaberova and Ivanchev. She was jailed for nine years and eight months. Gaberova and Ivanchev were sentenced to eight years each.",
      "As the sextet awaited sentencing, court documents revealed over 80,000 messages had been recovered from Roussev and Dzhambazov on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, following their arrest on Feb. 8, 2023.",
      "They shed light on the lifestyle of Marsalek in Moscow, revealing he partied with intelligence officers and naked girls, got cosmetic surgery to hide his identity and said he wanted to \u201coutperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "In a bid to show he was \u201cnot an anti-Western ideologue,\u201d Roussev\u2019s defense lawyers introduced messages with Marsalek which, they said, showed their client was \u201cfixing for money\u201d like \u201ceverything else Mr. Roussev does.\u201d",
      "The messages, which were not introduced by prosecutors as part of their Russian espionage allegations, showed the pair discussed a request to help evacuate U.S. and Afghan nationals from Afghanistan during the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from the country in August 2021.",
      "\u201cInteresting request from our (sort of) friends at the CIA,\u201d Marsalek said. \u201cThey urgently need aircraft to fly out contractors from Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know anyone who\u2019s a bit rogue and operates large-scale airplanes?\u201d",
      "The objective was \u201cto evacuate about 1,000 Afghan nationals\u201d and \u201c80 US citizens\u201d to Albania, in a deal he said was agreed between the Albanian and U.S. governments.",
      "Roussev said he would ask his father\u2019s pilot contacts in Africa and Marsalek replied: \u201cAmerica needs you, pax Americana rests on your broad and manly shoulders.\u201d",
      "Roussev later said the flight left Kabul shortly before an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a bomb outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killing 170 people and 13 American service members.",
      "Defending Roussev in court, King\u2019s Counsel Mark Summers said the request had come via a private company.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the pair were not acting on a humanitarian basis or at the direct request of the U.S. government.",
      "It remains unclear whether Roussev was successful in ensuring a flight.",
      "Roussev and Marsalek also discussed transporting diamonds in exchange for arms, the messages showed.",
      "In a June 2021 exchange, Marsalek asked whether African diamond sellers wanted guns in exchange or cash. \u201cThey usually buy guns, a lot of them,\u201d noting that he wasn\u2019t sure if rebel forces or the government would benefit from the deal. \u201cAllegedly only government, but who knows, this is Africa,\u201d he said.",
      "Three months earlier, Roussev messaged Marsalek to say he had been approached to supply 886,000 tons of wheat annually to the Cameroon government at a \u201cvery low price\u201d from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.",
      "Describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d considering the volume, he said that weapons and Sputnik COVID vaccines would likely be part of the transaction.\u201d Guns and sputnik = no problem,\u201d Marsalek replied. \u201cCan pretty much organize anything they need except nukes,\u201d he added, with a laughing emoji. \u201cEven the nukes if they pay.\u201d",
      "Other messages offered glimpses of Marsalek\u2019s life in exile and his efforts to stay ahead of authorities, including facial reconstruction.",
      "In May 2021, he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m trying to improve my skills on a few fronts, languages is one of them. In my new role as an international fugitive, I must outperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "Four months later, in September of that year, Marsalek apologized for being out of touch, saying he was \u201cstuck between the mafia, half of Russia\u2019s ambassadors, the GRU, a dozen naked girls and some deep-state guys whose names no one knows who forced me to drink a bottle of gin.\u201d",
      "Months later, he told Roussev he had \u201canother cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently.\u201d",
      "\u201cSleep well, sleep is the best fix for this condition,\u201d Roussev replied."

      "The \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d alum\u2019s post was the first he had uploaded since Dec. 10. At the time, he promoted \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d arriving on Netflix and shared a video of him talking about why the adaptation was meaningful. He also included behind-the-scenes footage of the cast and crew making the movie on set.",
      "Since he shared that clip, Justin Baldoni has been involved in an ongoing legal dispute with Lively, his \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-star.",
      "On Dec. 20, TODAY.com obtained an 80-page sexual harassment\u00a0 complaint filed by Lively in which she accused Justin Baldoni of creating a hostile workplace environment during filming and launching a smear campaign afterward to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation. In response to her claims, Justin Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, sent a statement to TODAY.com referring to the accusations as \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "About a week later, on Dec. 31, Lively filed a federal lawsuit against the actor and his production company, Wayfarer Studios. In the lawsuit, she alleged that there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,\u201d her attorney said in a statement shared with NBC News. She also named producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel in the lawsuit.",
      "Justin Baldoni sued The New York Times for libel for publishing an article about Lively\u2019s accusations.

He accused the parties of defamation and disregarding contractual claims.",

      "\u201cWhat I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It\u2019s what keeps us silent,\u201d Lively shared.",
      "She added, \u201cI acknowledge that many people don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak. I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It\u2019s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls. It\u2019s a pretty simple thing.\u201d",
      "In addition to attending Hollywood events, she has also remained active on Instagram, sharing multiple posts about \u201cAnother Simple Favor.\u201d",

Franco believes that fans picked up on \u201cthe energy that was given.\u201d He says that \u201cthe energy level was just very, very minimal.\u201d",
      "The chatter about the moment has been spreading around the Internet quickly, with many fans upset about the way his interviews were conducted.",
      "\u201cShah Rukh Khan getting barely 3 seconds at the Met Gala is criminal, but that interviewer not knowing who he was? Truly embarrassing, outrageous and disrespectful,\u201d one fan tweeted.\u00a0 Another called not knowing who he is as \u201ccultural erasure.\u201d",

      "Saleh says, more than anything, the controversy pointed to a \u201ccultural disconnect.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that someone can be so beloved yet still so virtually unknown within a media space as massive as the American one. It\u2019s a reminder of how fragmented global fame still is \u2014 and how moments like this, with a little help from social media, can spark meaningful conversations across cultures,\u201d she says.",

      "Walton Goggins hosted \u201cSNL\u201d for the first time May 10, alongside musical guest Arcade Fire. The \u201cRighteous Gemstones\u201d star got to show off his comedic chops throughout the night, including in the musical sketch, \u201cTiny Baby Shoe.\u201d",
      "The sketch followed Jane Wickline and Heidi Gardner as they walked through a zoo. Gardner was in the middle of telling Wickline a story before she spotted a single baby shoe abandoned on the ground, losing all focus.",
      "Wickline encouraged Gardner to go on without her before diving into a dramatic song about the \u201ctiny baby shoe.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomewhere there is a tiny Cinderella, well I'm coming for you little fella,\u201d Wickline sang at a keyboard placed over a grand piano. \u201cI got your shoe, so put it on, nice to meet you, now I'm your mom. If you've got a mom, well, now you've got two.\"",
      "Wickline dedicated her day to finding the shoe's rightful owner and fantasized about her future life, though none of the children she came across had the right sized feet.",

      "Wickline initially celebrated finding the owner of the tiny baby shoe, though Goggins seemed to have other ideas when it came to the exchange, singing, \u201cSurely this is fate! And you and I will date!\u201d",
      "The music came to a halting stop when Wickline said no and expressed confusion. Goggins explained the situation, adding, \u201cYou and I are going to date now, right? Because you found my shoe.\u201d",
      "Wickline clarified that she was looking for a baby, not a man, to which Goggins pointed out, \u201cNo, you thought you were looking for a baby, but you were looking for me. Ding dong, bing bong, here I am!\u201d",

      "After Sherman and Gardner revealed their footwear of choice, Goggins told them they were \u201cmaking a boy sweat over here.\u201d He then grabbed an ice cube out of Day\u2019s glass of water and began rubbing it on his bare chest underneath his half-unbuttoned shirt then plonked the cube right back into the water.",
      "Day didn't shy away from showing his irritation about the situation, telling Goggins that they were \u201cgood on the flirting with our moms,\u201d which was not met with kindness from their waiter.",
      "\u201cAre you lord Jesus?\u201d Goggins asked Day, who shook his head. \u201cThen don\u2019t be cross. Just because your mama baked you doesn\u2019t mean other men don\u2019t want to see the oven.\u201d",
      "Goggins continued to show his favoritism, gently handing Sherman and Gardner their menus before reluctantly tossing the other two menus onto the table in front of Day and Dismukes after they requested their own.",
      "The flirting only escalated from there. When Sherman asked if the mimosas were bottomless, Goggins replied, \u201cYes ma\u2019am, and maybe after you\u2019ve had a couple, you\u2019ll be too.\u201d",
      "Sherman tried to assure Day that their waiter was \u201charmless,\u201d though at the same time, Goggins blew his hot breath on the window of the kitchen door, drawing a heart in the condensation.",

      "The incessant flirting didn\u2019t stop there, either. After Sherman inquired about whether there were any butter substitutes since dairy would make her gassy, Goggins smoothly replied, \u201cSo? I\u2019ve never complained about a breeze blowing through my hair.\u201d",
      "As expected, that line did not go down well with Day or Dismukes who couldn\u2019t conceal their disgust after his comment.",

      "In the final two episodes of \u201cSt. Denis Medical\u2019s\u201d premiere season, Ron and Joyce\u2019s differences were on full display. In Episode 17, the two turned a fundraiser hospital gala into a verbal sparring session, with Joyce eventually seizing the mic to hijack Ron\u2019s hosting gig and make it a roast.",

    "summary": "Hamas said that it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living U.S. citizen held captive in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "An American-Israeli soldier held hostage for more than 19 months in the Gaza Strip was released by Hamas on Monday.",
      "Edan Alexander, who is believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was handed over to Red Cross representatives in the enclave\u2019s southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "The 21-year-old was then transfered to its special forces inside the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said in a statement Monday. They subsequently returned him to Israel where \u201che will undergo an initial medical assessment and meet with his family,\u201d the statement added. Pictures released by the IDF, showed a smiling Alexander hugging his parents Adi and Yael Alexander.",
      "President Donald Trump congratulated Alexander\u2019s \u201cwonderful parents, family, and friends,\u201d on the release in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Alexander's family earlier told NBC News that Trump had expressed the wish to meet with Alexander during his visit to Qatar later this week, but added that the meeting would be subject to Alexander\u2019s wishes and medical condition.",
      "Calling Alexander\u2019s release \u201ca very moving moment,\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the release was \u201cachieved thanks to our military pressure and the political pressure exerted by President Trump.\u201d",
      "Hamas confirmed the release earlier in the day. Shortly after Alexander was freed, the militant group said in a news release that the move was part of \u201cthe steps being taken to achieve a ceasefire, open the crossings, and allow aid\u201d into the Gaza Strip. \u201cWe urge the Trump administration to continue its efforts to end this brutal war,\u201d it added.",
      "Israel on Monday paused its military operations, including airstrikes and drone artillery, in Gaza ahead of the release, according to NBC News' crew on the ground.",
      "But Netanyahu's office said in a statement Monday that it was committing only to a safe corridor to allow Alexander\u2019s release, rather than any ceasefire or release of Palestinian prisoners\u00a0or detainees.",
      "\u201cWe are in critical days, during which Hamas has a proposal before it that would allow for the release of our hostages,\u201d the statement said, adding, \u201cNegotiations will continue under fire and alongside preparations to intensify the fighting.\u201d",
      "The Israeli security Cabinet last week approved a plan to capture the entire enclave under which more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza would be \u201cmoved\u201d out of the strip as Israel\u2019s military launched operations to defeat Hamas.",
      "Welcoming the news that he would be freed,  Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday said in a post on X that Israel is \u201cfounded on a profound commitment to mutual responsibility, and we are obligated to continue doing everything in our power to bring back all the hostages.\u201d",
      "The release comes as Trump is set to travel to the Middle East in a trip that is expected to intensify efforts to bring a pause to Israel\u2019s sweeping military offensive in the Gaza Strip, from which aid has been cut off for several weeks. The trip is not expected to include a stop in Israel.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social account Monday, Trump called Alexander\u2019s release \u201cgreat news.\u201d",
      "Alexander, 21, was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in New Jersey. He was serving in the Israeli army when Hamas captured\u00a0him during its terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage, according to Israeli counts, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Alexander\u2019s family confirmed in a statement Sunday that it was expecting his release. \u201cToday, on Mother\u2019s Day, we received the greatest gift imaginable\u2014news that our beautiful son Edan is returning home after 583 days in captivity in Gaza,\u201d it said.",
      "In his hometown of Tenafly, New Jersey, residents gathered in Huyler Park to celebrate the news and watch the events unfold on livestream screens.",
      "More than 52,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip since then, according to health officials in the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "On Monday, they said that Israeli strikes had killed 33 people and injured 94 others in the past 24 hours, adding that many more remain trapped under rubble.",
      "Alexander is one of 59 hostages remaining in Gaza, according to Israeli officials, although less than half are believed to be alive.",
      "Hamas previously reneged on an agreement to release Alexander in March, along with the bodies of four other dual nationals, saying it had lost contact with the group holding him and blaming Israel for targeting the area where he was allegedly being held with strikes.",
      "Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, told NBC News on Sunday that he was traveling to Israel to secure Alexander\u2019s release. \u201cWe are picking him up probably tomorrow,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cThere was a long negotiation with lots of people to thank.\u201d",
      "He added that it was a big moment \u201cin large part\u201d because of Trump.",
      "Trump on Sunday said that he hoped Alexander\u2019s release signified a step toward ending the war in Gaza. \u201cThis was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators \u2014 Qatar and Egypt \u2014 to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,\u201d Trump\u00a0wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Mediators Qatar and Egypt also welcomed the move in a statement Sunday.",
      "With Trump due to travel Tuesday to the region, this week may see further developments on growing diplomatic tensions between the president and Netanyahu, which sources have told NBC News have arisen over how to approach talks on Gaza and Iran. Netanyahu has denied the reports."

      "As for whether the pope is coming back to visit his hometown anytime soon, Holt said that seems unlikely. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd that falls in line with much of what we\u2019ve heard from experts here, that he\u2019s got a lot of work to do on this end, at the Vatican before we see him on the road,\u201d Holt added.",
      "The NBC Nightly News anchor described the unexpected encounter a \u201chighlight-of-the-career type moment for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs he greeted my fellow reporters and me at a gathering of journalists, my first thoughts were that he\u2019s very much a man at ease, and a man who seems very comfortable in his own skin, a man with a self-deprecating sense of humor,\u201d Holt said.",
      "\u201cOften, when top leaders work what we call a rope line and shake hands with people, there\u2019s this pressure to greet as many people as possible and it can feel hurried,\u201d Holt said. \u201cBut he seemed very willing to engage.\u201d",
      "The pontiff spoke with Holt after he made an impassioned plea for peace and expressed solidarity with imprisoned journalists in his first news briefing since becoming pope. Leo called for \u201cthe precious gift of free speech and of the press\u201d to be protected.",
      "Leo, 69, was elected last week as the first pope from the United States.",
      "While the bulk of the\u00a0audience appeared to consist of the legion of journalists who descended on the Vatican from around the world to cover Leo\u2019s selection, Holt said there also appeared to be a few non-reporters in the crowd who brought along babies to be blessed, and that the new pope happily obliged.",
      "There was also somebody who brought over a baseball for Leo to sign. The pontiff\u2019s family says he grew up a fan of the Chicago White Sox."

      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis\u2019 legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican and ideologically.",
      "Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis\u2019 final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses into what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy,\u201d as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first-round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \u201ca lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\u201d Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning, the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on papabili in the wake of Francis\u2019 death, once the conclave began, we don\u2019t know who the other front-runners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost\u2019s name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",

    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are \"worried about any deal\" President Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Israeli Prime\u00a0Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were closely aligned on how to approach the most pressing issues in their relationship: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran.",
      "Trump lifted a hold the Biden administration had put on sending large bombs to Israel. He encouraged Israeli military operations \u201cto finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza. He agreed with Netanyahu on confronting Iran and its proxy groups in the region.",
      "But in recent weeks, the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has become strained as the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling these challenges now that Hamas has been significantly degraded and Iran weakened, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "Where Netanyahu sees an opportunity to finally take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump sees an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal. As Israel hits Gaza with a new military offensive, Trump is pushing for a ceasefire and looking to implement his postwar plan for rebuilding the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d And after Trump halted the U.S. military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, a shocked Netanyahu said Israel would then defend itself.",
      "The recent differences between the two leaders on key strategies and positions has put Trump\u2019s relationship with one of America\u2019s closest allies at a bit of a crossroads. How they navigate their disagreements going forward will shape the outcome of some of the core components of the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Twice in just this past week alone, Trump made public comments that rankled Netanyahu, the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions said.",
      "Netanyahu\u00a0was particularly upset when Trump said Wednesday that\u00a0he had yet to decide\u00a0whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal his administration is negotiating, the two U.S. officials said. A top adviser to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, conveyed that message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting at the White House on Thursday, according to\u00a0one of the\u00a0U.S. officials.",
      "For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s decision to begin a new military offensive in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there, according to one of the U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the tensions between the two leaders.",
      "Privately, Trump has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make it harder to rebuild, according to those two sources.",
      "The U.S. is currently pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, which Dermer was set to discuss with Witkoff during his White House visit this week, according to the Middle Eastern diplomats and a senior Trump administration official.",
      "But\u00a0Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has been the biggest point of contention for Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli leader has been frustrated for weeks with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and his decision to instead\u00a0try to reach a deal aimed at blocking Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, according to the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about any deal,\u201d one of the U.S. officials said of the Israelis.",
      "Israel has made clear to the U.S. that it does not want Trump to cut a nuclear deal that leaves Iran with any uranium enrichment capabilities, the U.S. officials and Middle Eastern diplomats said. Trump has expressed an openness to Iran maintaining a civilian nuclear program.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when asked if the U.S. position is that Iran can have a uranium enrichment program for civilian nuclear purposes.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d\u00a0James Hewitt, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement responding to this story. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East. As he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the president is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "A third U.S. official said the president\u2019s team has communicated with Israeli officials regularly about the status of negotiations with Iran, providing updates and coordinating on elements of a potential deal.",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u2018Trump has his own agenda\u2019",
      "Netanyahu was\u00a0blindsided \u2014 and infuriated \u2014\u00a0this past week\u00a0by Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0agreed to stop firing on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to\u00a0one of the U.S. officials and\u00a0the\u00a0two Middle East diplomats.",
      "The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel\u2019s main airport.",
      "When Netanyahu visited the White House last month, for the second time since Trump took office,\u00a0he hoped\u00a0the president\u00a0would pledge U.S. air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, according to the two Middle Eastern diplomats. The Israeli leader was taken aback when the president instead announced he would agree to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomats said.",
      "Netanyahu has privately said\u00a0he thinks\u00a0Trump\u2019s negotiations with Iran are a waste of time because Tehran will never hold up its end of any deal, according to the two U.S. officials. Israel has argued that Iran is so weakened by economic sanctions and the degradation of its proxies in the region that now is an ideal moment to take out its nuclear facilities, and it is concerned the window for doing so is closing while the U.S. negotiates, the officials said.",
      "Adding to that concern about timing,\u00a0Israeli military strikes\u00a0crippled Iranian strategic air defenses in October,\u00a0meaning manned aircraft conducting new strikes now\u00a0would not be as susceptible to being shot down. But the Iranians are rebuilding their air defenses.",
      "Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham said this week that the only acceptable Iran deal is one that completely stops Tehran from any uranium enrichment. They also urged Trump to submit any Iran nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.",
      "Asked about Cotton and Graham\u2019s comments, a fourth U.S. official said Witkoff is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Graham about Iran negotiations and briefed Cotton on them this past week.",
      "The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama was not ratified by the Senate, which allowed Trump to simply withdraw the U.S. from the agreement during his first term.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcomed the election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda,\u201d Frank Lowenstein,\u00a0a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration,\u00a0said during a virtual briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Iran and the U.S. deal with the Houthis are \u201canathema\u201d to Netanyahu, the prime minister does not have the political leverage in Washington or Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0base in Israel, said Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy\u00a0as a senior official during\u00a0the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cwhole political strategy and survival strategy is based on holding his coalition and holding his political base together,\u201d Goldenberg said in the briefing organized by J Street. \u201cAnd those folks love Trump, so for him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The strain\u00a0in\u00a0the relationship between\u00a0Trump and\u00a0Netanyahu comes as the president is set\u00a0to\u00a0travel to the Middle East next week, with stops\u00a0scheduled\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump\u00a0is not currently scheduled\u00a0to visit Israel\u00a0on this trip, though he did during his first term.",
      "Witkoff also\u00a0planned to\u00a0attend another round of negotiations with Iran this weekend in Oman."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 A Russian spy ring plotted to trade blood diamonds for weapons in Africa and supply drones to Russia\u2019s military, according to messages shown to a London court that painted their fugitive leader as a wannabe James Bond.",
      "Jan Marsalek \u2014\u00a0who has been named as a key suspect in Germany\u2019s biggest postwar fraud case \u2014 is alleged to have led the team of six Bulgarians who were sentenced Monday at London\u2019s famous Old Bailey courthouse.",
      "When German payment company Wirecard collapsed in 2020, owing creditors almost $4 billion, Marsalek, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, went on the run and an international manhunt was launched for the Austrian national, who remains at large.",
      "Messages revealed in court made it clear he was in Moscow as he referred to meetings with the GRU and the FSB state security service, at their headquarters building known as the Lubyanka, and at a \u201cbonding exercise with the FSB guys at the shooting range.\u201d He even posed for a selfie in Russian military fatigues.",
      "Court documents also showed that, while he was on the run, he directed a ragtag group of amateur operatives: Orlin Roussev, 47; his second-in-command, Biser Dzhambazov, 44; and Ivan Stoyanov, a 33-year-old mixed martial arts fighter known as \u201cThe Rock.\u201d",
      "Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Vanya Gaberova, 30, described by prosecutors as \u201choneytrap\u201d agents, and competitive swimmer Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev, 39, made up the rest of the ring that carried out activities that, British police said, put lives and national security at risk.",
      "The spies conducted surveillance for the Russians targeting journalists, diplomats and dissidents in Britain, Austria, Spain and Montenegro, and they were paid handsomely for their services, prosecutors said.",
      "Using law enforcement grade devices called \u201cIMSI grabbers,\u201d prosecutors said they targeted the Patch Barracks, a U.S. base in Stuttgart, Germany, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to operate Patriot missile air defense batteries. This would have helped Russians to target them when they returned to Ukraine to operate the missile batteries, the court heard.",
      "However, following an investigation by Britain\u2019s MI5 spy service, they were arrested on Feb. 8, 2023, as they prepared to return to Germany with the devices hidden in a second-hand Chrysler.",
      "NBC News has contacted Russia\u2019s Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, known as GU, for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said the unit did not work directly for Russian intelligence and their members were motivated by financial gain. Investigators traced $225,000 but believe at least the same amount was paid in cryptocurrency, they said.",
      "In his sentencing, Judge Justice Hilliard said the large amounts of money paid to the six Bulgarian spies demonstrated the \u201cvalue\u201d of their covert activities to Russia.",
      "\u201cSome of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value.\u201d",
      "However, prosecutors said that Roussev led the spy ring from a rundown guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a seaside town on the east coast of England, where he stashed his huge collection of spy equipment, much of which he had adapted himself.",
      "Roussev pleaded guilty to spying for Russia in November and was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Dzhambazov was jailed for 10 years and two months and Stoyanov for seven years and seven months.",
      "Ivanova was found guilty in March along with Gaberova and Ivanchev. She was jailed for nine years and eight months. Gaberova and Ivanchev were sentenced to eight years each.",
      "As the sextet awaited sentencing, court documents revealed over 80,000 messages had been recovered from Roussev and Dzhambazov on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, following their arrest on Feb. 8, 2023.",
      "They shed light on the lifestyle of Marsalek in Moscow, revealing he partied with intelligence officers and naked girls, got cosmetic surgery to hide his identity and said he wanted to \u201coutperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "In a bid to show he was \u201cnot an anti-Western ideologue,\u201d Roussev\u2019s defense lawyers introduced messages with Marsalek which, they said, showed their client was \u201cfixing for money\u201d like \u201ceverything else Mr. Roussev does.\u201d",
      "The messages, which were not introduced by prosecutors as part of their Russian espionage allegations, showed the pair discussed a request to help evacuate U.S. and Afghan nationals from Afghanistan during the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from the country in August 2021.",
      "\u201cInteresting request from our (sort of) friends at the CIA,\u201d Marsalek said. \u201cThey urgently need aircraft to fly out contractors from Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know anyone who\u2019s a bit rogue and operates large-scale airplanes?\u201d",
      "The objective was \u201cto evacuate about 1,000 Afghan nationals\u201d and \u201c80 US citizens\u201d to Albania, in a deal he said was agreed between the Albanian and U.S. governments.",
      "Roussev said he would ask his father\u2019s pilot contacts in Africa and Marsalek replied: \u201cAmerica needs you, pax Americana rests on your broad and manly shoulders.\u201d",
      "Roussev later said the flight left Kabul shortly before an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a bomb outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killing 170 people and 13 American service members.",
      "Defending Roussev in court, King\u2019s Counsel Mark Summers said the request had come via a private company.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the pair were not acting on a humanitarian basis or at the direct request of the U.S. government.",
      "It remains unclear whether Roussev was successful in ensuring a flight.",
      "Roussev and Marsalek also discussed transporting diamonds in exchange for arms, the messages showed.",
      "In a June 2021 exchange, Marsalek asked whether African diamond sellers wanted guns in exchange or cash. \u201cThey usually buy guns, a lot of them,\u201d noting that he wasn\u2019t sure if rebel forces or the government would benefit from the deal. \u201cAllegedly only government, but who knows, this is Africa,\u201d he said.",
      "Three months earlier, Roussev messaged Marsalek to say he had been approached to supply 886,000 tons of wheat annually to the Cameroon government at a \u201cvery low price\u201d from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.",
      "Describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d considering the volume, he said that weapons and Sputnik COVID vaccines would likely be part of the transaction.\u201d Guns and sputnik = no problem,\u201d Marsalek replied. \u201cCan pretty much organize anything they need except nukes,\u201d he added, with a laughing emoji. \u201cEven the nukes if they pay.\u201d",
      "Other messages offered glimpses of Marsalek\u2019s life in exile and his efforts to stay ahead of authorities, including facial reconstruction.",
      "In May 2021, he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m trying to improve my skills on a few fronts, languages is one of them. In my new role as an international fugitive, I must outperform James Bond.\u201d",
      "Four months later, in September of that year, Marsalek apologized for being out of touch, saying he was \u201cstuck between the mafia, half of Russia\u2019s ambassadors, the GRU, a dozen naked girls and some deep-state guys whose names no one knows who forced me to drink a bottle of gin.\u201d",
      "Months later, he told Roussev he had \u201canother cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently.\u201d",
      "\u201cSleep well, sleep is the best fix for this condition,\u201d Roussev replied."

    "summary": "The U.S. and China said they had agreed to a 90-day pause on most of the tariffs they have imposed on each other since last month.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The United States and China announced a 90-day pause on most of their recent tariffs on each other, fueling hopes on Wall Street of a cooldown in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "The combined U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will be cut to 30% from 145%, while China\u2019s levies on U.S. imports will fall to 10% from 125%, the countries said early Monday morning.",
      "Officials met in Geneva over the weekend for their first face-to-face talks since President Donald Trump's shock tariff rollout on April 2, when he imposed 84% duties on Chinese imports, adjusted them to to 125% soon afterward, and hiked them further to 145% a day later.",
      "The new 30% rate is the sum of the 20% duty Trump imposed early in his second term over alleged Chinese failures to curb fentanyl flows and the 10% universal tariff he has applied to nearly all foreign imports.",
      "Markets surged on news of the detente. The broad-based S&P 500 was trading 3.1% higher Monday afternoon, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 1,100 points, a roughly 2.7% gain. The tech-focused Nasdaq surged 4.1%.",
      "European indexes posted modest gains Monday. Markets across Asia had upbeat sessions as well ahead of the news, anticipating some kind of trade agreement and also welcoming a ceasefire between India and Pakistan that largely seems to be holding. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index soared on news of the U.S.-China agreement, closing more than 3% higher.",
      "Yet some analysts have urged caution, noting that tariffs remain far higher than before Trump regained office. That suggests many consumer goods \u2014 from cars and groceries to fireworks \u2014 are set to see price hikes. Federal data is set to provide a fresh inflation snapshot on Tuesday morning.",
      "\u201cThe full set of U.S. tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients Monday, noting that the 90-day countdown \u201cshould keep uncertainty high for both investors and businesses.\u201d",
      "The U.S.'s effective tariff rate would now be 17.8%, the highest since 1934, which Yale Budget Lab researchers estimated Monday would dent households' annual purchasing power by $2,800.",
      "The United States has a larger goods trade deficit with China than with any other country, and Trump has often accused it of \u201cripping off\u201d the U.S. through unfair trade practices. Unlike other U.S. trading partners, Beijing responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs and other countermeasures that escalated into a dizzying game of one-upmanship.",
      "The dueling import taxes were \u201cthe equivalent of an embargo,\u201d which neither side wanted, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \u201cWe do want trade, we want more balanced trade, and I think that both sides are committed to achieving that,\u201d he said.",
      "Bessent, who represented the U.S. in the talks with Beijing along with Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, rejected suggestions that negotiating right away would have been more productive than triggering a tariff spat that caused global financial turmoil, saying that a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d effort to rebalance trade would not have worked.",
      "The U.S. and China now have \u201ca mechanism to avoid the upward tariff pressure,\u201d Bessent told CNBC Monday. \u201cI would imagine that in the next few weeks we will be meeting again to get rolling on a more fulsome agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Greer noted that separate discussions on fentanyl were \u201con a very positive track.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the agreement was an  \u201cimportant step\u201d and \u201ccreates favorable conditions for further narrowing differences and deepening cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is hoped that the U.S. will build on the foundation of this meeting, continue to work in the same direction with China\u201d and \u201ccompletely correct its unilateral tariff practices,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
      "Bessent emphasized that the U.S. does not want a broad-based \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China, preferring instead a \u201cstrategic decoupling, because we realized during Covid that efficient supply chains were not secure supply chains,\u201d he told MSNBC. \u201cSo with steel, with semiconductors, with medicines, with a couple of other strategic categories, we are going to have to become self-reliant again.\u201d",
      "Tariff impacts are already being felt across the United States, with  shipping volumes from China falling sharply since early April. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said Monday that the 90-day reprieve was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d that it hoped could \u201ccreate the long-term predictability our customers need.\u201d",
      "The agreement is also good news for small and medium-sized businesses \u201con both sides of the Pacific,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. It should be \u201ca very big relief for struggling small Chinese exporters, some of which have already lost U.S. orders for weeks,\u201d while American buyers are gaining some breathing room over surging costs, he said in emailed comments.",
      "The agreement exceeded expectations and has \u201crekindled global hope,\u201d said Wang Wen, dean of the\u00a0Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. But Xu and Wang both cautioned that many difficult issues remain to be resolved.",
      "\u201cThis situation is a major test of the political wisdom and negotiation capability of the decision-makers in both China and the U.S.,\u201d Wang said.",
      "Ahead of the bilateral talks in Geneva, Trump had expressed willingness to slash tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 80%, saying that level \u201cseems right\u201d but leaving the decision to Bessent.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t get any higher,\u201d Trump told reporters late last week. \u201cIt\u2019s at 145, so we know it\u2019s coming down.\u201d"

      "The leaders of four major European powers traveled to Kyiv on Saturday and demanded an\u00a0unconditional 30-day ceasefire\u00a0starting Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin, implicitly rejecting the offer, instead proposed\u00a0direct Russia-Ukraine\u00a0talks\u00a0in Istanbul that he said could potentially lead to a ceasefire.",

      "The air force said in its morning readout that\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0came under attack overnight from 108 long-range combat drones starting at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), an hour before the ceasefire was due to kick in. Attacks of this kind unfold over the course of hours, as drones fly much slower than missiles.",

      "The state of play on the sprawling front line was not immediately clear. The military has not yet given a readout that specifically addresses the period from midnight.",

      "Kyiv is desperate to unlock more of the U.S. military backing it received from Trump\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden. Moscow senses an opportunity to get relief from a barrage of economic sanctions and engage with the world\u2019s biggest economy.",
      "Europe, meanwhile, is doing its best to preserve good relations with Trump despite him\u00a0imposing tariffs, hoping it can persuade him to swing more forcefully behind\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s cause, which they see as central to the continent\u2019s security.",
      "A group of European foreign ministers and E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas were set to hold talks in London on Monday.",
      "The\u00a0leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland on Saturday threatened Russia with new sanctions if the truce was violated, though it is unclear what firepower they are able to muster on that front in the near term.",
      "Putin dismissed what he said was an attempt to lay down \u201cultimatums.\u201d His foreign ministry spelled out that talks about the root causes of the conflict must precede discussions of a ceasefire.",
      "With Russian forces grinding forward, the Kremlin chief has offered few, if any, concessions so far. Russia says a ceasefire would allow\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0to catch its breath and rebuild its military.",

      "CHICAGO \u2014 As the first pope from the United States and a dual citizen of America and Peru, Pope Leo XIV \u2014 a native of the Windy City \u2014 is emerging as a symbol of hope for those seeking a more compassionate approach to immigration, standing in sharp contrast to President Donald Trump\u2019s divisive policies.",
      "Despite their global influence, Leo and Trump represent starkly different visions. As Trump does everything in his power to deliver on his campaign promise of mass deportations, the newly elected pope sent another message to the world when he chose his papal name.",
      "By choosing Leo XIV, the pope made a deliberate nod to Pope Leo XIII, a champion of Catholic social teaching and a defender of human dignity during the Industrial Revolution. The choice reflects a commitment to justice and equality, echoing the struggles of workers and immigrants.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s Catholic social teaching,\u201d which was founded by Pope Leo XIII over a century ago, said Father Brendan Curran, who like Pope Leo XIV grew up on the South Side of Chicago.",
      "Catholic social teaching affirms the right of individuals to migrate in pursuit of safety and a dignified life. It also acknowledges that no country is obligated to accept every individual who seeks to resettle there, according to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Nonetheless, nations are called to regulate their borders \u201cwith justice and mercy.\u201d",
      "This last principle underscores the tension created by the Trump administration, which has terminated a number of legal immigration programs,\u00a0such as\u00a0the original CBP One app,\u00a0refugee programs\u00a0and\u00a0temporary protected status \u2014 and is now fast-tracking deportations, raising questions around due process violations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why his name is so important\u201d Curran said, hoping this is the first step \u201cat the world stage\u201d to \u201cconsider the dignity of people first. And secondarily, details of policy that follow from their dignity.\u201d",
      "A first-generation immigrant of Irish descent, Curran works with The Resurrection Project, a grassroots advocacy organization formed by six local parishes 35 years ago to advocate for immigrant rights, health care and affordable housing in southwest Chicago.",
      "Curran is optimistic that Leo XIV\u2019s background will shape his immigration stance.",
      "Born as Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, Leo grew up in the vibrant immigrant community on the city\u2019s South Side. His father, Louis Marius Prevost, was of French descent. And his mother, Mildred Martinez Prevost, was of Spanish heritage.",
      "Before his papacy, Leo worked in Peru for more than two decades and became a\u00a0naturalized Peruvian citizen in 2015. He started as a missionary, then became a priest and ultimately a bishop in the city of Chiclayo. He even helped build a shelter for migrants there and was praised in Peru for supporting Venezuelan immigrants fleeing the humanitarian crisis in their homeland.",
      "\u201cHe was basically an American immigrant in Latin America,\u201d said Evelin Maroldt, a Venezuelan immigrant of Polish and German heritage living in Chicago. \u201cIf he knows what that feels like, it may help us,\u201d Maroldt said in Spanish, adding she now has \u201chigh expectations\u201d for the new pope. \u201cOne of the things is more support for all the immigrants around the world who are struggling a lot.\u201d",
      "As she crafted her signature \u201ccaf\u00e9 mandala\u201d at a coffee shop in Chicago\u2019s Pilsen neighborhood Saturday afternoon, Maroldt reminisced about witnessing Pope John Paul II\u2019s visit to Venezuela when she was a toddler. As a Catholic, Maroldt hopes to witness another pope visit \u2014 this time, in Chicago.",
      "Chicago became an epicenter of the nation\u2019s immigration debate in 2022, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused migrants here to create pressure for stricter border policies. With the sudden arrival of more than 50,000 migrants, city officials struggled\u00a0to meet the demand for housing and social services while addressing criticism over the use of public funds to provide services for the newcomers.",
      "For Peruvian immigrant Daniel Flores, Leo\u2019s perspective could make him a strong advocate for immigrants and against Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cThis is a plight, not just of the U.S.,\u201d Curran said about implementing humane immigration policies. \u201cThe open question of how we treat immigrants is a world conflict,\u201d he said, adding that policies have repeatedly failed immigrants and \u201cour peoples of the world.\u201d",
      "Balancing political views and the Catholic faith",
      "Leo has yet to speak about his views on immigration since becoming pope last week. But past social media posts \u2014 some of which are critical of Trump and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 suggest he supports protecting immigrants. His brother John Prevost also told The New York Times he knows Leo is \u201cnot happy with what\u2019s going on with immigration. I know that for a fact. How far he\u2019ll go with it is only one\u2019s guess, but he won\u2019t just sit back. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be the silent one.\u201d",
      "Still, Trump expressed pride at having an American in charge at the Vatican.",
      "Born in immigrant-rich Chicago and having served in South America, Leo brings \u201can important perspective\u201d on immigration issues, Curran said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of pride that immigrant peoples have formed the pope.\u201d",
      "As the first Augustinian friar to become pope, Leo\u2019s immigration views may also reflect the core values of his religious order: community, charity and humility.",
      "The contrast between Trump and the pope is almost \u201cthe perfect antithesis,\u201d highlighting that Americans are not a monolith, Flores said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge contrast.\u201d",
      "Flores, a trumpet player, was on his way to St. Procopius Catholic Church in Pilsen on Saturday afternoon to perform at a Mass honoring Mexico\u2019s Virgin of Light. Since learning of Leo\u2019s ties to both Chicago and Peru, he said, \u201cI feel like we got a direct line, especially Peruvians in Chicago.\u201d",
      "Even after growing up in a traditional Catholic household, \u201cI feel a lot closer to God now,\u201d Flores said.",
      "In Chicago, discussions about the new pope are shedding light on persistent divides within the U.S. Catholic Church \u2014 a challenge Leo is expected to tackle. These divisions mirror the nation\u2019s broader political polarization over issues such as immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Overall, Catholics voted for Trump 59%-39% over Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, a 12-percentage point swing from 2020, according to Edison Research exit polls. The shift may reflect the influence of Trump-era culture wars on conservative media, coupled with the sway of the Catholic Church.",
      "Some Catholics like sisters Kaitlyn and Megan Reznicek, both elementary school teachers from the western Chicago suburbs, view Leo as someone who could potentially soften stark divides.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad to me that the papacy often, just like the church, can get so caught up in the divisive politics of the day,\u201d Kaitlyn said. But having a pope that understands U.S. party politics while being more aware of what is happening internationally is crucial to uniting the Catholic Church, Megan said.",
      "The sisters said their Catholic faith shapes their politics \u2014 conservative on abortion but liberal on the environment and immigration. Flores said his Catholic faith inspires him to be selfless, care for the less fortunate and support social programs \u2014 values that align more closely with progressive politics.",
      "The pope\u2019s brother even described the new pontiff as \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d Leo\u2019s own voting records show he participated in both Democratic and Republican primaries. While Leo appears to be in favor of protecting immigrants, he also opposed abortion and teachings on gender identity in schools during his time in Peru.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t fit into a particular mold,\u201d Kaitlyn said of the pope. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the reality of the Catholic Church. We are not a political conservative group or a political leftist or a progressive group. But we are the Church of Christ.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s a testament to the universality of the church,\u201d she added."

      "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014\u00a0Wall Street stock futures climbed and the dollar firmed against safe haven peers on Monday as signs of progress in\u00a0U.S.-China trade\u00a0talks raised hopes that a global recession might be avoided, though specifics were still sorely lacking.",
      "Geopolitical tensions also looked to be easing as a fragile ceasefire held between\u00a0India and Pakistan, while Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0said he was ready to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Turkey on Thursday for talks.",
      "Over in Geneva, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touted \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in trade discussions, while Chinese officials said the two sides had reached \u201cimportant consensus\u201d and agreed to launch another new economic dialogue forum.",
      "A joint statement is expected later on Monday, though it was notable that neither side mentioned tariff rates specifically.",
      "\u201cWhat we seem to have here, then, is a broad framework under which the two nations can conduct further talks, with the aim of reaching a broader trade agreement,\u201d said Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone.",
      "\u201cNot the worst-case outcome that was possible from this weekend\u2019s talks, far from it, but not a concrete deal either,\u201d he added. \u201cDoes this progress allow for any tariffs to be paused, reduced or rolled back, and if so for how long?\u201d",
      "Investors\u00a0are hoping the White House will soon scale back the 145% tariff on Chinese goods, even if only back to the 60% first flagged by President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump still seems wedded to keeping broad tariffs in place no matter what, which will drag on economic growth and push up prices, but any trade progress could help dodge a sharp downturn.",
      "Markets\u00a0reacted by pushing S&P 500 futures\u00a0up 1.2%, while Nasdaq futures\u00a0rose 1.4%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures\u00a0firmed 0.9%, while FTSE futures\u00a0added 0.4% and DAX futures\u00a00.7%.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei\u00a0edged up 0.3%, while South Korea\u2019s\u00a0Kospi\u00a0gained 0.4%.",
      "Chinese blue chips\u00a0firmed 0.8%, though data\u00a0over the weekend showed\u00a0factory-gate prices\u00a0posted the steepest drop in six months in April while consumer prices fell for a third month.",
      "The dollar added 0.4% on the safe haven yen to reach 145.90, though it was off an early five-week peak of 146.31. The euro dipped 0.2% to $1.1224\u00a0and the dollar index edged up 0.2% to 100.60.",
      "The dollar also dipped 0.2% on the offshore Chinese yuan to 7.2278, and back toward last week\u2019s low of 7.1846."

      "GENEVA \u2014 The U.S. treasury secretary and America\u2019s top trade negotiator began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland Saturday aiming to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and damage the global economy.",
      "China\u2019s Xinhua News Agency says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.",
      "Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks wasn\u2019t made public. However, a motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations in the wealthy Swiss city, and a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon.",
      "Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they\u2019ve slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries\u2019 boycotting each other\u2019s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u201d",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\u201cThe best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\u201d she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \u201cIt cannot just be words.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump\u2019s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China\u2019s subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn\u2019t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China\u2019s tech policy now resumes.",
      "Trump is also agitated by America\u2019s massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he\u2019s reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",
      "The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.",
      "The United States is Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the EU \u2014 a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free."
