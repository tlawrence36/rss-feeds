      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

      "HOUSTON -- The woman convicted of killing Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla-Perez has been denied parole after spending decades behind bars for fatally shooting the young singer at a Texas motel in 1995, the state\u2019s parole board announced Thursday.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar is serving a life sentence at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas. A three-member panel of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted to not release her. The panel said her case will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "The singer known to her fans as simply Selena was one of the first Mexican-Americans to make it into the mainstream music scene and was on the verge of crossing over into the English-language pop market when she was killed.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and had been the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena a Corpus Christi native, was 23 years old when she was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified that Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a nine-hour standoff with police. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena, but that the gun misfired.",
      "On October 23, 1995, a jury in Houston convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",
      "While in prison, Sald\u00edvar \u2014 a former nurse \u2014 obtained her paralegal and associate degree in criminal justice and has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records. She also helped other inmates to file petitions.",
      "In court documents filed in 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction but all were rejected.",
      "Selena \u2014 \u201cthe Queen of Tejano\u201d \u2014 rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits include \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",

      "At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began",
      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order on the Smithsonian Institution that targets funding to programs that contain what he calls \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \u201cat Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\u201d",

      "A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault has told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set",
      "PARIS -- A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris on Wednesday that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d). He denies any sexual assault.",
      "Day 3 of the Paris trial focused on the testimony of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.",
      "\u201cOut of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,\u201d she said, adding she was \u201cunder shock,\u201d \u201cpetrified,\u201d and said nothing.",
      "In a second incident, she said Depardieu suddenly put both his hands on her breasts: \u201cI said no, I was scared.\"",
      "She also described telling Depardieu \u201cno\u201d during a third similar incident.",
      "The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.",
      "Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations Wednesday in court, saying : \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that maybe, I don\u2019t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,\" Depardieu said. \"But I\u2019m not only that. I still respect people.\u201d",
      "The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his body guard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.",
      "On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault. He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to. Neither women has done so in this case.",
      "The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- In West Philadelphia where he was born and raised, now there\u2019s a street called Will Smith Way.",
      "Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker and city leaders honored the Oscar and Grammy winner on Wednesday, renaming a street next to Smith's old high school.",
      "\u201cPhilly, I love you. I am yours. You are mine,\u201d Smith said at a ceremony along a section of 59th Street that now bears his name.",
      "He reminisced about learning the values of hard work and education from his mother and father before hitting it big as an actor and rapper.",
      "\u201cNobody gets an easy ride,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of the things these streets of Philadelphia taught me: that there's nothing wrong with a hard day's work.\u201d",
      "Among those who came out to see him was a former teacher who was the first to call him \u201cPrince Charming\u201d \u2014 a nickname he changed up a bit for the 1990s TV show \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d in which Smith played a teenager from Philadelphia who goes to live with relatives in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThe name `The Fresh Prince' was coined in that building,\" Smith said, pointing back at Overbrook High School. \u201cI added the \u2018fresh\u2019 because it was hip-hop slang.\"",

      "With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, G\u00e9rard Depardieu reigned over cinema for half a century",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "Thirty years ago, music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. For the last three decades, Sald\u00edvar has served her life sentence in Texas.",
      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "Known the world over as The Queen of Tejano, or even more simply just as Selena, she broke barriers for women in Latin music. She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",
      "The governor cannot veto a parole decision by the pardons board. The governor, upon recommendation by a majority of the pardons board, can grant clemency. That includes pardons, commutations and reprieves.",

      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",

      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",

      "The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",
      "The balloons soar 100,000 feet in the air with sensors called radiosondes hanging about 20 feet below them that measure temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.",
      "\u201cThe thing about weather balloons is that they give you information you can't get any other way,\u201d said D. James Baker, a former NOAA chief during the Clinton administration. He had to cut spending in the agency during his tenure but he said he refused to cut observations such as weather balloons. \u201cIt's an absolutely essential piece of the forecasting system.\u201d",
      "University of Oklahoma environment professor Renee McPherson said, \u201cThis frankly is just dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBad,\u201d Ryan Maue, who was NOAA's chief scientist at the end of President Donald Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \u201cWe should not degrade our weather system by skipping balloon launches. Not only is this embarrassing for NOAA, the cessation of weather balloon launches will worsen America's weather forecasts.\u201d",
      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of fun to do,\u201d Friday said on Friday.",

      "The demonstrations began last week following the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Imamoglu was jailed pending trial on corruption charges many see as politically motivated and is also accused of supporting terrorism. The government insists the judiciary is independent, but critics say the evidence is based on secret witnesses and lacks credibility.",
      "Early Thursday, student demonstrators tried to march and gathered to read a statement near the gates at Middle East Technical University, pro-opposition broadcaster Halk TV and local media reported. They were met by security forces who deployed pepper spray, water cannon and plastic pellets. A standoff ensued where the students hid behind a barricade of dumpsters until the police charged to detain them.",

      "Demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of largely peaceful protesters have swept across major cities, including opposition-organized rallies outside Istanbul City Hall. Other major protests have been held in Istanbul\u2019s districts of Kadikoy and Sisli districts in recent days.",

      "British Steel says it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the north England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government",
      "LONDON -- British Steel said Thursday that it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the northern England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government.",
      "Unions called on the government to help secure the future of the company, which Jingye said is suffering daily losses of around 700,000 pounds ($900,000) despite the Chinese firm investing more than 1.2 billion to maintain operations since its takeover of British Steel in 2020.",
      "The company, Britain's second-biggest steelmaker, blamed \u201chighly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\u201d",
      "British Steel said it is consulting with unions over the the decision to close the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations and reduce rolling mill capacity, potentially as early as June. Between 2,000 to 2,700 jobs are potentially at risk.",
      "The company had sought support from the government for a major capital investment in two new electric arc furnaces, which would emit far less carbon into the atmosphere, but no agreement was reached after months of negotiations.",
      "Unions published a report last month setting out how to decarbonize steelmaking at British Steel, which would involve the continued operation of Scunthorpe\u2019s two existing blast furnaces while two new electric ones constructed on site. The plan would require an additional 200 million pounds of government support to mitigate carbon costs in the interim period.",
      "\u201cThis is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country,\" said Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union. \u201cThe closures at Scunthorpe would represent a hammer blow to communities which were built on steel, and where the industry still supports thousands of jobs directly and thousands more through extensive supply chains.\"",
      "Rickhuss urged Jingye and the government to get back to the negotiating table and said the Chinese company \u201chave not ruled out\" retaining the blast furnaces during a transition if they can win government backing.",
      "Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government will \u201ccontinue working tirelessly\u201d to reach an agreement with Jingye.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear there\u2019s a bright future for steelmaking in the U.K,\" he said.",
      "At its height in the postwar period, British steelmaking was a global leader, employing more than 300,000 people, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. It now employs about 40,000 directly, with the industry accounting for just 0.1% of the British economy.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military says North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February in continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February in continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, South Korea\u2019s military said Thursday in its latest assessment.",
      "The South\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea has also been sending more missiles, artillery equipment and ammunition to help Russia and that North Korea could increase its weapons supplies further depending on the war situation. Russia and Ukraine recently agreed on a limited ceasefire, though both sides have accused each other of violations.",
      "The military equipment North Korea has sent to Russia includes a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of short-range ballistic missiles, 170 millimeter self-propelled howitzers and around 220 units of 240 millimeter multiple rocket launchers.",
      "North Korea has sent approximately 11,000 military personnel to fight in the war against Ukraine in its first involvement in a large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War, and the Joint Chiefs assessed that around 4,000 of them have been killed or wounded.",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service previously attributed the high North Korean casualties to the troops\u2019 likely struggles in adapting to drones and other elements of modern warfare. North Korean troops are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have sent them into assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, the spy agency told lawmakers in January.",
      "Still, Ukrainian military and intelligence officials have assessed that the North Koreans are gaining crucial battlefield experience and have been key to Russia\u2019s strategy of overwhelming Ukraine by throwing large numbers of soldiers into the battle for Kursk.",
      "The South Korean military report came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian security official, Sergei Shoigu, last week in Pyongyang. State media reports said Kim and Shoigu reaffirmed their commitment to uphold a major mutual defense treaty agreed upon last year. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told Russian media on Thursday that the governments were discussing a potential visit by Kim to Moscow but did not specify when it might take place.",
      "\u201cWe always talk to everyone about exchanging visits. We are always preparing,\u201d he told RIA Novosti.",
      "Kim\u2019s military support of Russia has raised concerns that he may receive Russian technology transfers in return, further strengthening the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military. Experts say drones are among the potential areas where North Korea might seek to acquire Russian technology and know-how.",
      "North Korean state media said Thursday that Kim observed tests of newly developed reconnaissance and attack drones this week and called for their increased production. Kim in recent months has been emphasizing the development of drones, and the tests were the latest display of his country\u2019s growing military capabilities.",
      "Photos released by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency showed Kim observing what appeared to be a large reconnaissance drone roughly resembling Boeing\u2019s E-7 Wedgetail airborne warning and control aircraft. Other images showed exploding drones crashing into military vehicles used as targets.",
      "The agency said the test demonstrated the reconnaissance drone\u2019s ability to track multiple targets and monitor troop movements on land and at sea, potentially enhancing North Korea\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations and ability to neutralize enemy threats. The report said the new exploding drones are designed for various attack missions and feature unspecified artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the drones\u2019 performance and approved plans to expand production, emphasizing that drones and AI should be \u201ctop\u201d priorities in efforts to advance his armed forces and adapt them to modern warfare, KCNA said. The agency said the tests took place as Kim visited a drone technology complex and an electronic warfare research group on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Kim previously inspected other demonstrations of drones that explode on impact in November and August last year.",
      "When asked about the new reconnaissance drone, which North Korean state media unveiled for the first time, Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the North likely modified an existing aircraft to create an early-warning drone and may have used certain components from Russia. He said North Korea was possibly exaggerating the capabilities of the drone.",

      "A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled that former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his associates will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election",
      "SAO PAULO -- A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled that former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his associates will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election.",
      "The panel will review existing evidence, potentially gather new evidence and hear testimonies. Legal experts estimate that Bolsonaro could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison, though his actual jail time \u2014 if convicted \u2014 would be less than that due to procedural considerations.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about what will happen after Wednesday's ruling:",
      "Bolsonaro will stand trial on the counts of attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage characterized by violence and a serious threat against the state\u2019s assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.",
      "The five-justices panel of Brazil's Supreme Court ruled based on the indictment by Prosecutor-General, Paulo Gonet. His formal accusation came from a federal police investigation that placed Bolsonaro on the top of a criminal organization that had been active since at least 2021.",
      "Gonet also accused Bolsonaro of supporting a plan that allegedly included poisoning his successor, current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and killing Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.",
      "While a specific trial date has not been set, the chairman of the Supreme Court panel is expected to outline the procedural framework in the coming days.",
      "Elo\u00edsa Machado, a law professor at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas university in Sao Paulo, explained that the evidentiary phase of the criminal case, which includes defendant interrogations, witness testimony and further procedures such as expert examinations, begins. Many of those procedures will be conducted by auxiliary judges.",
      "\u201cThen, the rapporteur prepares a report and requests a trial date,\" Machado said. \u201cAfter this stage, prosecutors and defense attorneys will present their final arguments before the court rules on whether to acquit or convict.\"",
      "Bolsonaro\u2019s defense team had requested the case to be sent to the full Supreme Court, not just on the 5-justice panel, which could drag a ruling into 2026 as all 11 justices would have their say on the case. The request was denied.",
      "Brazil\u2019s top court is using one of its two permanent 5-justice panels to put Bolsonaro on trial. None of the five was appointed by Bolsonaro.",
      "As rapporteur of the case, justice de Moraes brought the charges to the one he sits on.",
      "The other four justices are C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia, considered one of the harshest on criminal cases; Cristiano Zanin, the chairman of the panel and Lula's attorney between 2013 and 2023; Fl\u00e1vio Dino, appointed by the leftist president in 2023 after serving as his justice minister; and Luiz Fux, the court's chief-justice between 2020 and 2022, considered a moderate.",
      "Brazilian criminal law mandates that arrests occur only after a final, unappealable conviction.",
      "The Supreme Court of Brazil, being the final appeals tribunal for criminal cases involving public authorities, possesses ultimate jurisdiction over Bolsonaro's case.",
      "If the former president takes any action that hampers the court\u2019s ability to deliver its ruling, such as seeking shelter in an embassy, he could be arrested before the trial ends.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has been banned from running for office until 2030 for abuse of power and undermining confidence in the country\u2019s voting system, has denied wrongdoing and claims he is the target of political persecution.",
      "\u201cIf I go to jail, I will give you a lot of work,\u201d Bolsonaro said after Wednesday's Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering by low court judge Sergio Moro in 2017, and had his sentence later upheld by a group of magistrates. He served more than a year and seven months in prison and was released after the Supreme Court changed its jurisprudence to forbid jail time for any Brazilian until all appeals are exhausted.",
      "In 2021, the same court annulled Lula's sentence as it found Moro to be biased. Moro left his position as a federal judge to become Bolsonaro's justice minister.",
      "Michel Temer, who governed between 2016 and 2018 after Dilma Rousseff was impeached, was acquitted by a federal court in 2024 in a corruption and money laundering case. He was briefly arrested in 2019 under the accusation of profiting from fraudulent contracts between state-run Eletronuclear and companies AF Consult Ltd and Engevix during his time as vice president.",
      "Fernando Collor, who governed between 1990 and his impeachment in 1992, was sentenced to eight years and ten months in jail in 2023 for his role in a corruption scheme at then state-run BR Distribuidora. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court last year, but Collor is yet to be imprisoned.",
      "The inclusion of high-ranking military officials to stand trial in Brazil's top court is unprecedented, as the country's transition from a military dictatorship to democracy in the 1980s was marked by a sweeping amnesty for military personnel.",
      "Four high-ranking military officials who operated under Bolsonaro will stand trial. These are former Defense Minister Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira; former Navy commander Almir Garnier Santos; retired Gen. Augusto Heleno, who headed the Institutional Security Office; and retired Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s chief of staff and defense minister.",
      "\"Four-star generals accused of plotting a coup are now likely to be convicted and punished under Brazil\u2019s democratic legal system,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Roberto Martins Filho, a political science professor at the Federal University of Sao Carlos and former president of the Brazilian Association of Defense Studies. \u201cAnyone who attempts a military-backed coup and fails could face consequences like what we\u2019re seeing now. They could end in prison.\u201d",

      "And U.N. spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric intensified that warning Thursday after Machar's arrest, saying: \u201cWe warn that this action takes the country yet one step closer to the edge of a collapse into civil war and the dismantling of the peace agreement.\u201d",
      "He said \"it is unimaginable that the political leaders would allow their country to go back into a state of bloody civil war and the tragedy that would ensue,\u201d adding that \u201cIt is vital that the leaders of the country put the interest of the people first and foremost.\"",

      "South Sudan\u2019s five-year civil war, in which 400,000 people were killed, ended in a 2018 peace agreement that brought President Salva Kiir and Machar together in a unity government. Machar is one of the five vice presidents in the country.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims have been pouring into the medieval hilltop town of Assisi in Italy to venerate the Catholic Church\u2019s newest saint",
      "ASSISI, Italy -- Pilgrims have been pouring into this medieval hilltop town to venerate not only two of the Catholic Church\u2019s most celebrated saints, Francis and Clare, but its newest \u2014 Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint, who will be canonized on April 27.",
      "\u201cSt. Francis, St. Clare, of course, important saints who marked an epoch \u2013 but that\u2019s far removed from today\u2019s teens. Carlo is like the kids,\u201d said Maria Rosario Riccio, a mother and educator who was visiting Acutis\u2019 shrine recently with a 50-strong parish youth group from southern Italy. \u201cHe\u2019s a near-saint of our time, who can show teens that it\u2019s possible to love Jesus while being a regular youth.\u201d",
      "The group lined up to enter the Santuario della Spogliazione \u2014 a somber church, also known as Santa Maria Maggiore, marking the spot where more than 800 years ago St. Francis renounced his family\u2019s wealth. There, they prayed by the monument where Acutis\u2019 body is on view, wearing jeans, a sweatshirt and sneakers.",
      "On that Saturday, hundreds filed past \u2014 a priest and his parishioners from the Azores islands, a nun from Colombia and her Passionist sisters, a family with two teens from near Venice. Some clutched rosaries, others took selfies or touched the protective glass in front of the seemingly sleeping young man, who died of leukemia at 15 in 2006 and is generating a devotion that astonishes even Assisi\u2019s bishop.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m seeing here a volcano of grace erupting \u2026 I can\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d said the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino. When he became bishop two decades ago, the church next to his residence just off the main street was \u201cforgotten\u201d by the throngs that visited the monumental Basilica of St. Francis.",
      "Over the last year, more than a million pilgrims paid homage to Acutis, Sorrentino said, drawn by \u201chis smiling way of living our faith.\u201d",
      "The teen\u2019s happy image, usually in a red polo shirt and carrying a backpack, is as popular in souvenir shops across town as Francis in his simple brown habit.",
      "One store owner picked up a blessed icon the first time she went to the shrine and keeps it glued to her cash register.",
      "\u201cI was really curious about this new saint who attracts youth,\u201d Silvia Balducci said.",
      "Both the church and his family describe Acutis as an exceptionally devout but otherwise regular Italian boy, who\u2019s working miracles after his untimely death precisely by drawing youth to faith when most of his contemporaries are abandoning organized religion.",
      "\u201cCarlo wasn\u2019t an alien, he was a normal person. But if it\u2019s illuminated by the light of Christ, a life becomes extraordinary,\u201d his mom, Antonia Salzano Acutis, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe always pray to the saints, and in the end, what did saints do? They opened the doors of their lives to Christ.\u201d",
      "She quoted one of her son\u2019s favorite phrases: \u201c\u2019Everyone is born an original, but many die photocopies.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe saint is one who didn\u2019t die like a photocopy, who realized that project of holiness that God established in eternity for each of us, as we all should,\u201d she said.",
      "Not an observant Catholic herself when she had him, Acutis used to joke with her husband that their young son was \u201ca little Buddha\u201d because of his unselfishness, attention to others, and cheerful obedience.",
      "He developed a precocious interest in faith, such as wanting to enter every church to \u201csay hi\u201d to Jesus and Mary. Later, he started attending Mass, adoring the Blessed Sacrament and praying the rosary daily \u2014 while also entertaining with jokes his friends who were less interested in religion and more into going to nightclubs with their girlfriends and smoking an occasional joint.",
      "\u201cThis was a bit of a way of hiding his faith life, because Carlo knew that his friends couldn\u2019t understand,\u201d his mother said. \u201cBut Carlo was a witness, a silent witness through the value of friendship, through the value of generosity, helping his classmates in school, defending the teens who were bullied.\u201d",
      "Acutis often helped the homeless and was uninterested in the trappings common for a wealthy child in Milan, one of Europe\u2019s fashion and business capitals. He asked his parents to donate to the poor what they would have spent for a second pair of sneakers for him, and insisted he wanted to teach catechism at his parish instead of going on skiing holidays at fancy resorts like his peers.",
      "That denial of privilege is a parallel with St. Francis, to whom Acutis was so devoted that he asked to be buried in Assisi, said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent most of his religious career there and heads the pontifical committee for World Children\u2019s Day.",
      "\u201cAnd there are more similarities with St. Francis. St. Francis left the churches and went to the squares to preach. Carlo Acutis prophetically realized that today the public squares are online, on the Web,\u201d Fortunato said. \u201cThat\u2019s where youth are, that\u2019s where people are, so he lives and brings the Gospel in those squares. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he will become the patron of the Web, Internet and social media.\u201d",
      "Particularly devout to the eucharist and wanting to share the Catholic belief that Jesus is literally present in it, Acutis created an online exhibit about miracles where the bread and wine became flesh and blood throughout the centuries. It\u2019s been used in thousands of parishes worldwide, his mother said.",
      "For her, his being \u201ca bridge to Jesus\u201d \u2014 even in his terminal illness, which he faced without complaining, certain of eternal life \u2014 is a more important legacy than any miracles or supernatural signs.",
      "To become a saint, however, miracles do need to be attested. One in Acutis\u2019 canonization process was the healing of a Costa Rican student from a bicycle accident in Italy after her mother prayed to him, Sorrentino said.",
      "Sabina Falcetta goes often to Acutis\u2019 shrine from the nearby city of Perugia with a group of fellow mothers to pray for their children.",
      "\u201cCarlo Acutis gives us peace,\u201d she said. \u201cMost importantly he gives us the certainty that God is a good father. And you can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d",
      "As she talked outside the sanctuary, a Confirmation group from Lake Garda in northern Italy was praying in a circle by a cutout of Acutis in his jeans and backpack standing by a larger-than-life monstrance.",
      "One of the catechists, Veronica Abraham, said she had been teaching about both St. Francis and Acutis, focusing on the teen\u2019s charity and his custom of sitting down to chat with anyone who looked lonely, \u201csince even a ciao is important for those who are alone.\u201d",
      "Her son Mario Girardi, 13, said he was really struck by the fact that Acutis \u2014 when only a couple of years older than him \u2014 \u201cspoke with everyone, didn\u2019t let anything bother him but helped everyone.\u201d",
      "While he\u2019s not considering the priesthood, Girardi does go to church every Sunday and plans to \u201calways stay in this mindset\u201d \u2014 maybe even going to daily Mass.",
      "Would he want to become a saint, too?",
      "\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope. Yes, right? Never say never, who knows,\u201d the boy said, grinning.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",

      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace.

      "Some European countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because a big unknown is whether Trump would allow U.S. forces and intelligence agencies to back up any European contingent with air and logistical support and other assistance.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 British officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a picture from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",
      "Macron said Wednesday that the proposed European force could deploy to \u201cimportant towns, strategic bases\u201d in Ukraine and that it could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged. But he suggested that a Russian attack might not go unanswered, even though the European troops wouldn't be deployed to the frontlines.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the frontlines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression.",
      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",
      "Russian drone attacks overnight injured at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a frontline community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said the attacks were further evidence that the U.S. and Europe should not ease sanctions on Moscow.",
      "\u201cRussia is killing every day and prolonging this war,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media. \u201cThe American proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table for half a month now.\u201d",

      "There was no word of any immediate progress, but both sides sounded positive on the state of relations.",
      "Barrot met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who said in a news conference afterward that both countries should \u201cchoose multilateralism over unilateralism ... and pursue mutual benefit and win-win outcomes instead of decoupling and isolation.\u201d",
      "That echoed language frequently used by China in criticizing U.S. foreign policy and the Western-led political order.",
      "Barrot later met with Premier Li Qiang, who said: \"As we all know, the world is currently not peaceful, and instability and uncertainty are increasing.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs two independent and responsible major countries, China and France should strengthen cooperation. Through our cooperation, we should inject more certainty into bilateral relations and the world,\u201d Li said.",
      "Barrot responded that the world was \u201cindeed going through troubled times where a number of major principles, particularly those of multilateralism, are being shaken.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this context, a new Europe is rapidly emerging, its only compass being strategic autonomy. This new Europe is investing massively in its defense, in energy,\u201d the minister said before reporters were escorted from the room.",
      "On Friday, Barrot will travel to Shanghai for meetings with local officials and business leaders.",
      "France has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its struggle against Russia's invasion, while Beijing has backed Russia diplomatically and provided an economic lifeline by buying Russian natural resources. Barrot's visit is an opportunity to gauge China's attitude on Ukraine ahead of a major French-hosted meeting on a possible peacekeeping force for the country.",
      "The talks come as fissures are showing between the U.S. and Europe over support for Ukraine, with Washington increasingly seen as backing Moscow.",
      "French President Fran\u00e7ois Macron said Wednesday that a proposed European armed force could be deployed in Ukraine in under an eventual peace deal, and could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Europe has long complained of unfair Chinese trade practices that it says force European companies to take on Chinese partners, share business practices and result in a major Chinese trade surpluses.",
      "The sides also issued a joint statement reaffirming cooperation on climate change marking the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, saying \u201cthe agreement and its long-term goals even more requires all parties to inject political impetus into the international cooperation on jointly fighting climate change (and) protecting biodiversity and ecosystems.\"",
      "China is both the largest producer and consumer of fossil fuels, mainly coal.",
      "The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has started the one-year process to once again pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and, formalizing another withdrawal from both climate and foreign aid programs, the Trump administration has told world financial institutions that the U.S is pulling out of the international climate Loss and Damage Fund.",
      "In its first 50 days, the Trump administration has eliminated or cut funding for environmental justice domestically, foreign aid, climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion.",

      "Hibatullah Akhundzada, who seldom leaves the southern province of Kandahar and is rarely seen in public, urged people to rally behind the country\u2019s security forces whose \u201chard work and dedication\u201d had brought peace to Afghanistan.",

      "Akhundzada\u2019s message was issued in five languages - Arabic, Dari, English, Pashto, and Urdu - and published on the social platform X by the Taliban government\u2019s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid.",
      "Hassan Abbas, a professor at the National Defense University in Washington D.C. and author of the \u201cReturn of the Taliban,\u201d said Akhundzada stressed the importance of unity from a religious perspective by citing verses from the Quran.",

      "Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, there has been a shift of power and decision-making from the capital Kabul to Kandahar, a Taliban heartland and Akhundzada\u2019s base.",
      "The United Nations has said that Kandahar\u2019s return as the seat of power \u2014 as it was during the Taliban\u2019s rule in the 1990s \u2014 circumvented senior Taliban ministers in Kabul because of the way decisions were made.",

      "KARAN, Mali -- A solar power plant in this rural corner of Mali has jolted a village to life and awakened dreams of steady power in other areas of this West African nation as it sees unprecedented growth in renewable energy.",
      "The border village of Karan and its 3,000 people used to go days without electricity. Now, enough power is available around the clock to run small video gaming centers and boost commercial activities.",
      "The electricity comes from a mini-grid of dozens of panels and storage batteries operated by WeLight, a Madagascan rural electrification startup, since 2021.",
      "\u201cBefore the solar power came to the village, I ran my bakery with a generator,\u201d said Samba Diakit\u00e9. Running the diesel-powered generator used to cost $100 a day. He said he now saves more than half of that amount and has a daily income of $124.",
      "But experts say the rest of Mali \u2014 and much of West Africa \u2014 has a long way to go before seeing similar progress. Many rural areas remain without electricity, affecting everything from students' evening homework to business investment.",
      "Only 53% of Mali\u2019s population had access to electricity as of 2021, according to the latest data from the World Bank. In rural areas, access is as low as 25%, according to Abdoulaye Makan Sissoko, an official with Mali\u2019s rural electrification agency.",
      "Studies have shown that achieving universal access to electricity in Mali would require an investment of around $1.3 billion to extend networks and create more mini-grids, Sissoko said.",
      "Solar power is a recent development in the country. The government is encouraging the use of it by exempting equipment from customs duties and promising to subsidize the price of solar kits. Without such subsidies, solar energy in Mali is about twice the price of the traditional fossil fuel energy used in cities.",
      "For now, people pay a subscription ranging from $30 to $164 for a meter and pay about $0.50 per kilowatt.",
      "The rural electrification agency says 32 mini-solar plants like the one in Karan are in four regions in Mali's south and southwest of the country, providing power for more than 2 million people, and are run by WeLight and German-owned Africa GreenTec.",
      "\u201cWe started with 48 connections and now we have more than 200. We had to expand our generation capacity and distribution network to meet demand,\u201d said Brice Bado, WeLight\u2019s sales manager, speaking about Karan.",
      "Mali's government has recognized the need for electricity. This year, it approved raising money from telephone, mobile money and alcohol sales and usage fees to boost electricity production. In March, telephone companies announced a 10% levy on telephone and internet credit top-ups and a 1% levy on mobile money cash withdrawals.",
      "But the country's political crisis has also affected the push to expand electricity access. After two coups, the relationship between the military-run government and some foreign partners deteriorated, leading to the withdrawal of key ones.",
      "Among them was France, which along with the European Union had a $39.5 million rural electrification project called PHARE in a startup phase. It is now cancelled.",
      "There were also rural electrification projects financed by the Islamic Development Bank to electrify 24 villages awarded to French company Sagecom, but the military government ordered the bank to revoke the contracts and reopen the bidding process, according to Sissoko with the rural electrification agency. Now the project is being cancelled, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, the World Bank last year suspended $60 million in financing to support Mali\u2019s state-owned energy company over a dispute with the military government about financing arrangements.",
      "Political instability is one reason why countries in the Sahel \u2014 the arid strip south of the Sahara desert \u2014 have not been able to achieve electrification goals, along with insecurity and poor governance, said Beverly Ochieng, a security analyst with the London-based Control Risks.",
      "Insecurity caused by extremist attacks is another challenge to expansion in Mali, especially in the north, limiting the areas where companies can safely set up solar mini-grids.",
      "\u201cEnergy needs continue to grow at a rate of between 4 to 10%, depending on the countries, and this combination of factors makes the Sahel and Mali a difficult environment to support the development of sustainable projects,\" Ochieng said.",
      "Nonetheless, the solar plant has brought some relief to Karan, one of the villages selected based on data provided by Mali\u2019s rural electrification agency.",
      "Issa Doumbia, wearing goggles as he welded a metal door, recalled how he used to spend $16 to $23 a day on diesel for a generator but now spends $8 thanks to solar power.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not much of a market to make big profits. So, I would like to see the price of electricity go down,\u201d he said.",
      "As night fell, trader Mah Konar\u00e9 spread lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers on a table along the main road. Her business has been extended with the help of the new streetlights.",
      "\u201cBeyond myself, these streetlights bring security to the village,\" she said. \u201cI now feel safe when my father goes to the mosque at night.\u201d",

Healthcare workers are known to perform terminating procedures when the situation is \u201cincompatible with life\u201d of the woman, usually in the case of \u201cincomplete\u201d abortions. Because abortion is illegal, they cite other reasons for the termination.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s President Julius Maada Bio pointedly introduced the Safe Motherhood Bill after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, stripping away women's constitutional protections for abortion.",
      "\u201cAt a time when sexual and reproductive health rights for women are either being overturned or threatened, we are proud that Sierra Leone can once again lead with progressive reforms,\u201d Bio said.",
      "If approved, the bill would have been West Africa's most progressive legislation on abortion, allowing the procedure for up to 14 weeks.",
      "But Sierra Leone since then has been torn apart by debate. Following opposition from religious leaders, the bill has been amended and now limits abortion to cases of life-threatening risk, fatal fetal abnormalities, rape or incest.",
      "The government says it expects a vote in parliament in the coming weeks. It is not clear whether it will be approved.",
      "An estimated 90,000 abortions are performed annually in Sierra Leone, a country of more than 8 million people, according to research by the African Population and Health Research Center. About 10% of the country's maternal deaths \u2014 affecting 717 of every 100,000 births \u2014 are due to unsafe abortions, the center said.",
      "Health workers say the true number is likely much higher.",
      "Due to cost and stigma, many women and girls resort to unsafe methods like expired medication, laundry detergent, hangers or sharp instruments.",
      "On a recent morning at a clinic run by the MSI Sierra Leone nonprofit, dozens of women and girls waited nervously for consultations with nurse Hawanatu Samura.",
      "MSI offers \u201cpost-abortion care,\u201d including terminations in cases of \u201cincomplete\u201d miscarriage, often when people have tried and failed abortions themselves. The nonprofit is the largest individual service provider of family planning services in the country.",
      "If patients want an abortion, \u201cthey go to any length,\u201d Samura said. She often sees damage caused by unsterilized instruments, leading to severe hemorrhages, especially in underage girls.",
      "Over 20% of girls between 15 and 19 in Sierra Leone get pregnant, according to the U.N. Population Fund, one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the world.",
      "Samura said a 13-year-old \u2014 already mother to a 10-month-old \u2014 recently arrived with severe pain after secretly taking unidentified pills to try to abort her pregnancy.",
      "\u201cIn Sierra Leone, people are afraid of the stigma \u2026 so they would prefer to die silently,\u201d she said. The patient did not understand her body, Samura said, and her dead fetus resulted in dangerous septicemia.",
      "The clinic has at least one such case a month, the nurse said.",
      "Many women and girls who have had abortions fear speaking out, and the push for the bill in Sierra Leone has been led by women\u2019s rights groups and medical professionals.",
      "\u201cIf you aren\u2019t listening to your doctors, then who are you listening to?\u201d said lawyer and advocate Nicky Spencer-Coker. She has fought for reproductive rights alongside a coalition of women\u2019s rights organisations since 2015.",
      "At the time, parliament unanimously passed a first version of a bill allowing abortions for up to 12 weeks. But then-President Ernest Bai Koroma blocked the bill amid pressure from anti-abortion and religious groups.",
      "Some Muslim and Christian leaders have denounced the current bill as \u201cungodly\u201d and \u201chellish.\u201d Archbishop Edward Tamba Charles, head of the country's Inter-Religious Council, said it contradicts citizens' \u201creligious values and sensibilities.\u201d",
      "Sierra Leone's current president has faced opposition from his own party members, including lawmaker Rebecca Yei Kamara.",
      "\u201cIn our communities, children don\u2019t get pregnant \u2026 they talk to them, they teach them how to grow up into womanhood,\u201d she said, and accused supporters of the bill of exaggerating the country's abortion statistics.",
      "Government officials have called the bill a necessary response to the reality of high numbers of deaths among pregnant women.",
      "\u201cThe number of girls that die every year \u2026 that\u2019s the demonstration of people\u2019s will,\u201d Chernor Bah, the information minister, told The Associated Press.",
      "Officials also say the bill is needed to strengthen gender reforms in Sierra Leone, which include last year\u2019s ban on child marriage.",
      "The bill also would allow wider access to family planning and reproductive health services. Activists fear those will be lost if the bill fails.",
      "Both sides in the debate have accused each other of being sponsored by foreign governments.",
      "Some conservative U.S. media have framed the bill in Sierra Leone as a \u201cBiden-backed push\u201d for abortion rights in Africa.",
      "The U.S. embassy in Freetown denied involvement in the bill.",
      "Sierra Leone's Inter-Religious Council has cited the recent changes on abortion access in the U.S. as reference points in their position papers opposing the bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the reality for some pregnant women and girls remains harrowing.",
      "Many healthcare practitioners told the AP they want the bill to pass so they can save lives without fear.",
      "Samura the nurse recalled a mother who had traveled for hours in agony to the capital after drinking a concoction given to her by a traditional healer. Samura accompanied the patient to a hospital to seek treatment for a distended abdomen, severe septicemia and anemia.",
      "The mother of six died in the waiting room.",
      "\u201cRight there on the couch \u2026. everybody was crying,\u201d Samura said. \u201cAnytime I think of her, I wish the bill had been long passed.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Officials in the South Korean city of Andong on Tuesday alerted residents to evacuate to safe areas as firefighters struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged southern regions since last week, forcing thousands to flee and destroying likely hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.",
      "Thousands of firefighters in South Korea were battling at least nine wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land in the past five days.",
      "Officials in Andong, a city in the country\u2019s southeast, and the nearby town of Uiseong ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters \u2014 including schools and indoor gyms \u2014 as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread due to strong winds. The fire in Andong was also reaching the village of Pungcheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded around the 14-15th centuries.",
      "The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple\u2019s national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.",
      "The fire was also spreading to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong.",
      "More than 3,700 firefighters, along with 76 helicopters and 530 vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires in the Uiseong and Andong areas, which were nearly 70% contained as of Tuesday evening, according to the Korea Forest Service.",
      "The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest \u201cserious\u201d level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.",
      "South Korean officials said earlier on Tuesday that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in the country\u2019s southern regions, including Uiseong, the neighboring town of Sancheong, and Ulsan city. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks.",
      "Four firefighters and government workers were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds. At least 11 other people have been injured by wildfires around the country since last Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.",
      "The national government designated the hardest-hit southeastern regions as disaster zones to focus resources and accelerate recovery efforts.",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country\u2019s acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. He also urged public vigilance as dry spring weather persists.",
      "Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.",

      "A judge on Tuesday chastised the duo \u2014 both military personnel \u2014 for being the \u201cantithesis\u201d of everything Paddington\u2019s character stands for.",
      "Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22 and engineers in the Royal Air Force, admitted in Reading Magistrates\u2019 Court that they were responsible for the March 2 vandalism in Newbury, the hometown of Paddington creator Michael Bond.",
      "\u201cPaddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike,\u201d Judge Sam Goozee said. \u201cHe represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society. ... Your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for.\u201d",
      "The statue of the bear in his signature blue coat and red hat was one of 23 installed last fall as part of a Paddington trail across England to mark the release of \u201cPaddington in Peru.\u201d The introspective bear is gazing skyward while clutching a sandwich \u2014 with marmalade about to drip on his lap.",
      "The judge noted that the label on Paddington\u2019s coat says, \u201cPlease look after this bear.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor said Jamie Renuka said the men were drunk during the escapade that was captured by a surveillance camera on the empty street just before 2 a.m. The two spirited away half of the statue in a taxi and returned to RAF Odiham base where the purloined Paddington was later found in Lawrence\u2019s car.",
      "Goozee said the crime could \u201conly be described as an act of wanton vandalism\u201d and that the two had failed to uphold the respect and integrity expected in the military.",
      "The pair, who admitted criminal damage, were ordered to perform community work and each to pay 2,725 pounds ($3,527) for repairs to the damaged statue.",
      "An RAF spokesperson said the service would consider the court's findings but that any discipline would not be disclosed because it would be a private matter.",
      "The statue is currently being repaired and will be reinstalled, the Newbury Business Improvement District said.",

      "The defendants included 14 current or former fighters of the elite Azov brigade, which Russia designated a terrorist group, and nine women and one man who worked as cooks or support personnel, according to Russian media reports and rights activists. Twelve defendants were not in court \u2014 11 had returned to Ukraine in two prisoner exchanges and were convicted in absentia.

      "Memorial, a prominent Russian rights group that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, has designated all the defendants as political prisoners. According to Memorial, some of them were captured in 2022 during fighting in the port city of Mariupol, where they held out at the Azovstal steel mill, besieged by Russian troops. Others were detained as they tried to leave the city after it was overrun by Russian forces, the group said.",

      "Greenland and Denmark appear cautiously relieved by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday",
      "Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved early Wednesday by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday, reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.",
      "The couple will now visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance\u2019s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "President Donald Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.",
      "The vice president\u2019s decision to visit a U.S. military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Yet Vance has also criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR Wednesday that the Vances' updated travel plans are a good thing. The minister said the change was a deescalation, even as he said the Americans are treating it as the opposite, with Vance suggesting in an online video that global security is at stake.",
      "Anne Merrild, a professor and Arctic expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders.",
      "Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table.",
      "\u201cIt's a signal to the whole world, it's a strong signal to Denmark, it's a signal to Greenland,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course it's also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we're pursuing.\u201d",
      "Vance is allowed to visit the base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the U.S. regarding the defense of Greenland.",
      "\u201cWhat is controversial here is all about the timing,\u201d he said. \u201cGreenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don\u2019t want the U.S. to visit right now, when Greenland doesn\u2019t have a government in place,\" following the election earlier this month. Coalition negotiations are ongoing.",
      "Ahead of the vice president\u2019s announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday night that it had \u201cnot extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.\u201d",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday that the visit was \u201cunacceptable pressure.\"",
      "Usha Vance's office said Sunday that she would depart Thursday for Greenland and return Saturday. She and one of the couple's three children had planned to visit historic sites and learn about Greenland\u2019s culture, but her husband\u2019s participation has reoriented the trip around national security, her office said.",
      "Vance said leaders in Denmark and North America had \u201cignored\u201d Greenland for \u201cfar too long.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world\u2019s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump\u2019s plans.",
      "Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of the Polar Research & Policy Initiative, said that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cintimidation\u201d of Greenland could backfire.",
      "Menezes said if Trump was \u201csmart enough\u201d to understand Greenland\u2019s strategic importance, then he should also be \u201csmart enough to know there is no greater way to weaken America\u2019s hand and hurt its long-term interests than turning its back on its allies, the principal asymmetrical advantage it enjoys over its adversaries.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has included a desire for territorial expansion, as he seeks to add Canada as a 51st state and resume U.S. control of the Panama Canal. He has also indicated that U.S. interests could take over the land in the war-torn Gaza Strip and convert it into a luxury outpost, displacing up to 2 million Palestinians.",

      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon appointed asset manager Karim Souaid to the post of central bank governor Thursday as the government tries to reform the economy after months of war and decades of mismanagement and corruption.",
      "The country's economy has been in crisis for five years and desperately needs reforms to unlock international aid, and on top of that, Israel\u2019s 14-month war with Hezbollah caused what the World Bank estimates was $11 billion in damages and economic losses.",
      "The appointment was announced by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the International Court of Justice jurist who was named Lebanon\u2019s premier in January following the election of President Joseph Aoun earlier that month.",
      "Salam said that Souaid was chosen by more than two-thirds of the 24 members of Lebanon's reformist Cabinet, though the prime minister said he himself did not support the decision. \u201cThe Lebanese have asked us for reforms and we insist on reforms,\u201d Salam told reporters after the government meeting.",
      "Souaid, an asset manager who previously was a senior executive at HSBC bank, is seen by critics as being sympathetic to the stance on economic reform taken by the country's banks, and fear he might sell what\u2019s left of Lebanon\u2019s state assets to bail them out.",
      "An unproductive economy and decades of corruption by Lebanon\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019. Covid-19, the massive Beirut Port blast in August 2020 and the monthlong Israel-Hezbollah war furthered compounded the country\u2019s economic woes.",
      "Lebanon has been running on a cash economy, with most of its electricity coming from private suppliers, leading to inflation and pulling almost half the population into poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "The country has struggled to reach an International Monetary Fund-approved deal to unlock aid to make the economy viable again, with the international financial institution asking Lebanon to end waste, crack down on corruption and financial crimes, and restructure its banking sector.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s commercial banks have been hesitant to implement some of these reforms, as it would burden them with the country\u2019s tens of billions of dollars in economic losses, experts and activists say. The banks believe the state should carry most of that burden, blaming them for defaulting on paying back the state\u2019s massive debt in 2020 and for its wasteful spending.",
      "Souaid had the backing of President Aoun, while Salam and a handful of ministers have remained skeptical of him.",
      "\u201cKarim Souaid was not my candidate and I abstained with some ministers because of my concerns regarding the rights of depositors,\u201d Salam told reporters after the Cabinet meeting, referring to concerns that large amounts of bank deposits might not be given back to depositors. \u201cHe will have to abide by the financial policy of our reformist Cabinet.\u201d",
      "Souaid succeeds Riad Salameh, the embattled former governor of 30 years whose term ended with several international corruption cases lodged against him and for embezzlement and other financial crimes. Salameh was appointed in 1993, when Lebanon was scrambling to bounce back after a 15-year civil war.",
      "Salameh, who is currently in detention, was heralded as a financial genius for preventing hyperinflation and keeping the Lebanese currency stable through years of political tensions and conflict, and then left his post widely perceived as a key architect of the country\u2019s financial downfall.",

      "Major anti-abortion groups are gathering in the nation's capital to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- Major anti-abortion groups were gathering in the nation's capital on Thursday to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump's administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood ahead of the Supreme Court hearing a case in April that could strip the organization's funding in South Carolina.",
      "The anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider.",
      "\u201cThis event begins an intensive round of outreach to the GOP, calling on them to take advantage of this unique moment to defund the abortion industry,\u201d Students for Life, the national anti-abortion group organizing the event, said in a statement.",
      "The Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization\u2019s 2023 report. Planned Parenthood also provides other forms of reproductive health care, including contraception, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, often for low-income patients.",
      "Vicki Ringer, Planned Parenthood\u2019s South Carolina director of public affairs, said claims that Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding for abortion is \u201can attempt to mislead the public\u201d and emphasized Planned Parenthood\u2019s role in providing broader reproductive health care.",
      "\u201cWe should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,\u201d Ringer said.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University's Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump\u2019s presidential victory and by his fellow Republicans winning control of Congress in November.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,\" she said.",
      "The Supreme Court announced it would hear a case involving South Carolina's attempt to strip Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization's funding.",
      "Almost 100 conservative members of Congress signed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to side with South Carolina. The state already bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "In February, a panel of judges in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling that attempted to force Planned Parenthood to repay millions of dollars of Medicaid funding in Texas and Louisiana.",
      "If the Supreme Court sides with South Carolina, Rebouche said, there may be a wider impact on health care by \"giving states broad power to exclude health care that is unpopular or politically disfavored,\u201d such as contraception. Targeting Planned Parenthood might also have a negative effect on maternal and infant mortality rates and could cost more money in the long run by cutting off low-income patients from vital preventive reproductive health care, she said.",
      "During a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina \u2014 have introduced bills this year aiming to create tax breaks for anti-abortion centers.",
      "The strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict medication abortion access nationwide.",
      "Rather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves after waffling on the issue on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don\u2019t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning assistance. He also pardoned several anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinics and used wording related to fetal personhood in an executive order rolling back protections for transgender people.",
      "The Republican president has appointed abortion opponents in some key Cabinet positions that could affect the availability of medication abortion and contraception, Medicaid coverage for family planning services, collection of abortion-related data and abortion access for troops and veterans.",
      "Advocates on either side of the abortion debate are waiting to see if Trump's Department of Justice will revive the Comstock Act, a 19th-century obscenity law, to restrict the mailing of medication abortion or other materials used for abortions. Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of defending abortion restrictions, and her confirmation was celebrated by abortion opponents.",

      "Many automakers have been preparing for tariffs to impact their operations since Trump first announced plans to impose the taxes earlier this year. General Motors and others have worked to get more inventory into the U.S. ahead of any tariffs.",

      "The rate fell to 6.65% from 6.67% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.79%.",
      "This is the first decline in the average rate after rising two weeks in a row. The average rate has been mostly trending lower since mid-January, when it climbed to just over 7% \u2014 a welcome trend for aspiring homebuyers struggling to afford a home after years of soaring home prices.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, rose this week, however, pushing the average rate to 5.89% from 5.83% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.11%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions.",
      "The overall decline this year in the average rate on a 30-year mortgage loosely follows the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was nearing 4.8% in mid-January, has mostly fallen since then, reflecting rising unease over the Trump administration\u2019s escalating tariffs on imported goods, which economists warn could drive inflation higher, hurting economic growth. The yield was at 4.37% in midday trading Thursday.",
      "Bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated, so if inflation ticks upward that could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates.",
      "For now, the economic uncertainty is helping lower mortgage rates, just as the spring homebuying season ramps up.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "Easing mortgage rates and more homes on the market nationally helped drive home sales higher in February from the previous month, though they were down year-over-year.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",
      "But the conflict is raging on.",
      "Before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace, Russian drone attacks overnight wounded more than 20 people and heavy shelling Thursday afternoon killed one person and knocked out electricity in parts of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and last week to halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead.",

      "Some European countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because a big unknown is whether Trump would allow American forces and intelligence agencies to back up any European contingent with air and logistical support and other assistance.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said that military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted an image from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the front lines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "The meeting in Paris came as Russia has demanded lifting sanctions to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire.",
      "Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe have punished Russia\u2019s economy and limited its access to global markets.",
      "Zelenskyy accused Moscow of attempting to add conditions to what should be an unconditional agreement.",
      "While the White House said that it would help restore Russia\u2019s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, it didn\u2019t validate Moscow\u2019s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Russia\u2019s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump.",

      "\u201cThis means keeping up the pressure on Russia through sanctions,\u201d Costa said Thursday.",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily.

      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",

      "Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn\u2019t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Albertsons said it was Kroger that failed to honor the merger agreement.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s self-interested conduct doomed the merger, and we are now focused on returning value to Albertsons\u2019 shareholders to compensate for those losses,\u201d Albertsons said.",
      "Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart and Costco.",
      "But the Federal Trade Commission and two states \u2014 Washington and Colorado \u2014 sued to block the merger last year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers\u2019 wages by eliminating competition. It also said Kroger and Albertsons' plan to divest 579 stores C&S Wholesalers was inadequate to ensure competition, since C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.",
      "In December, judges in Washington and Oregon halted the merger in two rulings issued within hours of each other.",
      "Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.",
      "But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",

      "Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.",
      "But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. A recent study released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.",
      "The amount of these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.",
      "\u201cThey are very widespread,\u201d said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they're not in all biosolids and sometimes it's only in small amounts, he added.",
      "Here's how they're made:",
      "At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.",
      "After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.",
      "The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.",
      "The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.",
      "After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for land-applied biosolids.",
      "\u201cThere are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,\u201d including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.",
      "Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.",
      "The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what\u2019s in the water. In addition to human waste, biosolids might contain all kinds of everyday household chemicals like beauty products and pharmaceuticals, some of which may contain forever chemicals, Prasse added. At the Columbus facility, the majority of their waste comes from households and businesses.",
      "The Columbus facility tests the final product for metals and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen every month even when they are being stored before land application.",
      "In Columbus, the city takes half of these dirt-like biosolids to a composting facility nearby, where they are mixed with other organic material like trees and leaves and turned into compost after an additional round of heating and aeration to further kill off pathogens. These biosolids are less regulated and can be used on land such as parks or a residential yard.",
      "The Columbus facility, like most such operations, doesn't test the incoming material for PFAS, an expensive proposition. Dixon said any future testing or treatment of wastewater for PFAS at his facility would depend on future federal regulations.",

      "Someone should have spotted the alarming number of near misses in the skies over the nation's capital before the fatal midair collision that killed 67 people in January, and reviewing the data now could prevent future crashes, according to the head of the agency investigating the crash.",
      "National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy emphasized to Congress Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration had data going back to 2011 showing that collision alarms were sounding inside cockpits at least once a month because of how close the planes were getting to helicopters. But the FAA didn't act, she said.",
      "\u201cAll this data is being collected by FAA from operators, from others, from voluntary reporting systems. Where is that data going to trend potential accidents and incidents in the future?\u201d Homendy said during a hearing on her agency's budget. \u201cThe next accident is in the data right now. And what are we doing to figure out what that is?\u201d",
      "The Senate is planning another hearing Thursday to delve deeper into what the NTSB has found so far about the Jan. 29 midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., Ronald Reagan National Airport. Homendy and the leaders of the FAA and Army's aviation division will all testify.",
      "Both Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month when NTSB first disclosed the shocking statistics that they were angry that the FAA didn't recognize the dangers before this crash after 85 near misses in the past three years when aircraft flew within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other.",
      "The FAA promptly launched a review of all its data after the NTSB briefing to try to identify any similar safety threats, particularly in eight cities with heavy helicopter traffic. The FAA said Wednesday that analysis continues.",
      "That review \u2014 aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 is focused on airports in Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles and the heavy helicopter traffic off the Gulf Coast. The FAA hasn't said whether it has found anything yet, but the agency promised it \u201cwill have corrective action plans for any risks that are identified.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, the FAA quickly adopted the NTSB's recommendation to permanently close off a particular helicopter route near Reagan anytime planes are taking off or landing on the airport's runway 33 that the jetliner was approaching in January when the collision happened. If a helicopter does need to use that route for an urgent reason, no planes will be allowed to take off or land. That should ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace near the airport, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe FAA will continue to closely support the NTSB-led investigation and take action as necessary to ensure public safety,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Homendy declined Wednesday to address President Donald Trump's comments right after the crash suggesting that diversity and inclusion policies at the FAA may have contributed to it because the NTSB investigation isn't complete. A final report identifying the cause isn't expected for more than year. Trump also faulted the helicopter for flying too high and later suggested that an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system was the problem.",
      "New Jersey Democrat Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said it is important to refute those diversity comments now because nothing has been found so far to support them, and she doesn't want the public to get the idea that diversity is the problem.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, loyalty and sycophants seems to be the order of the day, and it\u2019s definitely negatively impacting this federal government doing its job,\u201d Watson Coleman said during the hearing.",
      "Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports.",
      "The NTSB previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers.

      "Delaware lawmakers are putting aside protests from big investors and approving fast-tracked legislation that backers say will protect its status as the world's corporate capital",
      "Delaware lawmakers put aside protests from major investors and approved fast-tracked legislation Tuesday night that backers say will protect its status as the corporate capital of the world after criticism by billionaire Elon Musk and other influential business titans rattled public officials.",
      "The bill is headed to Gov. Matt Meyer, a Democrat who met with corporate leaders about their concerns about precedent-setting court decisions governing corporate conflicts of interest and urged lawmakers to quickly pass changes to the law.",
      "They did, sending the bill through both chambers within two weeks of its introduction, despite shareholders\u2019 lawyers, consumer groups and pension funds slamming it as a giveaway to billionaires and corporate insiders. The House approved it Tuesday night, 32-7, after a unanimous Senate earlier in March.",
      "Delaware\u2019s experienced corporate law courts and their well-developed body of corporate case law have become the go-to destination to settle all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "The state also reaps billions of dollars from the activity, making lawmakers nervous that corporations could flee Delaware and undercut a major source of revenue that funds one-third of Delaware's operating budget.",
      "After two hours of debate Tuesday, Rep. Krista Griffith told colleagues that the bill was complex, but the reasons for voting for it were simple: \u201cProtect Delaware\u2019s economy, protect future opportunities for the people in our state. We have the best business court in the nation.\u201d",
      "However, an opponent, Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton \u2014 referring to the business courts as Delaware's \u201cgolden goose\u201d \u2014 warned that the changes being passed could end up \"cooking that golden goose.\u201d",
      "A legal challenge is widely expected after Meyer signs the bill.",
      "In hearings, lawmakers were warned by corporate lawyers and state officials that businesses were contemplating moving their legal home \u2014 a \u201cDexit,\u201d as it has been dubbed \u2014 and that startups are being advised to incorporate elsewhere, such as competitors Nevada or Texas.",
      "Corporate leaders complained about a lack of predictability, clarity and fairness, lawmakers were told.",
      "Last year, Musk slammed Delaware, saying \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware\u201d and instead recommended Nevada or Texas as destinations after a Delaware judge invalidated his landmark compensation package from Tesla worth potentially more than $55 billion.",
      "Musk and Tesla are appealing in the state Supreme Court, and Musk\u2019s companies \u2014 Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink \u2014 all departed Delaware for Nevada or Texas.",
      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta \u2014 run by billionaire chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 didn\u2019t confirm the report.",
      "The bill has come under withering criticism that it will tilt the playing field decisively against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers, and make it harder for them to hold billionaires and corporate insiders accountable for violating their fiduciary duty.",
      "In a statement, the Consumer Federation of America said Delaware's lawmakers \u201cclearly failed to protect investors with the passage of the Billionaire\u2019s Bill.\u201d",
      "Opponents argue that the bill overturns decades of court precedents. But its backers say it is only affecting newer precedents, modernizing the law, clarifying gray areas and maintaining balance between corporate officers and shareholders.",
      "The bill changes several provisions.",
      "One, it gives corporate officers and controlling stockholders more protections in certain conflict-of-interest cases in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",
      "Institutional investors warn that such a law may prompt them to push corporations that they own to incorporate elsewhere.",

      "The news came as President Donald Trump planned to announce tariffs on auto imports at the White House. Hyundai will be spared from those tariffs on its U.S.-made vehicles. Trump praised the South Korean automaker on Monday, saying its American investments are \u201ca clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work.\u201d",

      "The plant that sprawls across 3,000 acres churns out a finished vehicle about once a minute. Its 1,200 workers are currently producing two electric SUV models \u2014 the Ioniq 5 and the larger Ioniq 9.",
      "The newly announced Georgia expansion is part of $21 billion in U.S. investments over the next three years that Hyundai announced at the White House with Trump on Monday.

      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is supporting the conservative candidate in the race to fill a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which could ultimately decide a Tesla lawsuit",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Tesla CEO Elon Musk and political groups he backs are pouring millions of dollars into the race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court as the electric vehicle company sues to overturn a state law that prevents it from opening dealerships \u2014 a case that eventually could make its way to the high court.",
      "Tesla's multiple attempts to open its own dealerships in Wisconsin keep running up against a state law that allows only third parties, not auto manufacturers, to operate them. The company filed a lawsuit in January seeking an exemption, just as two Musk-backed political action committees started supporting the Republican-backed candidate, Brad Schimel, over his opponent, Susan Crawford, who is supported by Democrats.",
      "Musk, who is the world's wealthiest person and is running President Donald Trump's initiative to slash the size of the federal workforce, has given $3 million to the Wisconsin GOP while groups he supports have funneled more than $17 million into the race. The contributions are part of an extraordinary spending spree in the race, making it by far the most expensive judicial race on record in the U.S. Total spending has eclipsed $80 million with days still to go before the final day of voting on April 1.",
      "Schimel's critics have accused Musk of trying to buy a favorable ruling for Tesla should the dealership case make it to the state Supreme Court. Here are details of the law and Musk's lawsuit:",
      "State statutes generally prohibit vehicle manufacturers from owning or operating dealerships in Wisconsin and give that franchise to third parties. The law was intended to prevent manufacturers from undercutting independent dealerships.",
      "Nearly 20 states have similar prohibitions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The laws took hold in the 1930s as carmakers started to rely on independent dealerships to sell and service vehicles so they could focus on production. Later, independent dealers wanted to prevent manufacturers from opening their own dealerships and driving them out of business.",
      "Tesla sells its vehicles directly to consumers, who can have their vehicles shipped directly to them or to dealerships in 27 states. Because the company can't set up its own dealerships in Wisconsin, buyers there must have the cars delivered to them or travel to dealerships in neighboring Minnesota or Illinois to pick them up.",
      "Tesla officials have been working for almost a decade to secure an exemption from the law. Republican legislators introduced bills in 2017 and 2021 that would permit Tesla dealerships, but none of those made it out of the Legislature. They inserted an exemption for Tesla dealerships into the 2019-21 state budget, but Democratic Gov. Tony Evers used his partial veto powers to erase the provision.",
      "The Wisconsin Automobile and Truck Dealers Association has been fighting to preserve the law. Bill Sepic, the association's president and CEO, told The Associated Press that Tesla should have to follow the law like any other vehicle manufacturer. He said the statutes exist to enable third parties to act as consumer advocates \u201cin making one of the larger purchases of their life.\u201d",
      "Tesla filed a lawsuit in state court in January seeking permission to open four dealerships in Wisconsin.",
      "The company argues that independent dealers wouldn't meet its standards and says selling vehicles at its own dealerships is in the public interest because unaffiliated dealers' prices are higher and less transparent.",
      "Its lawsuit says that the state law barring manufacturers from running their own dealerships violates economic liberty rights and that the prohibition exists only to protect independent dealers from competition.",
      "The case is pending in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, though no hearings have been scheduled.",
      "The state Justice Department is defending the law. An agency spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Schimel, the conservative state Supreme Court candidate, is vying with Crawford for an open seat on the high court.",
      "The race is the most significant election nationally since the November presidential contest, providing an early barometer for Republicans and Democrats given the intense interest and outside spending it has generated. It also will determine whether the highest court in the perennial presidential battleground state will flip from liberal to conservative control with major cases involving abortion, union rights and congressional redistricting on the horizon.",
      "Eight days after Tesla filed the Wisconsin dealership lawsuit, Musk tweeted: \u201cVery important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\u201d",
      "To be clear, there has been no evidence of widespread voting fraud in Wisconsin. Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the state over then-President Donald Trump in 2020 was affirmed by a recount and an independent audit. Trump, a Republican, won the state last November and offered no objections then to the voting or ballot-counting.",
      "According to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice, Musk-backed groups America PAC and Building America's Future have spent more than $17 million to support Schimel with ads and flyers. The money he donated to the state Republican Party has been used to help Schimel, who has been endorsed by Trump.",
      "Crawford's supporters contend the timing of the contributions show Musk is trying to ensure that Schimel wins and creates a conservative majority on the court that ultimately would rule in Tesla's favor. Crawford said during a debate with Schimel this month that Musk \u201chas basically taken over Brad Schimel's campaign.\u201d",
      "Sepic, president of the state dealership association, said Wisconsin should elect the candidate who enforces the prohibition but declined to comment when asked if he thought Schimel or Crawford would do that.",
      "Schimel has repeatedly said he would treat any case involving Tesla the same as any other when he considers whether to hear it or recuse himself. Schimel also has insisted that the donations from Musk and his groups do not make him beholden to them.",
      "Crawford has said the same thing about billionaires who have donated to her campaign, including George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Soros has contributed $2 million and Pritzker $1.5 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, which has funneled the money to Crawford\u2019s campaign.",

      "The chief-executive-to-be at money-losing Japanese automaker Nissan is determined to speed up the company's decision-making to come up with models that say Nissan _ and really sell",
      "ATSUGI, Japan -- The chief-executive-to-be at money-losing Japanese automaker Nissan is determined to speed up decision-making to come up with models that say Nissan \u2014 and really sell.",
      "Ivan Espinosa, 46, chief planning officer and a Mexican with two decades of experience at Nissan Motor Corp., told reporters in embargoed comments for Wednesday that the company's corporate culture is \u201clacking empathy\u201d and has to change.",
      "\u201cWe need to work together as one single team,\u201d he said at the Nissan Technical Center in Atsugi city on the outskirts of Tokyo. \u201cWe need to work together hand in hand.\u201d",
      "Nissan recently appointed Espinosa to take its helm, effective April 1, replacing Makoto Uchida.",
      "Espinosa has his work cut out for him as the maker of the Sentra sedan and Infiniti luxury cars faces yet another crisis, which began decades ago when Carlos Ghosn was sent in by French alliance partner Renault to save it from the brink of bankruptcy.",
      "Ghosn was arrested by Japanese authorities in 2018 on financial misconduct allegations but jumped bail and is now in Lebanon.",
      "Uchida, chief since 2019 when Ghosn\u2019s successor Hiroto Saikawa resigned over a separate money scandal, stepped down after the company projected a loss for the fiscal year through March.",
      "Espinosa expressed an openness to partnerships, including with parties outside the auto industry, although he declined to give specifics.",
      "Nissan recently ditched talks with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. to set up a joint holding company. They will continue to cooperate on technology development.",
      "Espinosa repeatedly came back to the importance of being nimble. New cars will be developed in 37 months, and offshoot models within 30 months, he said.",
      "Auto production, starting with design and culminating in product tests, takes several years. Bringing a product to market in 30 months would be relatively quick for the industry.",
      "To showcase its turnaround plans, Nissan showed an array of models rolling out in the next two years for the U.S., Europe, Japan and other markets, some of them as mockup models.",
      "Espinosa and other officials promised a lineup that highlights Nissan\u2019s legacy, like the Leaf electric car, and models that sell in greater volumes. It\u2019s also bringing out various ecological models, like hybrids, plug-ins and electric vehicles, and cutting-edge technology like self-driving cars.",
      "When announcing his replacement, Uchida called Espinosa \u201ca car guy.\u201d",
      "Espinosa, who drives a Z sportscar, Nissan\u2019s flagship nameplate, said he saw himself as \u201ca car lover.\u201d He loves the stories behind each car, he said, like how it\u2019s developed and becomes loved by customers.",
      "Analysts have so far taken a cautious approach to Espinosa\u2019s appointment. As an insider, he takes up where Uchida left off, meaning the verdict is still out.",
      "\u201cWe view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy, once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d CreditSights analysts Todd Duvick and Will Lee wrote in a recent commentary.",

      "Since the 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, communities across Hawaii have sought ways to protect themselves from more destructive fires wrought by decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies",
      "KULA, Hawaii -- The car tires, propane tanks, gas generators and rusty appliances heaped on the side of a dirt road waiting to be hauled away filled Desiree Graham with relief.",
      "\u201cThat means all that stuff is not in people\u2019s yards,\" she said on a blustery July day in Kahikinui, a remote Native Hawaiian homestead community in southeast Maui where wildfire is a top concern.",
      "In June, neighbors and volunteers spent four weekends clearing rubbish from their properties in a community-wide effort to create \u201cdefensible space,\u201d or areas around homes free of ignitable vegetation and debris. They purged 12 tons of waste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ugly, but it\u2019s pretty beautiful to me,\u201d said Graham, a member of Kahikinui's Firewise committee, part of a rapidly growing program from the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association that helps residents assess their communities' fire risk and create plans to mitigate it.",
      "Kahikinui is one of dozens of Hawaii communities seeking ways to protect themselves as decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies culminate to cause more destructive fires.",
      "The state has 250,000 acres of unmanaged fallow agricultural land, nearly all of its buildings sit within the wildland-urban interface, and two-thirds of communities have only one road in and out.",
      "But experts say that even with so many factors out of communities\u2019 control, they can vastly improve their resilience \u2014 by transforming their own neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFire is not like other natural hazards, it can only move where there is fuel, and we have a lot of say in that,\u201d said Nani Barretto, co-executive director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization (HWMO), a 25-year-old nonprofit at the forefront of the state\u2019s fire-risk mitigation.",
      "Neighborhoods all over the United States are wrestling with the same challenge, some in places that never worried about fire before. A recent Headwaters Economics analysis found 1,100 communities in 32 states shared similar risk profiles to places recently devastated by urban wildfires.",
      "HWMO helps communities like Kahikinui become Firewise. In the 10 years preceding the August 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, 15 Hawaii communities joined Firewise USA. Since then, the number has more than doubled to 31, with a dozen more in the process of joining.",
      "\u201cEveryone was like, \u2019My God, what can we do?'\u201d said Shelly Aina, former chair of the Firewise committee for Waikoloa Village, an 8,000-resident community on the west side of the Big Island, recalling the months after the Maui fires.",
      "The development \u2014 heavily wind exposed, surrounded by dry invasive grasses and with just one main road in and out \u2014 had already experienced several close calls in the last two decades. It was first recognized as Firewise in 2016.",
      "As HWMO-trained home assessors, Shelly and her husband Dana Aina have done over 60 free assessments for neighbors since 2022, evaluating their properties for ignition vulnerabilities. Volunteers removed kiawe trees last year along a fuel break bordering houses. Residents approved an extra HOA fee for vegetation removal on interior lots.",
      "Measures like these can have outsized impact as people in fire-prone states adapt to more extreme wildfires, according to Dr. Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service scientist.",
      "\u201cThe solution is in the community, not out there with the fire breaks, because those don\u2019t stop the fire in extreme conditions,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Direct flames from a wildfire aren\u2019t what typically initiate an urban conflagration, he said. Wind-blown embers can travel miles away from a fire, landing on combustible material like dry vegetation, or accumulating in corners like where a deck meets siding.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re urban fires, not wildfires,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "The solutions don't always require expensive retrofits like a whole new roof, but targeting the specific places within 100 feet of the house where embers could ignite material. In dense neighborhoods, that requires residents work together, making community-wide efforts like Firewise important. \u201cThe house is only as ignition resistant as its neighbors,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Even with renewed interest in fire resilience, community leaders face challenges in mobilizing their neighbors. Mitigation can take money, time and sacrifice. It\u2019s not enough to cut the grass once, for example, vegetation has to be regularly maintained. Complacency sets in. Measures like removing hazardous trees can cost thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we deal with that, because those who have them can\u2019t afford to take them down,\u201d said Shelly Aina. The Ainas try offering low-cost measures, like installing metal screening behind vents and crawl spaces to keep out embers.",
      "HWMO helps with costs where it can. It gave Kahikinui a $5,000 grant for a dumpster service to haul out its waste, and helped Waikoloa Village rent a chipper for the trees it removed. It\u2019s been hard to keep up with the need, said Barretto, but even just a little bit of financial assistance can have an exponential impact.",
      "\u201cYou give them money, they rally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can give them $1,000 and it turns into 1,000 man hours of doing the clearing.\u201d HWMO was able to expand its grant program after the Maui fires with donations from organizations like the Bezos Earth Fund and the American Red Cross.",
      "At a time when federal funding for climate mitigation is uncertain, communities need far more financial support to transform their neighborhoods, said Headwaters Economics' Kimi Barrett, who studies the costs of increasing fire risk. \u201cIf what we\u2019re trying to do is save people and communities, then we must significantly invest in people and communities,\u201d said Barrett.",
      "Those investments are just a fraction of the billions of dollars in losses sustained after megafires, said Barrett. A recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Allstate found that $1 in resilience and preparation investment can save $13 in economic and property losses after a disaster.",
      "Another hurdle is asking residents to do work and make sacrifices as they watch others neglect their role. \u201cThe neighbors will ask, \u2018What about the county land?' There\u2019s no routine maintenance,\u2019\u201d said Shelly Aina.",
      "Her husband Dana Aina said he reminds people that it is everyone\u2019s kuleana, or responsibility, to take care of land and people. \u201cAn island is a canoe, a canoe is an island,\u201d he said, quoting a Hawaiian proverb. \u201cWe all have to paddle together.\u201d",
      "Bigger stakeholders are starting to make changes. Among them, Hawaii passed legislation to create a state fire marshal post, and its main utility, Hawaiian Electric, is undergrounding some power lines and installing AI-enabled cameras to detect ignitions earlier.",
      "Meanwhile, Firewise communities have found that doing their own mitigation gives them more clout when asking for funding or for others to do their part.",
      "After the 66-residence community of Kawaihae Village on Hawaii Island joined Firewise, they were finally able to get a neighboring private landowner and the state to create fuel breaks and clear grasses.",
      "\u201cWithout that we wouldn\u2019t have been on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d said Brenda DuFresne, committee member of Kawaihae Firewise. \u201cI think Firewise is a way to show people that you\u2019re willing to help yourself.\u201d",

      "The Black creators of some consumers products are rethinking their business plans as major U.S. companies end or water down their diversity, equity and inclusion programs",
      "NEW YORK -- The co-founders of a company that makes lip products for darker skin tones no longer hope to get their line into Target. A brother and sister who make jigsaw puzzles celebrating Black subjects wonder if they need to offer \u201cneutral\u201d images like landscapes to keep growing.",
      "Pound Cake and Puzzles of Color are among the small businesses whose owners are rethinking their plans as major U.S. companies weaken their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The initiatives mostly date from the end President Donald Trump\u2019s first term and entered a new era with the dawn of his second one.",
      "Some Black-owned brands suspect big retail chains will drop partnerships they pursued after the police killing of a Black man in 2020 reignited mass protests against racial injustice. In today's anti-DEI climate, other entrepreneurs worry about personal repercussions or feel pressure to cancel contracts with retreating retailers.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a question of, are the big box stores going to be there? Do we even make any attempt to talk to these people?\" Ericka Chambers, one of the siblings behind Puzzles of Color, said. \u201cWe are really having to evaluate our strategy in how we expand and how we want to get in front of new customers.\u201d",
      "Chambers and her brother, William Jones, started turning the work of artists of color into frameable puzzles the same year a video captured a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck. Amid the Black Lives Matter protests over Floyd's death, a fashion designer challenged large retailers to devote 15% of their shelf space and purchasing power to Black businesses.",
      "The Fifteen Percent Pledge helped bring Puzzles of Color's creations to Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom\u2019s websites in 2022. Last year, they made it into select Barnes & Noble stores. Chambers said she's confident in the companies' commitments but recalled a backlash after news outlets covered the brand, which is based in Texas.",
      "\u201cIt does make us think about how we envision ourselves as far as the safety of not wanting to be attacked, because some people are very vocal about being anti-DEI,\u201d Chambers said.",
      "Vibrant depictions of Black women account for many of her and Jones' puzzles. The pair figured they needed to provide more abstract designs for certain Barnes & Noble locations to give Puzzles of Color \u201ca little bit of a fighting chance.\u201d",
      "The first prominent names in U.S. retail to end or retool their diversity programs surfaced last summer amid threats of legal challenges and negative publicity from DEI critics, who argue that setting hiring, promotion and supplier diversity goals for underrepresented groups constitutes reverse discrimination.",
      "After Trump won a second term in November, Walmart joined the corporate pullback. Target's suspension of its comparable DEI targets in January stung Black and LGBTQ+ customers harder, largely because they regarded the Minneapolis-based company as more of a natural ally.",
      "The company said it would continue working with a diverse range of businesses. Philadelphia-based Pound Cake's co-founders, Camille Belle and Johnny Velazquez, said they don't think they would agree at this point if the retailer offered to stock their lipsticks and lip oils.",
      "\u201cTarget would have been a great boost to our business\u2019s growth,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just find it elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Target's stance has created a dilemma for brand founders with existing distribution deals. One is Play Pits, a natural deodorant for children that Maryland resident Chantel Powell launched in 2021. The product is found in about 360 Target stores.",
      "The retailer's DEI program \u201callowed us to employ amazing people, give back to our community, and exhibit Black excellence on and off the shelves,\u201d Powell wrote on LinkedIn as civil rights leaders talked about boycotting Target.",
      "She and some other product creators highlighted the impact boycotts might have on their businesses. They urged upset customers to intentionally limit their purchases to items from Black-owned enterprises. Some activists understood; others pushed the brands to join the protest by cutting ties with Target.",
      "\u201cThe conversation around Black brands, that they should pull out of the retailers that they\u2019re in, is unrealistic,\u201d Powell said this month as a 40-day, church-organized Target boycott was underway. \u201cWe signed up to be in business. I understand why people are having that conversation of boycotts. As a Black founder, I also understand the side of how it can be detrimental.\u201d",
      "The owner of a Black-owned sexual wellness business with its own line of condoms has a slightly different take. Target started carrying B Condoms in 2020, and founder Jason Panda said the company told him late last year that it didn't intend to keep the prophylactics in the 304 stores that stocked them.",
      "Panda says he isn't worried. The product is available through Amazon and in more than 7,000 CVS stores, he said. What's more, contracts with non-profit organizations and local governments that distribute condoms for free are the cornerstone of the business he established in 2011, Panda said.",
      "\u201cMy money has never really come from mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're going to be protected as long as I can maintain my relationship with my community.\u201d",
      "Brianna Arps, who founded the fragrance brand Moodeaux in 2021, notices fewer grants available to Black brand creators these days. She used to apply for 10 to 15 every week or two; the number is down to five to seven, Arps said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the organizations that had been really vocal about supporting (Black businesses) have either quietly or outwardly pulled back,\u201d she said.",
      "Moodeaux was the first Black-owned perfume brand to get its perfumes into Urban Outfitters and Credo Beauty, which specializes in natural vegan products. In the current environment, Arps is looking to expand her brand's presence independent shops and to support other Black fragrance lovers.",
      "\u201cThe resiliency of brands like ours and founders like myself will still exist,\u201d she said.",
      "Aurora James, the founder of the Fifteen Percent Pledge, said nearly 30 major companies that joined the initiative remain committed to it, including Bloomingdale's, beauty retailer Sephora, J. Crew and Gap.",
      "Ulta Beauty, another pledge signatory, and Credo Beauty carry Pound Cake products. Velazquez and Belle want to use social media to direct their followers to support retailers like Ulta and to bolster their online sales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fostering the community that we have and growing that,\u201d Velazquez said.",
      "While making a strategic decision \u201cto appeal to a broader audience\u201d when selecting puzzles for Barnes & Noble, Chambers said she plans to introduce Black faces and experiences to the chain's bookstores over time, in boxes of 500, 750 and 1,000 pieces.",
      "In the meantime, Puzzles of Color expanded its \u201cPride\u201d collection as a response to the DEI backlash. The subjects include Harriet Tubman, a mother and daughter tending a garden, and a little girl in a beauty supply store gazing up at hair accessories.",
      "\u201cDo we lean in all the way?\" Chambers asks herself. \"Part of why we started this was because we didn\u2019t see enough Black people in puzzles.\u201d",

      "WADA eventually provided it, and the AP obtained a copy of Saugy\u2019s 11-page memo. It details the painstaking lengths he took to see if Valieva\u2019s contamination claim was plausible.",
      "Valieva, now 18, was the headliner on the team that finished first in the Olympic team figure skating event at the 2022 Beijing Games but ended up with the bronze medal after her result was scrubbed because of the doping positive. Her suspension ends late in 2025 and reports are that she will return to competition in time for next year's Milan-Cortina Olympics.",
      "In a filing this week to the court, Valieva\u2019s attorneys write: \u201cThe production of Professor Saugy\u2019s report by (WADA) confirms the procedural fraud that motivated the request for review.\u201d",
      "They claim WADA did not disclose the experiment to CAS, which would have added a theory for Valieva\u2019s positive test for scant traces of the drug and also subjected Saugy to cross-examination at the hearing, and when they finally did hand it over, it had been altered to look less favorable for Valieva.",
      "WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said \u201cany allegation of wrongdoing on WADA\u2019s part is completely rejected\u201d and that the agency would \u201cvigorously defend its position in this matter.\u201d",
      "He said the report \"was not WADA\u2019s document to share\u201d and wouldn\u2019t have been covered by discovery obligations.",
      "\u201cThe report was not helpful to Ms. Valieva\u2019s case and, anyway, would have had no impact on the result as the Court of Arbitration for Sport Panel ultimately rejected the athlete\u2019s strawberry dessert explanation, not based on the scientific plausibility but rather because it was not supported by sufficient factual evidence,\u201d Fitzgerald said.",
      "In contamination cases such as the one that ruined the then 15-year-old\u2019s 2022 Olympics and painted her as the helpless pawn of powerful Russian coaches and sports leaders, the athlete has the burden of proving how the drug got into their system.",
      "CAS arbitrators labeled as \u201cinherently implausible\u201d the idea that Valieva would have taken the smoothie her grandpa made on a long train ride and eaten it over a period of days.",
      "Saugy did not respond to AP\u2019s request for an interview.",
      "In the experiment, the scientist tried to replicate conditions under which the grandfather said he made the smoothie by crushing pills on a wooden cutting board that had not been cleaned.",
      "Saugy made estimates on how much residue from the pills, combined with its mingling with the fruit on the same cutting board, could have ended up in the smoothie Valieva claimed she drank on a train from Moscow to St. Petersburg, where she went to compete in December 2021.",
      "\u201cDepending on the quantity and the time of ingestion of this contaminated food by the athlete, the scenario cannot be excluded,\u201d Saugy wrote of the theory that Valieva could have accidentally ingested the drug.",
      "Saugy also included that finding in his conclusion at the end of the report. But further down in that four-paragraph section, he wrote that \u201cthe voluntary intake of a dose of Trimetazidine 4 to 5 days before the antidoping test stays the most plausible scenario.\u201d",
      "In arguing the report was altered, Valieva's attorneys say Saugy\u2019s experiment \u2014 which included breakdowns of how the drug metabolizes in a person's system \u2014 did not support the theory that the scant amount of the drug in Valieva's system at the time of her positive test could have resulted from intentional use of the drug.",
      "\u201cThis additional conclusion, which is unrelated to the purpose of the expert appraisal and the questions posed, contradicts the rest of the report,\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "They also point out that the original request, sent by a WADA deputy director at RUSADA\u2019s request, contains eight questions, while the report only includes Saugy's answers to the first seven. The excluded question: \u201cHow did the TMZ enter the athlete's body?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seems clear that Professor Saugy initially answered this question and subsequently deleted his comments precisely because they were 'super favorable' to Kamila Valieva,\u201d the attorneys argue, in repeating the phrasing used by WADA's director general when he expressed alarm over the experiment.",
      "The drug Valieva tested positive for, Trimetazidine, is the same one that showed up in the systems of 23 Chinese swimmers who were not penalized after WADA accepted that country\u2019s contamination explanation for their positive tests.",
      "That case brought harsh scrutiny on WADA \u2014 the U.S. government stopped paying its dues to the drug-fighting organization \u2014 and the Valieva case illustrates a disconnect between how WADA handled scenarios involving different countries whose athletes tested positive for the same drug and made similar contamination claims.",
      "Valieva\u2019s case was the latest chapter in a saga that, at the time, had dragged on for eight years. Russian sports leaders had been found to be cheating the system at the highest levels, and also lying to WADA when it came asking for evidence of the malfeasance.",
      "Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency was non-compliant at the time the Valieva case played out, which forced it to run the request for Saugy\u2019s experiment through WADA.",
      "WADA, therefore, received the results of the test, and that alarmed director general Olivier Niggli, whose texts to Gunther Younger, the head of the agency\u2019s new intelligence and investigations unit, were seen by the AP.",
      "\u201cIf it is a RUSADA opinion, we should absolutely not be involved in anyway,\u201d Niggli wrote. \u201cThis is a big issue on our side to get involved in such an opinion that will be used in court. We have to stop that urgently.\u201d",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

    "story": [
      "Red Bull has dropped Liam Lawson as the teammate of Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen just two rounds into the season and replaced him with Yuki Tsunoda",
      "Red Bull dropped Liam Lawson as the teammate of Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen after just two rounds of the season and replaced him with Yuki Tsunoda on Thursday.",
      "Lawson was given the Red Bull seat despite not having previously driven a full F1 season and struggled immediately. The New Zealander did not score any points, crashed out of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and qualified in last place for the Chinese Grand Prix and its sprint race.",
      "Tsunoda moves up from Red Bull\u2019s second team, Racing Bulls, in time for his home Japanese GP next week. Lawson will take Tsunoda\u2019s place at Racing Bulls alongside rookie Isack Hadjar.",
      "The change is a sign of how cut-throat F1 can be and an admission that Red Bull made the wrong choice in picking Lawson. He completed only 11 career F1 races before this season and was typically slower than Tsunoda across their six races as teammates last year.",
      "\u201cIt has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the (car) at the first two races and as a result we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch,\u201d Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe came into the 2025 season with two ambitions, to retain the world drivers\u2019 championship and to reclaim the world constructors\u2019 title and this is a purely sporting decision.\u201d",
      "Horner acknowledged there was work to be done with the team\u2019s RB21 car and said Tsunoda\u2019s experience will prove beneficial in helping to develop it.",
      "\u201cWe have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam and, together, we see that after such a difficult start it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience, as he continues his F1 career with Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well,\u201d Horner said.",
      "Replacing Lawson so quickly is in stark contrast to the patience shown Verstappen\u2019s former teammate Sergio Perez, who was handed a two-year contract extension midway through a disappointing 2024 season. The team eventually dropped Perez for Lawson in December after four years.",
      "Lawson spoke publicly about his difficulties with the RB21 car, saying on Sunday it was \u201ctricky\u201d to drive and had a \u201cvery small window\u201d for the setup to be competitive. That echoed comments from Perez last year that the car became increasingly difficult to handle as Red Bull\u2019s development work leaned toward Verstappen\u2019s driving style.",
      "The 24-year-old Tsunoda has been in F1 since 2021 with a career-best championship placing of 12th last year and has yet to finish on the podium. He\u2019s previously faced criticism within the broader Red Bull operation for a tendency to vent his frustrations over the radio during races.",
      "Tsunoda\u2019s long-term future is complicated by his personal backing from Honda, which is being replaced as Red Bull\u2019s engine supplier at the end of the year ahead of a new deal with Ford from 2026. Honda will supply Aston Martin next season.",
      "Racing Bulls team principal Laurent Mekies said he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of Tsunoda for making the move to Red Bull. \u201cHis progress last year, and more recently from the very start of 2025, has been nothing less than sensational,\u201d he said.",
      "Tsunoda becomes Verstappen\u2019s sixth teammate in 10 seasons with Red Bull. It\u2019s the first time that the main Red Bull team has changed drivers midseason since 2019 when Pierre Gasly was dropped for Alex Albon after 12 races.",
      "Verstappen is the only Red Bull driver to win a race in almost two years and the only one on the podium in nearly a year. He\u2019s scored all of the team\u2019s points in the four races since Perez placed 10th in Las Vegas in November.",

      "Raised in Moscow within the Soviet sports system by parents who were accomplished athletes, Alex Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed at hockey and along the way showed he didn\u2019t need special treatment",
      "Alex Ovechkin almost stopped playing hockey.",
      "His mother, Tatyana, was a basketball player, his father, Mikhail, was a soccer player and they were traveling with their teams, leaving no one to take young Alex to practice. Coach Vyacheslav Kirillov begged Tatyana to get him back in the sport until she gave in.",
      "Good thing, too. When Ovechkin was 12 and playing in a competitive Moscow youth league. he realized he needed three goals to break a record set by Pavel Bure. He scored six times the next game.",
      "A few years later, other parents thought putting Ovechkin on the first line with Dynamo was favoritism because his parents worked for the club, so Tatyana asked the coach to demote him. He made the fourth line the team's best.",
      "Raised in the final years of the Soviet sports system by parents who were already accomplished athletes, Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed and, along the way, showed he didn't need special treatment. He evolved into a superstar on the ice and the top NHL draft pick by the Washington Capitals in 2004.",
      "Over the past 20 years, he became a Stanley Cup champion who celebrated by swimming in fountains \u2014 he has long been known as a fun-loving person \u2014 and teammates watched him develop into a husband, father and a generous person paying for dinners on the road and growing reflective on his career and accomplishments. Next on that list will be breaking Wayne Gretzky's career goals record.",
      "\u201cHe was a very, very bright young man in terms of his goal-setting for his life,\" said Hockey Hall of Famer Igor Larionov, who met Ovechkin as a teenager. \"He was determined. He was one of the fastest players on the ice, and he had a purpose. Every time he stepped on the ice, he was going to be the best.\"",
      "Born Sept. 17, 1985, and coming of age just as the Soviet Union was giving way to a new Russia, Ovechkin was drawn to the game through his father. If Mikhail's gifts had a bigger impact, his son might have been more like goaltender Vladislav Tretiak than a power forward and pure scorer.",
      "\"He would go on some trips and bring me some goalie helmets,\" Ovechkin once recalled. \"I didn\u2019t know what it was, except it was something about hockey, and when I was a little kid everything was about hockey, hockey, hockey.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin embraced hockey and showed he was good at it. When marketing executive Steven Warshaw went to Moscow in the 1990s to work for the Pittsburgh Penguins after they invested in a team there, he heard all about the next generation of Russian stars.",
      "\u201cThey give them everything they can -- the best coaching, the best everything,\u201d Warshaw said. \u201cHe was definitely given a jump start as all great athletes are, especially when you have the lineage.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was 14 when Larionov, by that time already a three-time Cup champion, sat with him in the locker room and shared some advice about doing extra summer training and committing to training in the gym.",
      "\u201cHe knew at home from the parents, from mom and dad, to be successful you have to be determined to do extra things off ice, on ice and follow the right steps,\u201d Larionov said. \"It\u2019s synergy between genetics from his parents, his approach to the game, his drive, his fire, his power that made him a great player.\u201d",
      "At 17, Ovechkin scored a tournament-best six goals in seven games to help Russia repeat as world junior champions and was again the leading scorer the following year as he emerged as the top prospect in the NHL draft, just ahead of countryman Evgeni Malkin.",
      "The lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season delayed Ovechkin's North American arrival, but on his first shift Ovechkin hit an opponent so hard he dislodged the partition holding the plexiglass together. He also scored career goal No. 1, then goal No. 2 on the way to getting 52 of them and becoming rookie of the year.",
      "\u201cHe was actually making giant, massive steps toward stardom and started scoring goals, got his confidence,\u201d Larionov said. \"The Washington Capitals got the right players around him to kind of fit him and use his biggest strength, power, speed and shot.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin led the NHL in goals and points in 2008-09, helping the Capitals make the playoffs in his third season and first of three as NHL MVP.",
      "Ovechkin still visits Russia, usually annually, and he has been criticized for his relationship with Vladimir Putin after expressing support for the Russian president in November 2017 ahead of an election. At the time, he told The AP and Washington Post, \u201cI just support my country\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about political stuff.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was surrounded by young talent in his early years in Washington. Center Nicklas Backstrom, defenseman Mike Green and winger Alexander Semin joined and made hockey in the nation's capital must-see entertainment. They were also having plenty of fun off the ice.",
      "\u201cHe should\u2019ve been out having his fun and having a new car every other week,\u201d retired teammate Mike Knuble said. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of like, \u2018Oh, what car\u2019s he driving this week?\u2019 And just having a good, old time doing whatever he wanted to do and just playing hockey and bagging individual awards.\u201d",
      "In a sport that defines players for winning championships, Knuble worried that Ovechkin would be known only for the individual accomplishments because the playoff success wasn't coming. The Capitals went through a series of changes from the front office to the coaching staff and the roster, culminating with Ovechkin leading them to the Stanley Cup in 2018 as playoff MVP.",
      "\u201cHe just didn't want to let it go,\u201d Backstrom said of the Cup.",
      "Even though Ovechkin was 32, he and the Capitals celebrated like few teams in recent history. They famously swam in the Georgetown fountains \u2014 a plaque now marks the spot \u2014 and the entire run showed the best of Ovechkin.",
      "\u201cA big heart like a big kid,\u201d longtime teammate John Carlson said. \u201cHe loves coming to the rink and he loves scoring goals and playing like we did when we were kids.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin changed off the ice, too. He and Nastya Shubskaya married in 2016, and the couple had even more reason to celebrate the summer of 2018 when she gave birth their first son, Sergei, that August. Ilya, was born in the spring of 2020, and the boys have been right there with their dad for many of his big moments since.",
      "When Ovechkin scored his 801st and 802nd goals just before Christmas 2022, to pass Gordie Howe for second on the all-time list, he walked into the locker room hand-in-hand with Sergei and Ilya and put them on his lap to take photos.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, you have to think about your family, kids first, Nast, me,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt changed 100%.\u201d",
      "At 2023 All-Star Weekend in South Florida, possibly Ovechkin's last appearance at one of those, Sergei joined him on the ice in a matching \u201cOvi Jr.\u201d jersey with, of course, his dad's signature No. 8.",
      "\u201cHe will remember that for all his life,\u201d Ovechkin said.",
      "Knuble has enjoyed seeing Ovi the dad take this in maybe even more than the goal-scorer. Tom Wilson, a teammate since 2013, now a father and likely to succeed Ovechkin as captain, has witnessed the growth firsthand \u2014 joining them for family vacations and seeing him as a family man, playing \u201cDance Dance Revolution\u201d with his nephews and nieces.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Even at home, where Ovechkin enjoys spending time with his wife, kids and their 9-year-old black lab, Blake.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t think about hockey,\u201d he said. \"You don\u2019t think about the training or practice. You just enjoy your life, enjoy your time with the kids, with family, with friends and you can basically do whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Backstrom met Ovechkin nearly two decades ago before either was 21. The fun times, the Cup win and hundreds of goals between them have come and gone.",
      "\"He\u2019s always been the same,\" Backstrom said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed a lot since the first time I met him: the same kind of outgoing person.\u201d",
      "Former teammate Nate Schmidt called Ovechkin \u201cunapologetically himself.\u201d Marcus Johansson, who played his first seven NHL seasons with Washington and had another stint with the Capitals, said Ovechkin is inviting, has \u201cgot a big heart and he takes care of the people around him.\u201d",
      "That's what current center Dylan Strome tells friends and folks back home when they ask what Ovechkin is like.",
      "\u201cVery, very, very generous with his time, his money \u2014 going out of his way for people,\u201d Strome said. \u201cHe always wants to be with the guys, whether it\u2019s watch sports or just talk or whatever or have a couple beers, he\u2019s always in for that.\u201d",
      "Carlson believes the 39-year-old Ovechkin has stayed young as the age gap between veterans and young teammates in the locker room grows, while at the same time appreciating each moment a little more. Wilson has seen Ovechkin sign dozens of pucks, sticks and jerseys for other teams after a game without the slightest hesitation.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t even really describe him in words,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy that\u2019s bigger than life, bigger than hockey. A personality that whenever he does hang them up, the game will miss him a lot.\u201d",

      "Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s flashbacks to her November crash in the giant slalom are happening less and less when she\u2019s training",
      "SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- Mikaela Shiffrin's flashbacks to her November crash in a giant slalom race are happening less and less when she's training.",
      "For her, as she deals with post-traumatic stress disorder in the discipline, that's major progress.",
      "While other racers compete in the GS on Tuesday at World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Shiffrin plans to squeeze in some training in the slalom. It will be the American standout's only event of the weeklong finals after not qualifying in giant slalom.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion revealed last month that she\u2019s suffering from PTSD after falling in the GS on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont. In the crash, something punctured Shiffrin's side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin skipped the giant slalom at world championships and has raced the discipline three times since, with her best showing 25th place.",
      "But she's back to turning in fast sections at practice in the GS, a discipline that blends speed and technical skill.",
      "\u201cTraining is going well. It\u2019s actually super positive. Training has been improving day-by-day,\u201d Shiffrin said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday before signing autographs for fans. \u201cI'm just trying to get back to the confidence that I was skiing with in Killington when the crash happened. That would be a big goal.\u201d",
      "On that day, Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS as she charged after her 100th World Cup win. The finish line was in sight on her final run, when she lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis.",
      "The all-time winningest Alpine World Cup ski racer then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing. She still doesn't know what led to the puncture wound.",
      "To help with getting back in the giant slalom start gate, she's been working with a psychologist. Leading into world championships and the GS, she checked most of the boxes for PTSD symptoms. A few weeks later in Are, Sweden, she checked fewer.",
      "\u201cMy processing speed and the mind-body connection has come back in a great way,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who earned her 100th World Cup win last month in Italy. \"But every now and then I\u2019ll still have the sort of intrusive images or thoughts cross my mind of crashing or the pain. Normally, it\u2019s in the start gate. If I\u2019m starting to get a little bit tired in a session, I just imagine everything that could go wrong and it\u2019s kind of an intense reaction.",
      "\u201cBut it happens so much less often now. It does feel very true that simply exposure to doing the thing that\u2019s pretty uncomfortable is helpful.\u201d",
      "Following her slalom training session Tuesday, Shiffrin will be watching as New Zealand\u2019s Alice Robinson tries to hold off Italy\u2019s Federica Brignone for the crystal globe in the giant slalom.",
      "The 30-year-old Shiffrin can see glimpses of her GS form returning. She won an Olympic gold medal in the discipline at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and 22 of her 100 World Cup victories have come in giant slalom.",
      "\u201cSome of my turns are competitive with the fastest in the world,\u201d said Shiffrin, whose slalom race is Thursday. \u201cBut putting that together for a minute and 10-second GS run \u2014 that just takes time and repetition. We\u2019ll need to try to get some days this summer with long course sets, with a lot of variation of course sets, variation of conditions. I don\u2019t doubt that I can get to that competitive level again.",
      "\"I think a lot of my skiing is already there.\u201d",

      "Former UFC champion Cain Velasquez has been sentenced to five years in prison for a shooting in 2022 where he chased after the man accused of molesting his son",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Former UFC champion Cain Velasquez was sentenced to five years in prison Monday for a shooting in 2022 where he chased after the man accused of molesting his son.",
      "Velasquez was sentenced in Santa Clara County after he pled no contest to attempted murder, felony assault, and other related gun charges last August for what the district attorney's office called a \u201cvigilante shooting spree.\u201d He will receive credit for time served.",
      "In February 2022, the two-time UFC heavyweight champion fired a gun multiple times at a truck carrying three people, including 46-year-old Harry Goularte, who is facing felony child molestation charges, according to the district attorney's office.",
      "His defense attorney, Renee Hessling, called the result \u201cbittersweet\u201d as they had hoped to keep Velasquez out of prison.",
      "\u201cThroughout it all, Cain has shown courage and strength of character,\" Hessling said in a statement. \u201cHe has taken responsibility for his actions and has been held accountable. The sentence handed down today reflects the complexities of the situation and acknowledges the man behind the headlines.\u201d",
      "Less than a week prior to the shooting, Goularte was arrested in connection to the sexual assault of a 4-year-old at the daycare owned by his family. He was released without bail a few days later. Officials said he was released under house arrest and was on his way to retrieve an electronic monitoring bracelet when Velasquez attacked.",
      "Velasquez shot at Goularte's truck in a car chase that lasted for 11 miles (17.7 kilometers), the district attorney\u2019s office said. Goularte was uninjured, but his stepfather, who was driving, was hit twice.",
      "Velasquez has said the sexual assault incident involved his child and is suing Goularte and his family\u2019s daycare for negligence and sexual battery.",
      "On his former teammate Kyle Kingsbury's podcast, Velasquez said the way he handled the situation was \u201cnot the way to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot put the law in our own hands,\" Velasquez said. \"I know what I did, and I know what I did was very dangerous to other people, you know? Not just to people involved, but innocent people. I understand what I did and I\u2019m willing to do everything I have to, to pay that back.\u201d",
      "Velasquez also said it was important to have open and honest with your kids about what kind of behavior is acceptable and listen to what they say.",
      "\u201cOne man\u2019s decision to take the law into his own hands left an innocent man wounded and endangered schoolchildren, teachers, and many others in our community,\" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. \"If you want to do justice in Santa Clara County, please apply for a badge.\u201d",

      "The 34-year-old Brignone entered the day 20 points behind Robinson in the last World Cup giant slalom race of the season. Robinson struggled with a gate in her first run, veered off course and didn't finish, paving the way for Brignone.",

    "story": [
      "Tests are underway at Cortina\u2019s controversial Olympic sliding track",
      "ROME -- When Italian skeleton competitor Mattia Gaspari became the first athlete to test the controversial sliding track for next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, he did so in a sort of tunnel under a temporary roof built of wooden beams and white plastic paper.",
      "That's because the sliding center in Cortina d'Ampezzo is still under construction and the only part that is really finished is the track structure.",
      "Still, getting to this point little more than a year after construction began is a big achievement for the Italian government, which rebuilt the century-old track despite calls from the International Olympic Committee to hold bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes at a venue in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite an adventure,\u201d Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the construction firm, which was the first one to believe in this, and the journalists who motivated us,\u201d said Salvini, who is also the deputy premier, citing articles claiming that the project would never be done. \u201cWell, here we are.\u201d",
      "Olympic bronze medalist Dominik Fischnaller was the second athlete down the track on his luge before Simone Bertazzo and Eric Fantazzini made a two-man bobsled run.",
      "Simico, the government agency in charge of the 118 million euro ($128 million) project, reported positive results for the test runs. But it will be officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation and the IOC to determine whether to bestow preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track.",
      "Preliminary approval would be a big step in avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time. Lake Placid officials were hopeful that, if the sliding events were going to be awarded to the U.S., the official word would come by the end of March.",
      "Construction on the Cortina track began in February last year. The pre-homologation plan calls for athletes to begin their initial runs from the junior start, well below the ramps from where they would begin to race for World Cup and Olympic competitions. Sliders would move up the track slowly throughout the coming days.",
      "There are testing events at the Cortina track for all three sliding sports \u2014 bobsled, skeleton and luge \u2014 scheduled for throughout the fall. Those are important so that sliders can familiarize themselves with the track and feel safe there when competing at the Olympics. Safety has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "Luge athletes are scheduled to have an international training period at the new track from Oct. 27 through Nov. 2, then return for a test event there in the final week of November. The bobsled and skeleton tours will hold their international training period from Nov. 7-16, followed by the season-opening World Cup races there from Nov. 17-23.",
      "The 1.749-kilometer (1.09-mile) track features 16 curves with an estimated top speed of 145 kph (90 mph) with run times slated for 55-60 seconds.",
      "Athletes from 12 nations are involved in the tests this week. It's about 60 athletes in all, about half of them being Italian sliders. Coaches representing at least 23 different sliding nations were also invited to view this week's events.",

      "Duke guard Tyrese Proctor has made 13 of 16 3-pointers through two games of the NCAA Tournament",
      "It wasn't that long ago that Tyrese Proctor was struggling to make much of anything outside the arc. Shot after shot clanged away in a befuddling stretch of misses spanning nearly a month of the stretch run for Duke's national-title contender.",
      "Now he can't miss.",
      "The junior guard has been on an absolute tear with his outside shot, hitting at least six 3-pointers for the past three games going back to the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament final. It's been a boost to an offense already humming at elite efficiency as the top-seeded Blue Devils head into Thursday's matchup with Arizona in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament's East Region in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cI think the main thing is the mentality of it,\" Proctor said after Sunday's second-round win against Baylor. \"I'm just shooting knowing the ball is going to go in and not hoping it's going in as the big thing.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-6 guard from Australia has made 19 of 28 3-pointers (67.9%) since missing his first two attempts in the ACC title-game win against Louisville. And he's only gotten hotter with each passing possession.",
      "First came a 6-for-8 output in the first round against Mount St. Mary's \u2014 the kind of shooting display that's typically more of a one-game blip than a sustained push.",
      "Only he topped that two days later, making 7 of 8 against the Bears.",
      "That's 13 for 16 through two March Madness games, a shocking 81.3% hit rate. The 13 made 3s are the most of any player in the Sweet 16, with Houston's LJ Cryer and Tennessee's Chaz Lanier each hitting 10 as the only other players to reach double figures so far.",
      "And Proctor is striking from a variety of ways: on the catch in transition, curling around a screen, using a stepback, even pump-faking a defender off his feet and then resetting off a single dribble to his right \u2014 a move he pulled three times to send a Baylor player flying by on Sunday.",
      "As he kept burying the Bears, he flashed triumphant gestures and unleashed I'm-feeling-it screams toward a home-state crowd as he retreated back to the defensive end.",
      "\u201cSuch a talented player, such a weapon for us when he\u2019s being confident looking for his shot,\u201d freshman star Cooper Flagg said.",
      "The Blue Devils (33-3) have long counted on Proctor as a starter with perimeter length, giving him the ability to create matchup problems at both ends for smaller guards. He has long been a complementary scorer behind Flagg and another freshman in Kon Knueppel, and was averaging 11.8 points entering the Louisville game.",
      "But his kicked-up offense behind that 3-point shot through the last three games has increased his scoring average by approaching a full point (12.5).",
      "It was hard to see this coming as recently as 10 days ago.",
      "After a strong start to February, Proctor's outside shot suddenly abandoned him. Over the next seven games, he would miss 23 of 29 3-pointers, including a pair of 0-for-5 days to start the ACC Tournament. By the time he missed his first two against Louisville in the final, Proctor had missed 14 straight 3s going back to missing his last two in the regular-season finale at rival North Carolina.",
      "Proctor spent time looking at film of his shot with assistant Will Avery after the first two games of the ACCs, trying to decipher where things were misfiring.",
      "\u201cIt's just little things \u2014 just my balance and stuff like that,\" Proctor said. \"At the end of the day, it's just confidence. As soon as my feet get set and I hold my follow-through, I'm just going to keep trusting it.",
      "\"All the 0-for, whatever it was, all that felt good. A couple of them I knew what I did wrong. I think it's just realizing and understanding that, and just fixing it on the fly is a big thing.\u201d",
      "It's a challenge any shooter can understand: finding a delicate balance of tweaking any deficiencies showing up in the form, yet not meddling too much with what has worked for so long.",
      "So far it's working.",
      "\u201cIt's hard, earlier this season I struggled with that,\" Knueppel said. \u201cYou've just got to keep shooting it, that's the only way you can make more shots, is you keep shooting them. So he's done a great job of just being confident. He's really attacking his catches and getting locked and loaded, and ready to go.\u201d",

      "The Wildcats look up to him in part because they know what he\u2019s accomplished. The 6-foot-2 guard is making his fifth straight tournament appearance. His jumper as time expired in a 2023 NCAA semifinal gave San Diego State a 72-71 victory over Florida Atlantic, sending the Aztecs into a championship game they lost to UConn.",
      "\u201cMost of us talk about what happened to us,\u201d Pope said. \u201cWe talk about what happened to us. And champions, winners talk about what they made happen. It\u2019s just the truth. It\u2019s true.",
      "\u201cLamont Butler is spending his whole lifetime talking about what he makes happen, and that\u2019s a champion\u2019s heart. And he doesn\u2019t spend any time talking about what happened to him. He talks about all the stuff he makes happen. When you have a guy like that leading your crew like that, it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",
      "Pope related a story from last summer when he was on the road recruiting and the team had planned something for a player who was going through a difficult family situation: \u201cI called in to check with that player and see how the day went, and he had scrapped all the plans because Lamont scooped him up and they spent the day together. And Lamont did that because that\u2019s who he is. He cares.\u201d",
      "Butler said he knew even around that time that this Kentucky team was capable of putting together a run similar to the one his San Diego State team made two years ago - and perhaps doing even more.",
      "\u201cI kind of expected us to be in a good position from the summer to go win a national championship,\u201d Butler said prior to the NCAA Tournament. \u201cThat\u2019s on our mind. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d",
      "Butler is averaging 11.1 points and 4.3 assists \u2013 career highs in both categories \u2013 despite dealing with a left shoulder injury dating to mid-January that cost him six games. He hurt it again in the Southeastern Conference Tournament and didn\u2019t play in a quarterfinal loss to Alabama.",
      "Butler returned for a 76-57 first-round NCAA victory over Troy and didn\u2019t score at all, but he still contributed in so many other ways that he had a plus-minus rating of plus-22. Butler, who has been wearing a brace on the shoulder, had 14 points and five assists in an 84-75 second-round triumph over Illinois.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really a dog,\u201d Kentucky guard Otega Oweh said. \u201cGoing out there with one arm and giving it his all. He\u2019s playing defense, and on top of that, he\u2019s getting us into our offense. When you have someone that\u2019s doing that, it just trickles down. You just want to out there and fight for him, too.\u201d",
      "Butler had three of Kentucky\u2019s 14 steals against Illinois. After the game, Kentucky guard Koby Brea had a simple explanation for why the Wildcats were able to force Illinois into so many turnovers.",
      "\u201cWe have Lamont Butler as the head of defense,\u201d Brea said. \u201cSo I feel like for any team, when you see him pick you up, it has to put something in your stomach, some nerves or something.\u201d",
      "Butler scares his opponents while calming his teammates. He\u2019s providing the presence this team full of transfers needed as they try to get Kentucky back to the Final Four for the first time in a decade.",
      "\u201cI think everybody is hungry this year,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI feel like a lot of us came from smaller schools or different places and we were able to compete at one of the best schools ever. We all wanted to be remembered here.\u201d",
      "Butler already was going to be remembered for that shot he hit two years ago. Now he\u2019s creating a whole new set of memories while wearing a different uniform.",

      "The NFL competition committee is recommending making the dynamic kickoff rule permanent and moving touchbacks to the 35-yard line in hopes of generating even more returns.",
      "The competition committee released several potential rule changes for 2025 on Wednesday, including an expansion of instant replay that will be considered next week at the league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida. Any rule change must be approved by 24 out of 32 team owners.",
      "Teams submitted several proposals last week that also could be voted on at the league meetings, including banning the \u201ctush push\u201d and changing playoff seeding rules.",
      "Owners approved a major change to the kickoff last year on a one-year trial basis and the committee recommended another change to increase the rate of returns without increasing the risk of injuries. The league had 332 additional returns last season with the rate increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season.",
      "The committee hopes that moving the touchback on kicks that reach the end zone on the fly from the 30 to the 35 will incentivize kicking teams to opt for shorter kicks that lead to more returns.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing teams to declare their intention for an onside kick at any point in the game when they are trailing instead of only in the fourth quarter.",
      "The committee proposed a few other tweaks to how players on the return team can align before the kick but the basics will remain the same with the kicker lining up at his own 35, the 10 coverage players at the 40, and at least nine blockers lined up in the \u201csetup zone\u201d between the 30- and 35-yard line and up to two returners in the landing zone inside the 20.",
      "Any kick that reaches the end zone in the air can be returned, or the receiving team can opt for a touchback, which now will be at the 35.",
      "Only the kicker and two returners are allowed to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20.",
      "According to the NFL, there were 59 returns of at least 40 yards last season, the most in the league since 2016, and seven TD returns. The concussion rate fell 43% from the previous three years and there were the fewest lower-extremity strains on kick return plays since 2018.",
      "The committee also proposed an expansion of instant replay to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn't occur. Replay would also be able to overturn a roughing the kicker or running into the kicker penalty if video replay showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing two players to be designated to return from injured reserve if they are placed on IR when rosters are reduced to 53, granting playoff teams two more return from IR spots in the postseason, and using point differential as the third tiebreaker on waiver claims.",

      "There almost certainly won\u2019t be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball\u2019s next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters",
      "There almost certainly won't be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball's next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters.",
      "Still, plenty of talented players are going into their final seasons before potentially becoming free agents for the first time.",
      "Vladimir Guerrero Jr., five-tool player Kyle Tucker and starting pitchers Dylan Cease, Framber Valdez and Zac Gallen could all become available to other teams after this season. Three-time batting champion Luis Arr\u00e1ez and Bo Bichette, who twice led the American League in hits, could also be first-time free agents.",
      "Guerrero, like Soto already a four-time All-Star and Home Run Derby champion at age 26, had set a self-imposed deadline for negotiating a long-term agreement with Toronto. That passed at the start of spring training without a new deal, when he said he wanted to stay but would listen to other teams in free agency.",
      "Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro remained optimistic going into the season that the team would eventually sign the first baseman to a contract extension.",
      "Soto\u2019s $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in December came after Ohtani got a $700 million, 10-year deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers the previous offseason. Guerrero told ESPN in an interview after his deadline passed that he was seeking a similar contract length as Soto but noted that his last offer was for less than $600 million.",
      "Here are some of the players eligible for free agency after this year\u2019s World Series:",
      "Guerrero, who will make $28.5 million this season, hit a career-best .323 last year with a .940 OPS, 30 homers and 103 RBIs in his fourth consecutive All-Star season. Over six seasons with the Blue Jays, he has a .288 average with 160 homers and 507 RBIs in 819 games. He finished second in the 2021 AL MVP voting behind unanimous choice Ohtani.",
      "Houston clearly wasn't planning to pay the price to keep Tucker in free agency, so the Astros traded the three-time All-Star and Gold Glove-winning right fielder to Chicago in December for a third baseman, starting pitcher and top prospect outfielder that are all under team control for multiple seasons. The 28-year-old Tucker was limited to 78 games last year because of a fractured right shin, and still hit 23 homers. He had a combined 59 homers, 219 RBIs and 55 stolen bases in 2022-23.",
      "The 29-year-old Cease has 130 starts over the last four seasons, twice finishing in the top four in Cy Young Award voting. He was the AL runner-up behind unanimous winner Justin Verlander while with White Sox in 2022, and fourth in the NL last year when 14-11 with a 3.47 ERA in 33 starts after being traded to the playoff-bound Padres during spring training from a Chicago team that went on to lose 121 games. Cease has 1,016 career strikeouts in 847 1/3 innings.",
      "One of the game's best left-handed starters, the 31-year-old Valdez has a 68-41 career record and is Houston's opening-day starter for the fourth year in a row. He was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA in 28 games last season, his fifth in a row to finish with a winning record. The workhorse threw a no-hitter in 2023 and averaged more than 191 innings the past three years.",
      "The 29-year-old Gallen, 14-6 last year, is 43-19 with a 3.20 ERA in 93 starts the past three seasons. Arizona got him his rookie season in 2019 when it traded Jazz Chisholm Jr. to Miami. The Diamondbacks just gave 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner and four-time All-Star right-hander Corbin Burnes a $210 million, six-year deal, the richest in franchise history. That could significantly impact whether they will also be able to keep Gallen, twice a top-five finisher in Cy Young voting.",
      "Arr\u00e1ez has back-to-back 200-hit seasons, part of three batting titles in a row while finishing each of those seasons with a different team. The Padres acquired him last year in a midseason trade from Miami, which got him from Minnesota after his first batting title with the Twins in 2022. He goes into this season with a .323 career average and only 194 strikeouts in 2,858 career plate appearances.",
      "A calf injury and then a broken right middle finger limited Bichette to 81 games last season, and the 27-year-old two-time All-Star hit a career-low .225 with only four homers. Before that, he led the AL in hits in 2021 and 2022, and batted .306 in 2023 during his third consecutive 20-homer season.",
      "Ozuna, who turns 35 next November, played in all 162 games for the first time last year and was an All-Star for the third time \u2014 first since 2016. He has 79 homers and 204 RBIs over the past two years.",
      "Bieber had 20 strikeouts in 12 scoreless innings last season before Tommy John surgery and becoming a free agent for the first time. Cleveland re-signed the 2020 AL Cy Young winner even though he won\u2019t pitch until later this season, during which the pitcher with a 62-32 career record turns 30. He does have a $16 million player option for 2026.",
      "34-year-old catcher J.T. Realmuto, 32-year-old slugger Kyle Schwarber and 29-year-old left-handed starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez are going into the final seasons of their contracts with the Phillies after being key figures for three consecutive playoff seasons. That began with that 2022 NL pennant that ended a decade-long postseason drought. Schwarber has 131 homers and 302 RBIs in that three-season span, along with 318 walks and 612 strikeouts.",

      "And then, they\u2019ll be on opposite sides \u2014 just like they were in his final weeks as a member of the team.",
      "The Heat will pay tribute to Butler\u2019s 5\u00bd seasons with the team with a pregame video on Tuesday night, one that will be shown in the arena as part of the introduction of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 starting lineup for the game.",
      "Butler said he\u2019ll watch the video, though added that it didn\u2019t matter to him whether the Heat did one or not. He\u2019s insisting that there\u2019s no hard feelings now, a month and a half after he was traded to the Warriors following a contentious breakup that saw him suspended by Miami three times in his final weeks with the team.",
      "He wasn\u2019t happy with the Heat, not getting an extension and had issues with his role. The Heat weren\u2019t happy with how he missed about 25% of their games during his tenure with the club and how he took his complaints public in the final months.",
      "Butler got his extension \u2014 two years, $111 million \u2014 from the Warriors, and Golden State was 16-3 in his first 19 appearances with the team entering Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always painted as the bad guy,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve always been a problem. We\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t got nothing to say. I\u2019m not mad at being a bad guy. It\u2019s all the way everything\u2019s portrayed. Some people talk to the media, some people don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been one to tell my side of the story to almost anybody. Let everybody think that this is what happened. We\u2019ll ride with it.\u201d",
      "Fans, as they tend to be when a top player leaves their team, have not been shy about hiding their anger with Butler on social media. Butler knows things didn\u2019t end well in his Miami tenure, though notes that he believes there\u2019s more than enough blame to go around for the messy breakup.",
      "\u201cI wonder if they look at the Heat the same way,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like I was the one who was doing everything. It\u2019s got to be 50-50, maybe 51-49 \u2014 49 towards them, 51 towards me. But there\u2019s no way that I was the cause of all of this.\u201d",
      "Butler wound up being suspended for a total of 14 Heat games before the trade. But the Heat have a tradition of welcoming back players who were All-Stars or champions with the team; Butler was an All-Star in Miami who led the team to three Eastern Conference finals berths and two trips to the NBA Finals.",

      "Viktor Hovland can sound like a player who is bent on perfection",
      "Golf doesn't have to be that complicated. Viktor Hovland only makes it sound that way.",
      "Hovland was confounding as ever at the Valspar Championship. His confidence was so low that he arrived at Innisbrook uncertain if he was even going to play, and then five days later he delivered two clutch swings during the toughest stretch on the Copperhead course to rally for a one-shot victory he never saw coming.",
      "Only the trophy was satisfying.",
      "\u201cYeah, it's still not great,\u201d he said when asked if he was happy with his swing.",
      "Hovland rarely is. And that's why the 27-year-old Norwegian star could say without sounding offensive how proud he was to win on such a tough golf course \u201cwith not my best stuff.\u201d",
      "There is constant searching, not just to win but to hit shots the way he expects. Hovland has questions and he wants answers, and he won't stop looking until he finds them.",
      "He is not wired like Dustin Johnson, who made a career-defining decision to go from hitting a draw to hitting a fade. After winning the U.S. Open and a World Golf Championship in consecutive starts in 2016, Johnson was asked how he went about making such a big change.",
      "\u201cWell, I was just struggling with the draw to get it in the fairway,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to hit a fade.' And I started hitting a fade.\u201d",
      "Simple, right?",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have had the same swing coach since they were about 8. Hovland has made 11 coaching changes since leaving Oklahoma State in 2019, some of them brought back on more than one occasion.",
      "What hasn't changed is his mission \u2014 to hit pure shots \u2014 no matter how many detours.",
      "Hovland reached what looked like the summit in August 2023 when he had a 65-61 weekend at Olympia Fields to win the BMW Championship, and then a 66-63 weekend at East Lake to win the Tour Championship and capture the FedEx Cup. He went 3-1-1 at the Ryder Cup, including partnering with Ludvig Aberg for a 9-and-7 win over Scheffler and Brooks Koepka.",
      "He returned from a winter's break in Norway and felt lost again.",
      "It was at Bay Hill a year ago when Hovland was asked the difference between winning without his best stuff or hitting it great and finishing fifth.",
      "\u201cI guess that\u2019s kind of the insane part of my brain is that I just enjoy flushing a golf shot,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re out here to compete and win tournaments. But I really just cherish being able to hit the shots exactly the way I want to. I think it\u2019s a better predictor of how you\u2019re going to play in the future.\u201d",
      "Therein lies the secret. He can win without his best stuff because he's very good. What he lacks is consistently strong finishes. He has never gone more than five straight tournaments in the top 10, which pales compared with the elite in the game.",
      "But he can contend out of nowhere, such as his third place in the PGA Championship last year at Valhalla when he wondered why he even bothered showing up. That wasn't a threat, more a state of his mind. He also was runner-up at a FedEx Cup playoff event last year.",
      "He doesn't doubt his ability, only what he has referred to as the \u201cmachinery.\u201d",
      "Perfection in golf is something to chase, not attain. That's why Hovland was amused at the label of being a perfectionist.",
      "\u201cI guess you can use that word to describe it,\u201d he said. \"I just view it as if you put your heart and soul into doing something, you might as well do it right. I\u2019ve swung the club extremely well and I think my ball striking has been really, really good over a long period of time. And then when it\u2019s not doing that, I\u2019m going to work on that, I\u2019m going to figure it out.",
      "\u201cI find it kind of weird that we\u2019re professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, \u2018Oh he\u2019s a perfectionist, he\u2019s out on the perimeter searching too much.\u2019 That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments.\"",
      "That's worked out just fine for Bryson DeChambeau, renowned for going down rabbit holes and leaving enough bread crumbs to find his way out if needed.",
      "Hovland won with intelligent course management and good fortune. He could feel the club being out of position at the top, forcing him to try to save it on the way down. The timing worked in his favor at Innisbrook, particularly that 7-iron to 5 feet on the 16th hole Sunday.",
      "And so the trophy from the Valspar Championship is in hand \u2014 his 11th worldwide \u2014 and the search continues. He is back with Grant Waite (for the second time), and the immediate goal is to be ready for the Masters. He\u2019s not sure the swing he had at Innisbrook will work at Augusta National.",
      "The chase continues, with no apologies.",
      "\u201cWhen you're struggling with something, it's just problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd problems are usually a lack of information. I would encourage people to go out and seek more information and try it out for yourselves. See if it helps your problems. And if it doesn't, then you've got to seek more answers. And you keep going and keep going.\u201d",

      "STANFORD, Calif. -- Stanford fired football coach Troy Taylor following a report last week that he had been investigated twice for allegedly mistreating staffers.",
      "General manager Andrew Luck announced the decision on Tuesday in his first major move since taking over in his role running the entire football program.",
      "\u201cSince beginning my role as general manager, I have been thoroughly assessing the entire Stanford football program,\u201d Luck said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cIt has been clear that certain aspects of the program need change. Additionally, in recent days, there has been significant attention to Stanford investigations in previous years related to coach Taylor. After continued consideration it is evident to me that our program needs a reset. In consultation with university leadership I no longer believe that coach Taylor is the right coach to lead our football program.\u201d",
      "ESPN reported last week that Taylor had been investigated twice since taking over before the 2023 season over allegations of hostile and aggressive behavior, as well as personal attacks, against female staff members.",
      "Both investigations determined that Taylor\u2019s treatment of employees, particularly of women, was inconsistent with Stanford\u2019s standards, according to ESPN.",
      "The second investigation concluded that Taylor retaliated against a compliance staffer who had found seven minor NCAA infractions by \u201cseeking her removal from her assigned duties.\u201d",
      "The report said investigators had never encountered \u201cthis palpable level of animosity and disdain\u201d for a university compliance office, according to ESPN.",
      "Luck thanked Taylor for his time but said it was important to instill the proper culture at Stanford.",
      "\u201cWe have powerful traditions, incredible student-athletes, and a vision for the future that demonstrates our strong potential as a program,\u201d Luck said. \"This vision includes an emphasis on a positive, winning, and inclusive culture. I am confident that we will return Stanford to the top echelon of college football.\u201d",
      "Luck was hired last November to oversee the football program and he reports directly to school President Jonathan Levin. Athletic director Bernard Muir announced last month that he is leaving at the end of the academic year and Stanford is looking for a replacement.",
      "But Luck will be in charge of the football program and now needs to find a coach who can get the Cardinal back to being competitive nationally.",
      "From Luck's first season as starting quarterback in 2009 through the 2018 season, the Cardinal were tied for the sixth most wins in FBS, playing in three Rose Bowls and two other BCS bowls in a 10-year span.",
      "But Stanford is 20-46 in six seasons since then, with its .303 winning percentage ranking second worst to Vanderbilt among all power conference teams in that span.",
      "Taylor was hired after David Shaw stepped down in 2022 after his second straight 3-9 season. Taylor, who had helped build Sacramento State into an FCS power, went 3-9 in each of his two seasons with the Cardinal. Stanford went just 1-10 at home against FBS opponents under Taylor.",

      "AP All-America center Lauren Betts, Ayoka Lee and Sedona Prince are traditional post players, and all have been in the middle of their teams making it to the Sweet 16 in the women's NCAA Tournament.",
      "There just may not be as many players like them in the future with more teams opting for flexible posts who play on the perimeter and shoot 3-pointers. Plus, that is how players are now often being taught at younger ages.",
      "\u201cAll these young ladies are getting more skilled. They\u2019re able to step away from the basket. They are able to face up and play,\u201d Kansas State coach Jeff Mittie said. \u201cI think, as you\u2019re seeing youth basketball progress, that they\u2019re getting more training earlier, where not just to stand in the paint and play. ... The game has evolved.\"",
      "Even so, these women are excelling inside during this March Madness.",
      "The 6-foot-7 Betts had 30 points and 14 rebounds for top-seeded UCLA in a second-round win over Richmond. The junior has made 63.6% of her 825 career field goal attempts over three years, and has a Bruins single-season record 90 blocked shots.",
      "Prince, also 6-7, combined for 35 points and 14 rebounds to help TCU advance past the second round for the first time.",
      "The 6-6 Lee has 33 points and 19 rebounds while playing only 43 minutes combined in K-State\u2019s two tourney games, after missing 12 of the previous 13 games with a foot injury.",
      "Betts, with career averages of 13.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, said it takes more than just having the requisite size to be consistent and successful in the low post.",
      "\u201cPatience has always been my biggest thing,\" said Betts, in her second season at UCLA after one at Stanford. \u201cWhen I\u2019m catching it inside, obviously there (are) a few people running at me at a time, so just making sure I\u2019m not rushing myself.\"",
      "While UCLA coach Cori Close agrees that the game is evolving, the Bruins \u2014 who next play fifth-seeded Ole Miss on Friday night \u2014 certainly take full advantage of having their dominant center.",
      "\u201cSo it just has this domino effect, but it starts with her,\u201d Close said. \u201cThe reality for us is that if she gets a touch \u2014 people work possessions all the time just to create rotation. Like how are we going to do this, create rotation, flatten out their defense, force them to be in a scramble mode. We have a really good way. We just pass it to Lauren and force that every single time.\u201d",
      "Lee was a second-team AP All-American as a junior in 2022, the same year she set an NCAA single-game record with 61 points against Oklahoma, but missed all of the following season because of a knee injury. Her 64.1% field goal percentage this season is a career high, while averaging 15.6 points and 6.4 rebounds playing fewer than 19 minutes a game.",
      "\u201cI definitely have been a more traditional post, and that\u2019s just where my strength lies,\" Lee said. \u201cOur coaches and our team have done a good job of building a strong guard presence around that. So I haven\u2019t really had to really step out much.\u201d",
      "The fifth-seeded Wildcats play top-seeded USC on Saturday night. Earlier that day, second-seeded TCU faces third-seeded Notre Dame for the second time this season.",
      "Prince is among 11 transfers for TCU since coach Mark Campbell took over two years ago after the Horned Frogs went 1-17 in Big 12 games.",
      "Campbell was previously an Oregon assistant and overlapped some of Prince's time there. Nyara Sabally was then the prominent player inside for the Ducks, but the coach wanted Prince to dominate inside for the Horned Frogs.",
      "\u201cMe and Sedona have had healthy dialog of trying to figure out how to impose her will in games,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIf I let her, she would stay on the perimeter and shoot 3s all game. ... I think the greatest thing she\u2019s improved in is getting comfortable around the basket and imposing her will around the basket.\"",
      "Prince made the only 3 she has attempted since Christmas, and is 8 for 28 from long range in her career. Neither Betts nor Lee have shot any 3s.",
      "\u201cI was a passer and a shooter (at Oregon), and that\u2019s why I got really good at that like 12- to 15-foot range shot,\" Prince said. \"So coming here, Mark and I had the conversation of like, you need to get really, really good at catching the ball deep in the post and making simple post moves, but take advantage of being 6-7, getting stronger. Yeah, it's fun.\u201d",

      "After beating the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 on Tuesday night, they have strung together their most consecutive victories since November 2022. It's the longest active winning streak in the NHL.",
      "\u201cWe've just got a recipe that works and a game plan that everybody believes in,\u201d said Dylan Holloway, who has 24 goals in a breakout season. \u201cGuys are playing for each other. It's a good vibe in here, for sure.\u201d",
      "St. Louis has outscored opponents 36-10 and only trailed for a total of 5:24 during this winning stretch. It's just business as usual, according to Alexandre Texier.",
      "\u201cWe've got a job to do,\u201d said Texier, who like Holloway, scored against Montreal. \u201cThis game is over and we think about the next game. We're not enjoying too much about this momentum. We want to be in the playoffs. We just have to do it every single night.\u201d",
      "The Blues are 13-2-2 since the season resumed after the 4 Nations Face-Off break, outscoring opponents 70-38. No team in the NHL has more points or goals in that time.",
      "\u201cThere's a pace and a purpose to what they're doing,\u201d coach Jim Montgomery said. \u201cThey're just doing it naturally. There's smiles on their faces. They're loving doing things right.\"",
      "The formula during the streak has been simple. The Blues are strong on the forecheck and work to limit transition opportunities for their opponents. They block as many shots as possible.",
      "\u201cIt starts with the belief in this group and believing in the process and each other,\u201d said Philip Broberg, who scored a goal and had three assists against Montreal to keep his impressive season rolling. \u201cIt's all about hard work.\u201d",
      "Montgomery agreed, calling his team's effort professional.",
      "\u201cEveryone's playing well: Our top line, our top six are scoring and playing defense,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cOur bottom six are scoring and hanging on to pucks and protecting pucks. Our defense has been really solid. The little details have been there throughout the lineup. Everybody\u2019s doing it.\"",
      "Montgomery has helped turn things around since replacing fired coach Drew Bannister on Nov. 25 after a 9-12-1 start. But the Blues were still eight points behind Vancouver for the Western Conference's second and final wild-card spot coming out of the break and had not won three in a row all season.",
      "It looked like the playoff drought would reach three. Now it looks like that could end.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s a simple answer, but it\u2019s just guys playing hard, playing for one another and playing together,\u201d captain Brayden Schenn said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t all been pretty, but we\u2019re finding a way and that\u2019s the most important thing this time of the year. There\u2019s definitely buzz around the city. \u201d",
      "The Blues hold a firm grip on the second wild card in the Western Conference, four up on Calgary and five up on Vancouver. They now have the Wild \u2014 holders of the first wild card \u2014 in their sights, just two points back after Minnesota lost 5-1 to Vegas.",
      "All those teams have games in hand on the the Blues, who have nine left, compared to 12 for the Flames and 11 for the Canucks. Holloway doesn't think anyone is looking at how many games anyone has left.",
      "\u201cObviously, we know it's a tight race,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cThe biggest thing is we just have to control what we can control. We can't control other teams. The biggest thing for us is to just keep playing the way we are. It works. We just have to go a game at a time.\u201d",

      "The Cougars were No. 1 in scoring defense, more than a half-point better than the next-best team. The Bulldogs were No. 2 in scoring offense, trailing only Alabama in putting up nearly 87 points per game.",
      "Yet one of the biggest reasons that Houston was able to advance to the Sweet 16 with an 81-76 victory over the Bulldogs was its ability to play any style of basketball. Sure, the Cougars managed to hold Gonzaga nearly 10 points below its season average, but they also ramped up their own scoring, proving that they are more than just a bunch of defensive stoppers.",
      "\u201cJust win and advance,\u201d Sampson said afterward. \u201cDo what it takes. That's all that matters.\u201d",
      "Throughout the 68-team field, those that were able to survive the first weekend were often those that were willing to change things up if the moment dictated it. The defensive dynamo was able to get into transition and pile up points, or the team that loves to score buckled down at the other end of the floor, making life difficult for its unsuspecting opponent.",
      "That has been the case with Mississippi so far in the tournament.",
      "The Rebels rolled into the postseason in the top 50 nationally in scoring, but their defense was middling at best: 175th out of the 364 teams in men's Division I basketball. Yet the same bunch who scored 98 points against Kentucky and 100 against Oral Roberts in the regular season stifled North Carolina in a 71-64 first-round win, then held Iowa State below its season scoring average in a 91-78 victory that pushed Ole Miss into the regional semifinals.",
      "\u201cTheir defensive versatility is terrific,\u201d Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger marveled afterward. \u201cTheir switch ability \u2014 guards on bigs, bigs on guards. They do a great job. Their defense really tries to frustrate you by not allowing the ball to get in the paint, and trying to keep it on one side of the floor. And when they're at their best, they're doing that really well.\u201d",
      "It will take Ole Miss doing it at their best with Michigan State up next; the Spartans are among the most versatile of any team left. They are top 50 in both scoring and defense, and they showed it off last weekend, putting up 87 points against Bryant and holding New Mexico to 63 in a pair of wins.",
      "\u201cWe're just a team that can play multiple ways,\u201d the Spartans' Jaden Akins said.",
      "So is Duke, which was fourth nationally in scoring and sixth in scoring defense. And when you have that combination, the results in the opening weekend were not surprising: 93-49 over Mount St. Mary's and 89-66 over Baylor.",
      "Kentucky was sixth nationally in scoring this season, but coach Mark Pope's bunch \u2014 315th in scoring defense \u2014 played a more patient game with plenty of success in a 76-57 first-round win over Wofford. It wasn't a surprise that Arizona averaged 90 points in wins over Akron and Oregon, but it may have been that the Wildcats held the Zips to just 65 in the first round.",
      "Then there's Alabama, which looked every bit like the nation's highest-scoring team in a tougher-than-expected first-round win over Robert Morris and a second-round blitz of Saint Mary's. But the Crimson Tide also looked a lot like, say, Houston the way it defended the Gaels, holding them to just 66 points in advancing to the Sweet 16.",
      "That's where the Crimson Tide will face BYU, a team that plays much more like itself.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to say it\u2019s refreshing to go against somebody that plays like us,\u201d Tide coach Nate Oats said, \"because I think we\u2019re really tough to guard, and we\u2019ve led the country in scoring the last two years. I don\u2019t think anybody is saying it\u2019s refreshing to play Alabama, whoever is running the defense for the other team. I mean, maybe it\u2019s not such a smash-mouth game like playing football out there like some of these teams, but they\u2019re not easy to cover.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to really lock in and coaches are going to have to really do a good job getting our guys ready and then our guys are going to have to execute what the plan is, whatever we decide to put in.\u201d",

      "MUTTENZ, Switzerland -- Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini won again in court Tuesday and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors.",
      "Once soccer\u2019s most powerful men, former FIFA president Blatter and former UEFA president Platini were acquitted for a second time in a case now in its 10th year on charges of fraud, forgery, mismanagement and misappropriation of more than $2 million of FIFA money in 2011.",
      "Blatter, now aged 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers on his desk or held his left hand over his mouth.",
      "Only when the 55-minute verdict statement was over did Blatter smile before reaching across to shake his lawyer's hand. Blatter then shared a long hug with his daughter, Corinne.",
      "\u201cYou have seen my daughter was coming with tears because she believed in (her) father and I believed in myself,\u201d said Blatter, who spoke of a sword of Damocles being removed from over his head. \u201cTo wait such a long time affects the person and my family was very much affected.\"",
      "Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court's verdict in German into his native French.",
      "\u201cThis persecution by FIFA and some Swiss federal prosecutors for 10 years is now finished, is now totally finished,\" Platini said leaving the court, insisting his honor was restored. \"So I\u2019m very happy.\u201d",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office in Switzerland had challenged a first acquittal in July 2022 and asked for sentences of 20 months, suspended for two years. The indictment alleged the payment \u201cdamaged FIFA\u2019s assets and unlawfully enriched Platini.\u201d",
      "\u201cMichel Platini must finally be left in peace in criminal matters,\u201d his lawyer Dominic Nellen said in a statement. \u201dAfter two acquittals, even the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland must realize that these criminal proceedings have definitively failed.\"",
      "A further appeal to the Swiss supreme court can be filed by the prosecutors' office, which said in a statement it \u201cwill decide about how to further proceed.\u201d",
      "Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that ultimately came to nothing in court yet totally altered world soccer body FIFA.",
      "The legal case swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.",
      "Blatter approved FIFA paying 2 million Swiss francs (now $2.21 million) to France soccer great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential advisor from 1998-2002.",
      "The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly 9\u00bd years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of the two men.",
      "That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at FIFA after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.",
      "With Platini soon suspended and banned by FIFA, European soccer body UEFA ran his long-time secretary general Gianni Infantino as its election candidate. Infantino was a surprise winner in February 2016 and is set to lead FIFA until at least 2031.",
      "Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter\u2019s reputation likely always will be tied to leading FIFA during corruption crises that took down a swath of senior soccer officials worldwide.",
      "Platini, one of soccer\u2019s greatest players and later Blatter\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in soccer politics, never did get the FIFA presidency he often called his destiny.",
      "Neither Blatter nor Platini has worked in soccer since they were suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in October 2015. They were later banned and failed to overturn the bans in separate appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2016.",
      "\u201dThe criminal proceedings have had not only legal but also massive personal and professional consequences for Michel Platini, although no incriminating evidence was ever presented,\" Nellen said, suggesting further legal action \"against those responsible for the criminal proceedings.\u201d",
      "Platini\u2019s ban expired in 2019 and Blatter was given a subsequent ban by FIFA in 2021 months before his first was due to end.",
      "Blatter is exiled from soccer until late in 2028 \u2014 when he will be 92 \u2014 because of an ethics prosecution of alleged self-dealing in eight-figure management bonuses paid for successfully organizing the men\u2019s World Cup in 2010 and 2014.",
      "The verdict was given Tuesday in a low-key provincial courthouse where a four-day trial was held three weeks ago.",
      "Blatter and Platini have claimed at five different judicial bodies \u2014 twice at FIFA, then the Court of Arbitration for Sport and now two Swiss federal criminal courts \u2014 that they had a verbal \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to one day settle the unpaid and non-contracted salary.",
      "Platini was a storied former captain and coach of the France national term when he worked to help Blatter get elected to lead FIFA in Paris on the eve of the 1998 World Cup he organized.",
      "The two men said Platini agreed to be a presidential adviser on an annual salary of 300,000 Swiss francs (now $340,000) through 2002. They claim there was a verbal deal to later get the balance of 1 million Swiss francs for each year that FIFA could not pay at the time.",
      "Platini started asking for the money early in 2010, citing seven-figure payments made to senior Blatter aides who left FIFA which showed the soccer body could afford to pay him. The payment was finally made in February 2011.",
      "Details of the payment only emerged in the crisis that hit FIFA in May 2015 when U.S. federal investigators unsealed a sweeping investigation of international soccer officials. Swiss authorities made early-morning arrests at hotels in Zurich before seizing FIFA financial and business records.",
      "In 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors already were handling a criminal complaint filed by FIFA. That was about suspected financial wrongdoing linked to votes in December 2010 that picked Russia and Qatar as future World Cup hosts.",

    "story": [
      "Several new bars dedicated to women\u2019s sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing",
      "PHOENIX -- When you walk into Title 9 Sports Grill in Phoenix's Melrose District, its mission to be a haven for watching women's sports permeates every nook and cranny. From the over dozen TVs mounted on pink and orange walls to the \u201cPlay Like a Girl!\u201d neon sign against a giant image of retired WNBA star Diana Taurasi.",
      "It's an impressive turnaround for co-owners Audrey Corley and Kat Moore. Just before Christmas, the space was still Moore and her husband Brad's hot dog restaurant. But last summer they sold the business and the new owners didn't want to stay in the property. That's when Corley, who owns a popular lesbian bar on the next block, proposed partnering on the city's first women's sports-centric bar. She had been mulling the idea since reading about the Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, which opened in 2022, and then seeing a half-dozen similar bars emerge in the last year.",
      "\u201cThen I see, you know, another one popped up here and another one. And then I was like, it\u2019s just time. It has to be,\u201d Corley said before Title 9's grand opening earlier this month.",
      "Several new bars dedicated to women's sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing. From San Francisco to Cleveland, there will be more than a dozen across the country before the year is over. The femme-focused bar scene has made huge strides from three years ago when The Sports Bra was the only one. It comes during an exciting first year during which teams in the women's bracket will finally be paid for playing in the NCAA tourney. Many credit stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese for increasing the marketability of female players.",
      "Last season, Reese and Clark's teams never saw a dollar. Now, the women's teams will finally earn individual revenue, known as \u201cunits.\u201d A unit is money paid to conferences when one of its teams appears in the NCAA Tournament. Teams earn another with every game played.",
      "The most seamless part of transforming her old restaurant into Title 9 has been the built-in community anticipation of having a place to view women's sports, Moore said.",
      "\"The only question I\u2019ve gotten from quite a few men, especially when we first started telling people, was, \u2018Are men allowed?\u2019 Yeah!\u201d Moore said, with a chuckle.",
      "Named for the landmark 1972 law that forbids discrimination based on sex in education, including athletics, Title 9 is filled with tributes to female athletes, from framed photos with QR codes to a cocktail roster with drinks such as the Pat Summitt Sour and Taurasi Goat-Tail. However, the owners emphasize a family-friendly atmosphere where young girls can come celebrate after a school game.",
      "\u201cEven some of the little girls, they could come here and dream of being on the TV someday and actually getting paid for it,\u201d Corley said.",
      "Debra Hallum and Marlene du Plessis were also inspired by the Sports Bra. They made their targeted opening in Austin last week of 1972 ATX Women's Sports Pub across from the University of Texas campus. The day included a rainbow ribbon cutting and officials from the Austin LGBT Chamber of Commerce.",
      "While they are in a conservative state, the women have been emphasizing the bar\u2019s LGBTQ-friendliness.",
      "\u201cWe want to be very clear that we will be a very welcoming and inclusive space for all women sports fans,\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want to invite everyone to grow the interest and the viewership, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to fix that gap for women, including the pay gap.\u201d",
      "Neither woman has hospitality experience. Hallum has a corporate background and du Plessis' is in education. But, they researched running a business like this and hired a talented chef and staff. It's clear both are passionate.",
      "\u201cIt is so hard to find a bar or a pub that will show women\u2019s sports,\u201d du Plessis said. \u201cYou always have to call around, ask around to find where they going to show it. And then most of the time you know they will not have the sound on. And we will.\u201d",
      "They've been touched by the reactions from residents, even parents of boys.",
      "\u201cWe had a mom and dad, two daughters and their son show up and (the mom) was all about, 'This is exactly what we need,\u2019\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want our son to be raised knowing that this is just as great and just as wonderful as men\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "In Denver, Annie Weaver and Miranda Spencer met playing on opposing flag football teams. A month later, they began drafting a business plan for a similar concept, also inspired by The Sports Bra. Open since December, the 99ers Sports Bar is now hosting its first March Madness crowds.",
      "They were first mulling a name that would play off of Mia Hamm, the 1990s soccer icon who inspired Weaver\u2019s Halloween costume for years. They settled on a name that honors the 1999 U.S. Women's World Cup soccer team, filled with names and faces that didn't get as much attention as Hamm.",
      "On a recent Sunday, the bar was standing room only as the TVs aired an NWSL game, Unrivaled semifinal games, and the Selection Sunday broadcast announcing the brackets for the NCAA Tournament.",
      "The city doesn\u2019t even have any women\u2019s teams in the major national leagues, but it was recently awarded the 16th NWSL expansion team, to begin play in 2026.",
      "A tri-fold bracket covered one table, and an impromptu friendship bracelet-making station occupied another.",
      "\u201cI wish I would have had this space growing up,\u201d Spencer said.",
      "These new bar operators agree this is not a trend but an indicator of a market that hasn't been served. But hopefully, anyone looking to open a women's sports bar isn't doing it \u201cjust to be trendy,\u201d said Moore, of Title 9.",
      "Corley's most important advice for any would-be barkeep: \"The same way you play sports for the love, open this up for the love.\u201d",

The immediate approval under President Donald Trump serves as a far-different starting point for his government's relations with Qatar \u2014 particularly after he initially backed a four-nation boycott of Doha during his first term.",
      "\u201cThis proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,\u201d the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.",
      "Qatar's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear.",
      "The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them.",
      "Under terms of the sale, Qatar would purchase eight of the drones, as well as hundreds of bombs and missiles to arm the pilotless aircraft with and the equipment necessary to fly them by satellite.",
      "General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and have an endurance of more than 30 hours before needing to land.

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- The moon will appear to take bites out of the sun this weekend during a partial solar eclipse in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 but make sure to protect your eyes.",
      "The eclipse will be visible Saturday across Europe, western Africa, eastern North America and northern Asia. The sun will shrink the most for the northeastern United States, Greenland and eastern Canada.",
      "During a partial solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and Earth. The moon casts a shadow on Earth and only partly blocks the sun, making it appear like a crescent. Unlike a total solar eclipse, there's no totality so experts say proper eye protection must be worn the whole time.",
      "\u201cEclipses are just a game of light and shadow that are played by the sun, moon and Earth,\u201d said Auriane Egal with the Planetarium in Montr\u00e9al.",
      "Solar and lunar eclipses happen anywhere from four to seven times a year, according to NASA. Due to the moon's tilted orbit around Earth, they tend to come in pairs: a total lunar eclipse turned the moon red mid-March.",
      "To see the eclipse, look on astronomy websites to see when it begins in your area. The spectacle is slotted during sunrise for most of the Americas, late morning for western Europe and Africa and afternoon for eastern Europe and northern Asia.",
      "During the eclipse, the sun will slowly slim to a crescent as the moon appears to cover it and the day may get dimmer.",
      "\u201cIt will feel like a particularly cloudy day,\u201d said Juan Carlos Mu\u00f1oz-Mateos with the European Southern Observatory.",
      "Check weather conditions before heading outside. Clear skies away from tall buildings and city lights are best, especially in the Americas where the sun may be rising during the eclipse.",
      "Grab eclipse glasses ahead of time to spot the sight safely through a local science museum or ordering online from a seller cleared on the American Astronomical Society's website.",
      "Viewers can also enjoy the spectacle through indirect ways such as making a pinhole projector using household materials. Holding up a colander will produce a similar effect. Peering at the ground under a shady tree can yield crescent shadows as the sunlight filters through branches and leaves.",
      "Another total lunar eclipse and partial solar eclipse will return in September with the best solar eclipse views in Antarctica and New Zealand.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the quest for animal-to-human organ transplants \u2013 with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too.",
      "A Chinese patient is the third person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014 two pig hearts and two pig kidneys \u2013 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2013 an Alabama woman transplanted in November and a New Hampshire man transplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",
      "Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient \"is very well\u201d and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi\u2019an told reporters in a briefing this week.",
      "Wang, part of the hospital's xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.",
      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",
      "The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.",
      "\u201cWe do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,\u201d Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.",
      "In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of \u201cbridge\u201d support by externally attaching a pig liver to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.",
      "In China, Wang\u2019s team didn\u2019t remove the deceased person\u2019s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.",
      "That \u201cclouds the picture,\u201d said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn't involved with the work. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully a first step but it\u2019s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.\u201d",
      "Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome.",
      "According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it\u2019s unclear how that experiment turned out.",

      "Defense attorney Jose Baez urged an acquittal of his 32-year-old client, calling the proof \u201cincredibly flawed.\" He urged the jury to \u201clook at evidence, lack of evidence and the conflict of the evidence\u201d to exonerate Javice.",

      "Prosecutors said the Miami Beach, Florida, resident who appeared on the Forbes 2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list would have earned $45 million from the fraud.",
      "The defense presentation came after Chiuchiolo cited emails, text messages and phone calls to convince jurors that Javice repeatedly lied to JPMorgan in the summer of 2021 to secure a buyout that would earn her millions of dollars.",
      "The company Javice founded once seemed like a pioneer among businesses that cater to college-age students, who banks encourage to open checking or credit card accounts in the hopes they'll become lifelong customers.",
      "Frank, established in 2017 as TAPD Inc., was created to simplify filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a federal government form used by students to apply for financial aid for college or graduate school.",

Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",

The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",
      "If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations.",
      "Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency's interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed.",

Some of the influencers were registered dieticians.",

      "A team of about 150 restorers fuses scientific analysis and traditional techniques to clean, patch up and otherwise revive the more than 1.8 million relics in the collection of Beijing's Forbidden City",
      "BEIJING -- It's highly technical work in what looks more like a lab than a museum: A fragment of a glazed roof tile from Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City is analyzed in a state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction machine that produces images, which are then projected onto computer screens.",
      "The fragment being examined has a dark area on its surface that restorers want to understand. Their objective is to better preserve the artifacts at the sprawling imperial palace, the former home of China\u2019s emperors and its seat of power for hundreds of years.",
      "\u201cWe want to learn what the black material is,\" said Kang Baoqiang, one of the restorers at the complex, today a museum that attracts tourists from all over the world. \u201cWhether it\u2019s atmospheric sediment or the result of substantial change from within.\u201d",
      "About 150 workers on the team fuse scientific analysis and traditional techniques to clean, patch up and otherwise revive the more than 1.8 million relics in the museum's collection.",
      "They include scroll paintings, calligraphy, bronzes, ceramics \u2014 and, somewhat unexpectedly, ornate antique clocks that were gifted to emperors by early European visitors.",
      "Down the hall from the X-ray room, two other restorers patch up holes on a panel of patterned green silk with the Chinese character for \u201clongevity\u201d sewn into it, carefully adding color in a process called \u201cinpainting.\u201d",
      "The piece is believed to have been a birthday gift to Empress Dowager Cixi, the power behind the throne in the late 19th and early 20th century.",
      "Much of the work is laborious and monotonous \u2014 and takes months to complete.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the big dreams of protecting traditional cultural heritage that people talk about,\" said Wang Nan, one of the restorers. \"I simply enjoy the sense of achievement when an antique piece is fixed.\u201d",
      "Now a major tourist site in the heart of Beijing, the Forbidden City is the name that was given to the sprawling compound by foreigners in imperial times because entry was forbidden to most outsiders. It's formally known as the Palace Museum.",
      "Many of its treasures were hurriedly taken away during World War II to keep them from falling into the hands of the invading Japanese army. During a civil war that brought the Communist Party to power in 1949, the defeated Nationalists took many of the most prized pieces to Taiwan, where they are now housed in the National Palace Museum.",
      "Beijing's Palace Museum has since rebuilt its collection.",
      "Restoration techniques have also evolved, said Qu Feng, head of the museum\u2019s Conservation Department, though the old ways remain the foundation of the work.",
      "When we preserve an antique piece, we \u201cprotect the cultural values it carries,\u201d Qu said. \"And that is our ultimate goal.\u201d",

    "summary": "The White House on Wednesday continued to downplay and deflect criticism over a Signal group chat among top Trump administration officials.",
    "story": [
      "\"I take full responsibility,\" said National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "The White House is continuing to downplay and deflect criticism over a Signal group chat among top Trump administration officials in which plans for an airstrike on Yemen were discussed just before being executed.",
      "Democratic lawmakers are demanding an investigation and accusing key Trump defense and national security officials of revealing classified information about the Yemen plans in the March 15 group chat over an encrypted but unsecured app. The chat also included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, who was inadvertently invited to the channel.",
      "The fallout continued to grow Wednesday as The Atlantic, which broke the story on Monday, published purported details discussed in the chat on the Yemen strike. In the new article, the magazine shared text messages sent to the group, including its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth giving a \"TEAM UPDATE\" on pending times of the strike, \"favorable\" weather conditions in Yemen and that F-18 military jets and attack drones would carry out two strike packages.",
      "\"THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP,\" Hegseth texted at one point, noting the military time of 1415 (2:15 p.m.) for the planned strike.",
      "The magazine described Hegseth's text message as \"war plans.\"",
      "The magazine reported that Hegseth's text message was sent to the group, unwittingly including Goldberg's cellphone number, \"31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched\" against militant Houthi targets.",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee, would not be classified. Y'all know it was a lie. That's ridiculous,\" Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said during a House Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday as he grilled Trump officials who were on the Signal chat. \"I've seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification.\"",
      "Here is what Trump administration officials have said about the contents of the group chat:",
      "The White House and the top administration officials who were on the group chat titled \"Houthi PC small group\" continued to say Wednesday that no classified information was shared in the group chat.",
      "\"The conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the President and national security advisor stated, no classified information was shared. There were no sources, methods, locations, or war plans that were shared,\" Trump's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said at Wednesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing. \"This was a standard update to the national security cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region.\"",
      "While testifying at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, Gabbard initially declined to answer questions about the group chat, even declining to confirm if she was part of it, saying, \"I'm not going to get into specifics because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.\"",
      "But later in the hearing, Gabbard told the Senate committee members, \"There was no classified material that was shared in the Signal chat.\"",
      "Seated next to Gabbard on Tuesday, CIA Director John Radcliffe immediately confirmed that he was part of the group chat when asked.",
      "\"So, my communications, to be clear, in a Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information, to be clear,\" Radcliffe said.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., asked both Gabbard and Radcliffe to answer a series of questions about the contents of the group chat, including whether military units, weapons and timing were mentioned.",
      "Both Gabbard and Radcliffe answered that they could not recall if those subjects came up. When pressed by Kelly, Gabbard later said, \"I believe there was a discussion around targets in general,\" and Radcliffe added, \"I think that's consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "In a social media post on X Wednesday, Hegseth slammed The Atlantic's reporting, saying, \"The Atlantic released so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information.\"",
      "In an interview Tuesday night on \"The VINCE Show\" -- a conservative talk radio program hosted by Vince Coglianese -- Trump highlighted the success of the Yemen attack and said, \"No, and there weren't details, and there was nothing in there that was compromised, and it had no impact on the attack, which was very successful.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X Wednesday, noting that The Atlantic's headline on its follow-up article referred to \"attack plans\" instead of \"war plans\" the magazine initially reported.",
      "\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,'\" Leavitt wrote in her post. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well known for his sensationalist spin.\"",
      "Goldberg and The Atlantic reported that they \"held back specific information related to weapons and to the timing of the attacks that we found in certain texts.\" But The Atlantic said it decided to release Hegseth's text messages stating the types of weapons used and the timing of the strike to counter claims from Trump officials that no classified information was released in what it described in the article as \"a massive Trump-administration security breach.\"",
      "\"The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump -- combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts -- have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions,\" the magazine's follow-up article reads.",
      "In his testimony Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ratcliffe said Signal was appropriately used by the group involved in the chat, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\"So that we\u2019re clear, one of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA Director was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA, as it is for most CIA officers,\" Ratcliffe said as he responded to questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \"One of the things that I was briefed on very early Senator was by the CIA Records Management folks about the use of Signal as a permissible work use. It is. That is a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration.\"",
      "Ratcliffe added, \u201cIt is an end-to-end encryption. It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided\u2026provided Senator that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels. So those were procedures that were implemented. My staff implemented those processes, followed those processes, complied with those processes.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Ratcliffe told the House Intelligence Committee that there was no misuse of the Signal app.",
      "\"I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \"And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success.\"",
      "But several former defense and intelligence officials told ABC News that such exchanges should have never been made in such a group chat. They insisted that an exact location of a strike isn't needed for information to be damaging to national security.",
      "The details Hegseth shared in the chat were so sensitive that if leaked, they could have put troops carrying out the strike in danger because it gives the adversary time to prepare to fight back, the experts told ABC News.",
      "\"It was 100 percent classified,\" Darrell Blocker, a former CIA field operative and ABC News contributor, said of the reported text exchange, based on his three decades with a security clearance.",
      "Gabbard told the House Committee, \"The Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices. December of 2024, CISA [Certified Information Systems Auditor] stated, 'We strongly urge highly targeted individuals to immediately review and apply best practices provided in the guidance to protect mobile communications, including consistent use of end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.'\"",
      "On Tuesday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he didn't know anything about Signal and wasn't involved in the group chat.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" Trump said. \"A lot of the military, I think, successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Trump suggested that a staff member of national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently invited Goldberg to the group chat.",
      "\"And what it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that was with Mike Waltz, worked for Mike Waltz at a lower level had, I guess Goldberg's number were called through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call,\" Trump said in an interview with Newsmax.",
      "But during an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham Tuesday night, Waltz contradicted Trump's statement, saying he was the one who accidentally invited Goldberg to the chat.",
      "\u201cWell, look, a staffer wasn't responsible. And look, I take full responsibility. I built the group,\" Waltz said, adding that the incident was \"embarrassing.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Gabbard told the House Intelligence Committee that it was \"a mistake\" to add Goldberg to the chat.",
      "During a news conference in Kingston, Jamaica, on Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he, too, was on the Signal chat and added, \"Someone made a big mistake and added a journalist.\"",
      "Elon Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are reviewing how Goldberg was added to a Signal chat, a senior White House official told ABC News.",
      "In his interview with Fox News Tuesday night, Waltz alluded to Musk's involvement, saying, \"I just talked to Elon on the way here -- we have the best technical minds looking at how this happened.\"",
      "The White House official confirmed to ABC News that DOGE is involved and that the team is working with other teams to make communications \"more secure and efficient.\"",
      "Leavitt said on FOX News that in addition to Musk and his team, the National Security Council \"is all digging into this matter... to ensure this could never happen again.\"",
      "Asked by Sen. Warner during Tuesday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing whether the FBI was investigating the matter, FBI Director Kash Patel, who was not part of the chat, said, \"Senator, I was just briefed about it late last night and this morning. I don't have an update.\"",

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order behind closed doors on Thursday directing federal agencies and the Smithsonian to eliminate what the order calls \"divisive\" and \"anti-American\" content from museums and national parks, sources familiar with the order told ABC News.",
      "The order -- called \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\" -- directed the vice president and the secretary of Interior to restore federal parks, monuments, memorials and statues \"that have been improperly removed or changed in the last five years to perpetuate a false revision of history or improperly minimize or disparage certain historical figures or events.\"",
      "The order also directed Vice President JD Vance, who is a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, to work to eliminate what it claims are improper, divisive or anti-American ideology from the Smithsonian -- an institution consisting of 21 museums and 14 education and research centers -- as well as the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.",
      "The White House said in the full text of the executive order that over the past decade, a rewriting of history has cast American milestones in a \"negative light\" and therefore directs museums to remove some historical context relating to race and gender.",
      "It added that future funds for the organization will be banned for exhibits or programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law.\"",
      "Furthermore, it banned the forthcoming American Women's History Museum from recognizing transgender women \"in any respect.\"",
      "The order said that the exhibits and programs that it seeks to remove undermine the nation's \"unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness\" by casting its success \"as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.\"",
      "Examples given by the order include an exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum called \"The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,\" which the order claimed \"promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct\" and exhibits at the National Museum of African American History and Culture that the order said \"proclaimed that 'hard work,' 'individualism,' and 'the nuclear family' are aspects of 'White culture.'\"",

      "\"It certainly raises the specter of that kind of interference and corruption,\" Slaughter said. \"We won't know without the presence of minority commissioners at the FTC why it's taking the actions it's taking and whether they're in line with the law.\"",
      "Bedoya added, \"Some of the recent, I would say, chaotic moves from the White House are a real concern, not just for consumers, but also for the market. If you want small businesses and startups to succeed, you want a stable, predictable market where big companies can't just snuff you out, not by issuing a better product, but just throwing their weight around to stop you. That is the kind of work FTC does, and that's what I fear will go away.\"",

The American group was originally planning to visit the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race.",
      "Trump showed no indication of softening his ambition to take control of the island, which is an autonomous territory but part of the Kingdom of Denmark.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and international security,\" Trump said, taking reporters' questions in the Oval Office.",
      "\"So we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go,\" he continued. \"We need Greenland. And the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark. Denmark has to have us have Greenland.

      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients",
      "CHICAGO -- A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients.",
      "Judge Matthew Kennelly of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois halted the Labor Department from requiring federal contractors or grant recipients from certifying that they don't operate any programs in violation of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders.",
      "That certification provision has stepped up pressure on companies and other organizations to revisit their DEI practices because if the government were to determine they violated the provision, they would be subject to crippling financial penalties under the False Claims Act.",
      "Thursday's ruling is in response to a lawsuit filed by Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit founded in 1981 that helps prepare women for work in skilled construction trades and has several contracts with the Department of Labor. There was no immediate reaction from Chicago Women in Trades to Kennelly's order. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "A hearing on Chicago Women in Trades' bid for a longer-lasting halt on Trump's anti-DEI executive orders is scheduled for April 10.",
      "The organization's lawsuit is one of several challenging Trump's executive orders targeting DEI programs in both the private and public sectors.",
      "Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order that included a requirement that federal contractors and grantees certify that they don't \u201coperate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\u201d",
      "Kennelly\u2019s decision comes nearly two weeks after an appeals court lifted a broader nationwide injunction against Trump\u2019s anti-DEI executive orders in a separate lawsuit in Baltimore. But Thursday\u2019s ruling is limited in scope because Kennelly declined to extend the temporary restraining order to other federal agencies.",
      "Chicago Women in Trades, which filed its case against the Trump administration last month, argued that the president's executive orders on DEI are so broad and vague that the organization had no way to ensure compliance, and thus they threaten its core mission.",
      "Kennelly wrote that Chicago Women in Trades, which is being represented by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was likely to succeed in its arguments that parts of the executive orders are a violation of free speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague.",
      "Although the government argued that the certification provision \u201cimplicates only illegal DEI programs, it has studiously declined to shed any light on what this means. The answer is anything but obvious,\u201d Kennelly wrote.",
      "Kennelly wrote that he extended his order to all Labor Department contractors and grant recipients because the vagueness of Trump's executive orders, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, would likely pressure organizations to curb DEI programs in potential violation of free speech rights.",
      "Rather than face potentially crippling penalties, \u201cit is likely that many of these grantees will take the safer route and choose to simply stop speaking on anything remotely related to what the government might consider to promote DEI or equity. A nationwide restraining order is appropriate to protect grantees who cannot afford the risks inherent in biting the hand that feeds them,\" Kennelly wrote.",
      "The judge also blocked the DOL from freezing or canceling any funding with Chicago Women in Trades, and the Trump administration from pursuing any False Claims Act enforcement against them.",
      "During a hearing on Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Chicago Women in Trades' motion for relief was premature because its arguments rely on speculation as to how the executive orders will be implemented.",
      "But Chicago Women in Trades noted in court filings that it has multiple communications from the Department of Labor directing them to ensure compliance with both DEI executive orders. The organization also said in court and has already lost a subcontract with a contractor trying to comply with the executive order.",
      "Chicago Women in Trades has a long history of partnering with companies, state and federal agencies and other industry stakeholders to provide guidance and training on best practices for recruiting and retaining women in the trades \u2014 including training to combat bias and harassment that is prevalent in one of the country\u2019s most male-dominated industries.",
      "Its grant work with the federal government dates back years, including two grants awarded under the first Trump administration under the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations, which aims to expand pathways for women seeking to enter skilled trades.",

      "The Trump administration is under scrutiny after The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg said he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat that included top national security officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which the officials discussed plans for a U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen.",
      "Goldberg revealed the mishap in a piece for the magazine on Monday and told ABC News that he was apparently added to the chat by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "Goldberg provided two screenshots in the magazine piece and did not provide details or quotes, only a description of the operational part of the Signal message chain.",
      "Both the Trump administration and top officials involved have repeatedly denied that war plans or classified information were discussed, as Goldberg reported.",
      "Below is a timeline spanning from the creation of the group chat to what has happened since.",
      "In an interview with \"ABC News Live\" Monday evening, Goldberg told Linsey Davis he received a message request on the Signal app from White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, or someone \"who's purporting to be Mike Waltz\" on March 11.",
      "He said the invitation was \"not an unusual thing in Washington.\"",
      "\"I'm a journalist, I've met him in the past, so I accept it,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Goldberg said he accepted the request, with nothing occurring until several days later, when he was added to a \"group of seemingly very high national security officials of the United States\" including Vice President JD Vance, with Waltz apparently creating this chat.",
      "\"Mike Waltz puts this group together and says it's a planning group for essentially upcoming action in Yemen,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he initially thought it was a hoax since it would be \"completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News a \"long conversation\" occurred between the group chat members on March 14, discussing \"whether or not they should or shouldn't take action in Yemen.\"",
      "The messages went back and forth with \"a lot of resentment directed at European allies of the United States, which obviously enhanced the credibility of this chain,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He told ABC News at this point the members of the chat sounded like people he knew within the administration, but was still not sure whether or not it was a hoax.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he continued to track the incoming messages from the group chat, to see \"who was trying to entrap me or trick me.\" Then on March 15, he said it became \"overwhelmingly clear\" it was a legitimate group chat, he told ABC News.",
      "At 11:44 a.m., he said he received a text in the chain from someone claiming to be Hegseth, or \"somebody identified as Pete,\" providing what Goldberg characterized as a war plan. The message included a \"sequencing of events related to an upcoming attack on Yemen\" and promised results by 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he was in his car and waiting with his phone to \"see if this was a real thing.\"",
      "\"Sure enough, around 1:50 [p.m.] Eastern time, I see that Yemen is under attack,\" he said.",
      "When the attacks seemed to be \"going well,\" Goldberg told ABC News that members of the chat began sending congratulatory messages along with fist, fire and American flag emojis.",
      "\"That was the day I realized this is possibly unbelievably the leaders of the United States discussing this on my messaging app,\" Goldberg told ABC News. \"My reaction was, I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he removed himself from the group chat once the operation was completed.",
      "\"I watched this Yemen operation go from beginning to apparent end, and that was enough for me to learn that there's something wrong in the system here that would allow this information to come so dangerously close to the open wild,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waltz appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" the day after the strikes on Yemen and said the U.S. airstrikes \"took out\" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, which he said differed from the Biden administration's launches against the group.",
      "\"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth \u2014 what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" Waltz said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Goldberg published a story in The Atlantic revealing the mishap, in a piece titled \"The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.\"",
      "Shortly after the story's publication on Monday afternoon, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes shared with ABC News the statement he provided to The Atlantic confirming the authenticity of the Signal group chat.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Hegseth denied he sent war plans in the chat.",
      "\"I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth told reporters in Honolulu while on a layover on his trip to Asia.",
      "Hegseth called Goldberg a \"deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.\"",
      "\"This is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does,\" Hegseth said about Goldberg.",
      "During an event at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump was asked about Goldberg's article. \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic,\" he said.",
      "Top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries voiced outrage at the administration after this mishap.",
      "\"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,\" Jeffries said in a statement on Monday.",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who faced scrutiny over her alleged use of a private email server while at the State Department, shared her reaction to the Signal group chat on X: \"You have got to be kidding me.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also criticized this apparent breach of military intelligence, urging Senate Republicans to work with Democrats in a \"full investigation\" to look into how this incident occurred.",
      "\"If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, referencing the scandal over Clinton's emails.",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Goldberg is \"well-known for his sensationalist spin\" and emphasized that \"no 'war plans' were discussed.\"",
      "\"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread. Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,\" Leavitt shared on X.",
      "Trump told NBC News he remains confident in Waltz even after the use of an unsecured group chat.",
      "\"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,\" Trump told NBC correspondent Garrett Haake.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Tuesday regarding the mishap. Both officials said while testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence there was no classified information on the chain.",
      "Ratcliffe said he believed the \"national security adviser intended this to be as it should have been, a mechanism for coordinating between senior level officials, but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications for anything that would be classified.\"",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson continued to downplay the mishap but admitted the breach was a \"serious\" mistake on Tuesday.",
      "\"Look, they have acknowledged that there is an error, and they are correcting it. And I would've asked the same thing of the Biden administration,\" Johnson said during a news conference Tuesday morning.",
      "During a White House meeting with ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said this incident is \"just something that can happen\" and that there was \"no classified information\" in the group chat.",
      "He added that Signal is \"not a perfect technology.\"",
      "\"Sometimes somebody can get onto those things,\" Trump said. \"That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.\"",
      "Waltz said the White House's tech and legal teams are looking into the mishap.",
      "\"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger,\" Waltz said.",
      "He also claimed to have never met Goldberg.",
      "\"We are looking into him, reviewing how the heck he got into this room,\" Waltz said.",
      "A spokesperson for The Atlantic released a statement on Tuesday night following the comments from Trump and his aides.",
      "\"Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and other in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans,\" the magazine said.",
      "The statement went on to say that \"any responsible national security expert would consider the information contained in this Signal chat to be of the greatest sensitivity, and would agree that this information should never be shared on non-government messaging apps.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, Waltz said he was the one responsible for what took place.",
      "\"I take full responsibility. I built the group,\" Waltz told Fox News' Laura Ingraham.",
      "At the same time, Waltz tried to flip the script and blame Goldberg \u2014 suggesting the editor could have somehow wormed his way in to the group chat.",
      "\"Of course, I didn't see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else. Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean, is something we're trying to figure out,\" Waltz said, without evidence, on Fox News.",
      "Schumer and other top Senate Democrats on national security committees wrote a letter to Trump seeking more information about the mishap, requesting a \"complete and unredacted\" transcript of the Signal group chat for the appropriate committees to review in a secure setting.",
      "\"We write to you with extreme alarm about the astonishingly poor judgment shown by your Cabinet and national security advisors,\" the Senators wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ABC News. \"You have long advocated for accountability and transparency in the government, particularly as it relates to the handling of classified information, national security and the safety of American servicemembers. As such, it is imperative that you address this breach with the seriousness and diligence that it demands.\"",
      "The Atlantic on Wednesday published a new article detailing purported information about recent American strikes in Yemen it says was accidentally shared in the Signal group chat.",
      "The article suggested that Hegseth updated members of the \"Houthi PC small group\" Signal chat on \"favorable\" weather conditions ahead of planned airstrikes on Houthi leaders and other targets in Yemen.",
      "The article said Hegseth also notified the group of a planned timeline for flights of F-18 strike aircraft, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched for the mission.",
      "Shortly after the article was published, Leavitt said in a post on X \"these were NOT 'war plans.'\"",
      "\"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\" the White House press secretary said.",
      "Waltz said Wednesday morning that the chat didn't include war plans or specific details about the strike.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests,\" Waltz posted on X.",
      "Also on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg was assigned to a federal lawsuit against five Cabinet members over the administration's use of Signal. Boasberg is also handling the case against the Trump administration over its deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The lawsuit \u2014 which names Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the National Archives as defendants \u2014 asked a federal judge to declare the use of Signal unlawful and order the cabinet members to preserve the records immediately.",
      "\"Nobody's texting war plans,\" Hegseth said on Wednesday. \"I noticed this morning out came something that doesn't look like war plans. And as a matter of fact, they even changed the title to attack plans because they know it's not war plans.\"",
      "\"It's very clear Goldberg oversold what he had,\" Vance posted to X.",
      "Goldberg, during an interview with ABC News Live anchor Kyra Phillips, responded to the administration pushback.",
      "\"They have decided obviously, instead of simply saying, 'Yeah we had a security breach and we're going to try to plug that breach and do better next time,' they've decided to blame the guy who they invited into the conversation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "On Thursday, Judge Boasberg ordered the top cabinet officials named in a lawsuit by the government transparency group American Oversight to retain any messages sent and received over Signal between March 11 and March 15.",
      "Benjamin Sparks, a lawyer representing American Oversight, raised concerns that the messages are in \"imminent danger of destruction\" due to settings within Signal that can be set to delete messages automatically \u2014 prompting Boasberg to order the Trump administration to file a sworn declaration by this Monday to ensure the messages are preserved.",
      "The judge declined, for now, to order administration officials to disclose if Signal had been used by the Trump administration in a wider context.",

      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote in the chat, according to Goldberg. \"There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",

There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.\"",
      "Ultimately, he supported the attack, telling Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, \u201cif you think we should do it let\u2019s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,\u201d according to Goldberg's account.",
      "The White House has insisted the communications in the group chat were not war plans and criticized The Atlantic journalist who detailed the account.",
      "\"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X on Wednesday.",
      "William Martin, Vance's communications director, said the vice president and Trump \"are in complete agreement.\"",
      "\u201cThe Vice President\u2019s first priority is always making sure that the President\u2019s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations. Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration\u2019s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Asked if Vance and Trump had spoken between the time Vance raised his concerns with the group, as reported by The Atlantic, and he concurred with those advocating to go ahead with the strike, a spokesperson for Vance said the statement Martin provided to ABC News made it clear that they did, pointing out the line that they had \u201csubsequent conversations about this matter.\u201d",
      "The comments from Vance are striking, given that he has been in lockstep, at least in public, with Trump, his top defender most of the time since being chosen as his running mate last July.",
      "No situation depicted that more than Trump and Vance's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month, where the three men got into a shouting match in front of the media over the prospects of a ceasefire deal to end the war in Ukraine. Vance berated Zelenskyy for not being thankful for the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine.",
      "\"Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,\" Vance said to Zelenskyy. \"Right now, you guys are going around enforcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\"",
      "During the campaign cycle, where Vance was the policy attack dog for the president and previously said that Trump needs a vice president who wouldn't \"stab\" him in the back, there was only a handful of times he deviated from Trump on policy, with the most notable incident occurring in an NBC interview during the presidential campaign when he said Trump would veto a national abortion ban. A few weeks later, Trump, during his debate with Kamala Harris hosted by ABC News, was asked about Vance's comments on an abortion ban.",
      "\"Well, I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,\" Trump said.",
      "Since then, Vance has been more careful not to deviate publicly from the president's policy position.",
      "Following their victory in November, a source close to Vance told ABC News that the vice president was tasked to ensure that all of the priorities of the Trump administration move forward and would work on any of the issues Trump needs him to further.",
      "In November, a source familiar with Vance and Trump's relationship said Vance was focused on doing whatever was needed to support the president-elect and the administration.",

    "story": [
      "The Signal chat story is the latest one Goldberg has done on President Trump.",
      "The fallout from the purported Signal group chat between top national security officials that inadvertently included a journalist is the latest chapter between President Donald Trump and The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who once reported that Trump referred to fallen military members as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"",
      "\"He is as you know is a sleazebag, but at the highest level. His magazine is failing,\" Trump said of Goldberg on Wednesday during an appearance on the \"VINCE Show\" podcast.",
      "Before coming to The Atlantic, Goldberg has done reporting for several news outlets, including the Washington Post, the Forward and the New Yorker, covering the Middle East, Washington politics and other topics.",
      "He joined the staff of The Atlantic in 2007 and became its editor-in-chief nine years later. Over the last several years, he has written articles on the inner workings of the first Trump administration.",
      "It was under his leadership that The Atlantic published its third presidential endorsement in the magazine's 168-year history when it backed then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Trump in the 2016 election.",
      "The endorsement called then-candidate Trump \"the most ostentatiously unqualified major-party candidate in the 227-year history of the American presidency,\" and said, \"He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.\"",
      "A few weeks after the endorsement, Goldberg criticized Trump's rhetoric during the campaign in an interview with NPR.",
      "\"At the very least, he traffics in racial invective knowingly. To me, that's a threshold question. If you do that and if you know what you're doing then, yes, you're a racist. I think he's a racist,\" he said in the interview.",
      "Trump has attacked Goldberg and the magazine over the endorsement for years, claiming it was a failing publication.",
      "A month before the 2020 election, Goldberg wrote an article in The Atlantic that described an 2018 incident where Trump refused to visit an American cemetery in France where World War I service members were buried.",
      "\"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers,\" Trump told his advisers, according to the article. It also said Trump called fallen Marines \"suckers.\"",
      "The president denied he had used those terms on what was then Twitter and went after Goldberg's sources. John Kelly, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, later confirmed Goldberg's account in an interview with CNN.",
      "\"This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election,\" he tweeted.",
      "The editor has remained critical of Trump's policies, rhetoric and actions.",
      "In 2023, months after Trump announced he was running for reelection, the magazine ran an entire issue dedicated to analyzing what a second Trump term would look and said it was no different than authoritarian regimes.",
      "Trump called out Goldberg by name two weeks before the 2024 election after he wrote a piece about Trump's relationship with the military during his first term. Goldberg wrote that former Trump officials told him that Trump was obsessed with dictators and said he needed \"the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" citing two people who heard the private conversation.",
      "Then-Trump spokesman Alex Pfeiffer said the anecdote was \"absolutely false. President Trump never said this.\u201d",
      "White House Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt echoed the president's attacks on Goldberg during a press briefing Wednesday claiming that the editor has spent years trying to discredit the president while ignoring Trump's successes.",
      "\"No one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg,\" she told reporters.",
      "Goldberg defended his reporting during an interview with ABC News Live on Wednesday.",
      "\"They've decided to blame the guy who they invited into the conversation. It's a little bit strange behavior,\" he said. \"Honestly I don't know why they're acting like this except to think that they're they know how serious a national security breach it is. And so they have to deflect it and push it on to the guy, again, they invited into the chat -- namely me.\"",

      "ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence, even as they push forward other parts of a school safety bill aimed at preventing a school shooting like the one in September at Apalachee High School.",
      "House and Senate lawmakers unveiled a compromise version of House Bill 268 on Thursday, which then passed the Senate Judiciary committee unanimously. That sets it up for final passage in the closing days of Georgia's 2025 legislative session.",
      "The push to share information was driven by the belief among many that the Barrow County school system didn\u2019t have a full picture of the warning signs displayed by the 14-year-old accused in the fatal shootings of two students and two teachers. But there was loud opposition from both Democratic and Republican constituencies that the database would create a permanent blacklist with no due process that could treat racial and religious minorities unfairly.",
      "\u201cThe reason it wasn\u2019t going to fly was pushback from all points of the political spectrum that worried about their child being stigmatized just for an accusation or an uncorroborated complaint,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican representing parts of Barrow County.",
      "The compromise version also removed a requirement that all school systems set up formal threat management teams to evaluate whether students may commit violence. That approach is strongly recommended by many national experts, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency already offers training. House Education Committee Chairman Chris Erwin, a Republican from Homer, said he was hopeful schools would voluntarily adopt the model.",
      "\u201cI think there is a knowledge out there of the importance of planning and preparing already in schools,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSo having a full model structure for the state isn\u2019t as important as maybe we once thought it was.\u201d",
      "The measure would still require police agencies to report to schools when officers learn that a child has threatened death or injury to someone at a school. But those reports aren't mandated to become part of a student's educational record and wouldn't travel with a student if they transfer to another district.",
      "That raises questions about whether the bill addresses one of the key criticisms that followed the Apalachee shooting. School officials never became aware that a sheriff's deputy in Jackson County had interviewed Colt Gray in May 2023 after the FBI passed along a tip that Gray might have posted a shooting threat online. That report would have been forwarded to middle school officials in Jackson County under the bill, but wouldn't have followed Gray when he enrolled as a freshman in nearby Barrow County after skipping eighth grade entirely.",
      "The bill also mandates quicker transfers of records when a student enters a new school, creates at least one new position to help coordinate mental health treatment for students in each of Georgia\u2019s 180 school districts and sets up an anonymous reporting system statewide.",
      "Lawmakers on Thursday added in features of separate Senate bills that had passed. They would mandate that all Georgia public schools provide wearable panic buttons to employees. Public schools would also be required to submit electronic maps of their campuses to local, state and federal agencies once a year.",
      "The amended bill would also make adult prosecution the default when children aged 13 to 16 are charged with terroristic acts at school, any aggravated assault with a gun, or attempted murder. The Senate had originally proposed a broader range of crimes when adult prosecution would be the default. House leaders had said they didn't want to submit any more juveniles to adult prosecution.",

She also helped other inmates to file petitions.",

      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients",
      "CHICAGO -- A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients.",
      "Judge Matthew Kennelly of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois halted the Labor Department from requiring federal contractors or grant recipients from certifying that they don't operate any programs in violation of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders.",
      "That certification provision has stepped up pressure on companies and other organizations to revisit their DEI practices because if the government were to determine they violated the provision, they would be subject to crippling financial penalties under the False Claims Act.",
      "Thursday's ruling is in response to a lawsuit filed by Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit founded in 1981 that helps prepare women for work in skilled construction trades and has several contracts with the Department of Labor. There was no immediate reaction from Chicago Women in Trades to Kennelly's order. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "A hearing on Chicago Women in Trades' bid for a longer-lasting halt on Trump's anti-DEI executive orders is scheduled for April 10.",
      "The organization's lawsuit is one of several challenging Trump's executive orders targeting DEI programs in both the private and public sectors.",
      "Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order that included a requirement that federal contractors and grantees certify that they don't \u201coperate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\u201d",
      "Kennelly\u2019s decision comes nearly two weeks after an appeals court lifted a broader nationwide injunction against Trump\u2019s anti-DEI executive orders in a separate lawsuit in Baltimore. But Thursday\u2019s ruling is limited in scope because Kennelly declined to extend the temporary restraining order to other federal agencies.",
      "Chicago Women in Trades, which filed its case against the Trump administration last month, argued that the president's executive orders on DEI are so broad and vague that the organization had no way to ensure compliance, and thus they threaten its core mission.",
      "Kennelly wrote that Chicago Women in Trades, which is being represented by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was likely to succeed in its arguments that parts of the executive orders are a violation of free speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague.",
      "Although the government argued that the certification provision \u201cimplicates only illegal DEI programs, it has studiously declined to shed any light on what this means. The answer is anything but obvious,\u201d Kennelly wrote.",
      "Kennelly wrote that he extended his order to all Labor Department contractors and grant recipients because the vagueness of Trump's executive orders, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, would likely pressure organizations to curb DEI programs in potential violation of free speech rights.",
      "Rather than face potentially crippling penalties, \u201cit is likely that many of these grantees will take the safer route and choose to simply stop speaking on anything remotely related to what the government might consider to promote DEI or equity. A nationwide restraining order is appropriate to protect grantees who cannot afford the risks inherent in biting the hand that feeds them,\" Kennelly wrote.",
      "The judge also blocked the DOL from freezing or canceling any funding with Chicago Women in Trades, and the Trump administration from pursuing any False Claims Act enforcement against them.",
      "During a hearing on Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Chicago Women in Trades' motion for relief was premature because its arguments rely on speculation as to how the executive orders will be implemented.",
      "But Chicago Women in Trades noted in court filings that it has multiple communications from the Department of Labor directing them to ensure compliance with both DEI executive orders. The organization also said in court and has already lost a subcontract with a contractor trying to comply with the executive order.",
      "Chicago Women in Trades has a long history of partnering with companies, state and federal agencies and other industry stakeholders to provide guidance and training on best practices for recruiting and retaining women in the trades \u2014 including training to combat bias and harassment that is prevalent in one of the country\u2019s most male-dominated industries.",

      "The family of a 69-year-old man who died in a rural Colorado jail in 2023 says he slowly suffocated to death after his ribs were broken during an altercation with a deputy and he languished in a cell for a week without medical care",
      "DENVER -- A 69-year-old man slowly suffocated to death in a rural Colorado jail after his ribs were broken during an altercation with a deputy and he languished in a cell for a week without medical care, according to a lawsuit announced by the man\u2019s family Thursday.",
      "The 2023 death of Michael Burch was ruled a homicide. Following a state investigation, prosecutors decided not to bring criminal charges against the deputy who used a Taser on Burch and wrestled with him in a Huerfano County jail cell. District Attorney Henry Solano noted there was \u201csufficient information\u201d that the deputy could say he acted in self-defense.",
      "An autopsy report found six of Burch\u2019s right ribs had broken and his right lung collapsed after the altercation with the deputy. He wasn\u2019t taken to a hospital but instead was transferred to another cell where he was found dead seven days later.",
      "\u201cThe simple act of breathing became so painful as Mr. Burch\u2019s shattered ribs continued to pierce and tear through his organs that his body stopped using his right lung, which shrank to half the normal size,\u201d lawyers for Burch's estate said in the federal lawsuit.",
      "It named as defendants the Huerfano County commissioners, sheriff\u2019s office, individual sheriff\u2019s officials, paramedics and the hospital they worked for as well as nurses and the nonprofit company contracted to provide health care to jail inmates.",
      "The lawsuit accuses them of causing Burch\u2019s fatal injuries and not doing anything to treat them, violating his constitutional rights.",
      "A lawyer representing the county and sheriff's office, Eric Ziporin, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Spanish Peaks Regional Health Center, Stacy Cristelli, said the hospital could not comment because of patient privacy but would defend itself in court.",
      "Lawyers for Burch\u2019s family from the firm Rathod Mohamedbhai said they were not aware of anyone being disciplined or fired in connection with Burch's death.",
      "Burch was tackled after he refused to drop a pencil he had been given to take notes in the cell. A deputy had warned him \u201cDrop it or we\u2019ll drop you\u201d, according to body camera footage. Once the Taser was used, Burch began to charge at the deputy and the video, which becomes obscured, shows him going to the ground near a steel bench in the cell and his arms being held by the deputy. The lawsuit says Burch was tackled into the bench, which it says broke his ribs.",
      "Burch, a former California prison guard, was arrested on March 25, 2023, after a series of erratic acts, including driving up to the home of two strangers and swinging a rubber mallet around, that the lawsuit claims was caused by his deteriorating mental health.",
      "Burch's mental health was not evaluated when he arrived at the jail, the lawsuit claims, although video captured another sheriff's official signaling he was crazy by stirring her finger next to her head after he was hit with the Taser and tackled on March 28, 2023.",
      "The inmate screamed and moaned as the deputy then used a knee to keep Burch on the ground when he was accused of resisting. Later he appeared calmer when he was evaluated by paramedics. He told them that his ribs had been crushed and said he wanted to go to the hospital but the paramedics did not evaluate his chest, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Body camera footage shows one paramedic saying he was going to check out his right side but it was not clear from the footage what he did.",
      "Burch was not taken to the hospital, the lawsuit said, but moved to a neighboring cell, where the blurry window in the door was temporarily covered by plastic that said \u201cwarning security and safety zone\u201d, which was also captured on video.",
      "After Burch told a sheriff's captain that he barely survived the night on April 1, 2023, he was seen over video by a contracted nurse in Mississippi but she did not ask to see Burch's chest, the lawsuit said, instead focusing her attention on his mental health.",
      "Three days later, Burch was found dead on the concrete floor of his cell.",

    "story": [
      "Congress is holding a hearing Thursday about the January collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter that killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft",
      "Congress will hold a hearing Thursday morning about what we know so far about the deadly midair collision above the nation's capital that killed 67 people in January and what might have caused it.",
      "The head of the National Transportation Safety Board that is investigating the crash will appear along with the leaders of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army's aviation division to answer questions in the Senate.",
      "There will almost certainly be questions about the 85 dangerous close calls between planes and helicopters near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport that the NTSB identified in the three years before the crash and why officials didn't do something about them. Lawmakers on the Commerce Committee that oversees aviation have also questioned why the Army routinely operated helicopters through the area with a key safety system that is supposed to notify other aircraft and the tower about their location turned off.",
      "Both of the top ranking members of the committee \u2014 Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell \u2014 have sent letters demanding answers from the Army about how often and why their Black Hawks have operated in around Washington D.C. without transmitting location data.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said earlier this month that the close proximity of planes and helicopters in Washington, D.C., represented an \u201cintolerable risk to aviation safety\u201d that the FAA should have spotted sooner.",
      "Homendy said Wednesday that the FAA needs to do more to analyze the safety data it posses. \u201cThe next accident is in the data right now. And what are we doing to figure out what that is?\u201d she said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy promised to use artificial intelligence to review data from other airports to identify any similar risks elsewhere \u2014 particularly in eight metro areas with busy helicopter routes: Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles.",
      "Investigators are still in the early stages of determining why the American Airlines passenger jet and Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land Jan. 29. Both plunged into the Potomac River, killing everyone aboard. It will likely take more than a year to complete the final report.",
      "Investigators previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",
      "A string of crashes this year along with a near miss have brought attention to air travel, which remains overwhelmingly safe. On Jan. 31 a medical transport jet crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven. On Feb. 6 a small commuter aircraft went down off western Alaska, killing 10. On Feb. 17, a Delta plane crashed and flipped over upon landing in Toronto. Two small planes collided in midair in Arizona on Feb. 19, killing two people. And there was a scary moment Feb. 25 in Chicago when a Southwest Airlines plane came within 200 feet of crashing into another plane crossing the runway before it aborted its landing to avoid it.",
      "Here's a look at the Jan. 29 crash in Washington:",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members as it approached to land on a clear night. Nearby, the Army Black Hawk, with three soldiers on board, was practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in an attack or catastrophe.",
      "Investigators said they believe the helicopter crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane turned to adjust its approach. The NTSB now says that any time that runway is used \u2014 the one in question accounts for about 5% of the airport's flights \u2014 the helicopter route should be shut down.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert saying the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet for a second time, allowing it to fly closer than if the pilots couldn't see the plane. Controllers approved the request.",
      "Roughly 20 seconds later, the aircraft collided.",
      "The NTSB has recovered all flight data recorders and pulled the wreckage of both aircraft from the Potomac.",
      "Homendy told reporters last month that the Black Hawk's cockpit recorder suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew unable to hear air traffic control tell them, just before the crash, to move behind the jet.",
      "\u201cThat transmission was interrupted \u2014 it was stepped on,\u201d she said at a Feb. 14 briefing, leaving the helicopter\u2019s crew unable to hear the words \u201cpass behind the\u201d because their microphone key was pressed.",
      "The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters) at the time, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",
      "Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicate that the crew may not have had accurate altitude readings, with the helicopter\u2019s pilot calling out that they were at 300 feet (91 meters) but the instructor pilot saying 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said.",
      "\u201cWe are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,\u201d she said.",
      "That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters: one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter\u2019s black box captures its radio altitude.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump faulted the helicopter for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, he blamed an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system that he said should have been replaced years ago.",
      "The Black Hawk crew was made up of an instructor pilot with 968 hours of flight experience, a pilot with about 450 hours and a crew chief with nearly 1,150 hours. Army officials have said the crew was familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief, and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston who were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. A figure skating tribute event in Washington raised $1.2 million for the crash victims' families.",
      "Others included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas: four members of a steamfitters\u2019 union in suburban Maryland: nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia: and two Chinese nationals.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel may not have been part of a Signal chat in which other Trump administration national security officials discussed detailed attack plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- FBI Director Kash Patel was not part of a Signal chat in which other Trump administration national security officials discussed detailed attack plans, but that didn't spare him from being questioned by lawmakers this week about whether the nation's premier law enforcement agency would investigate.",
      "Patel made no such commitments during the course of two days of Senate and House hearings. Instead, he testified that he had not personally reviewed the text messages that were inadvertently shared with the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic who was mistakenly included on an unclassified Signal chat.",
      "That Patel would be grilled on what the FBI might do was hardly surprising.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump insisted \"it's not really an FBI thing,\u201d the reality is that the FBI and Justice Department for decades have been responsible for enforcing Espionage Act statutes governing the mishandling \u2014 whether intentional or negligent \u2014 of national defense information like the kind shared on Signal, a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications but is not approved for classified information.",
      "The Justice Department has broad discretion to open an investigation, though it remains unclear whether Attorney General Pam Bondi, who introduced Trump at a Justice Department event this month, would authorize such an inquiry. Trump administration officials insist that the details shared were not classified, though the Espionage Act technically criminalizes the mishandling of any information deemed to be closely held national defense information even if not classified.",
      "Multiple high-profile figures have found themselves under investigation in recent years over their handling of government secrets, but the differences in the underlying facts and the outcomes make it impossible to prognosticate what might happen in this instance or whether any accountability can be expected. There's also precedent for public officials either to avoid criminal charges or be spared meaningful punishment.",
      "\u201cIn terms of prior investigations, there were set-out standards that the department always looked at and tried to follow when making determinations about which types of disclosures they were going to pursue,\u201d said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Zweiback, who has handled classified information investigations.",
      "Those factors include the sensitivity of the information exposed and the willfulness of the conduct.",
      "A look at just a few of the notable prior investigations:",
      "The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was investigated but not charged for her use of a private email server for the sake of convenience during her time as secretary of state in the Obama administration. There appear to be some parallels with the Signal chat episode.",
      "The politically fraught criminal investigation was initiated by a 2015 referral from the intelligence agencies\u2019 internal watchdog, which alerted the FBI to the presence of potentially hundreds of emails containing classified information on that server. Law enforcement then set out to determine whether Clinton, or her aides, had transmitted classified information on a server not meant to host such material.",
      "The overall conclusions were something of a mixed bag.",
      "Then-FBI Director James Comey, in a highly unusual public statement, asserted that the bureau had found evidence that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information but recommended against charges because he said officials could not prove that she intended to break the law or knew that the information she and her aides were communicating about was classified.",
      "The decision was derided by Republicans who thought the Obama administration Justice Department had let a fellow Democrat off the hook. Among those critical were some of the very same participants in the Signal chat as well as Bondi, who as Florida's attorney general spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and mimicked the audience chant of \u201cLock her up!\u201d",
      "Among the biggest names to actually get charged is Petraeus, the former CIA director sentenced in 2015 to two years' probation for disclosing classified information to a biographer with whom he was having an extramarital affair.",
      "That material consisted of eight binders of classified information that Petraeus improperly kept in his house from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Among the secret details in the \u201cblack books\u201d were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus\u2019 discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors have said.",
      "Petraeus, a retired four-star Army general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wound up pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor count of unauthorized retention and removal of classified material as part of a deal with Justice Department prosecutors. Some national security experts said it smacked of a double-standard for its lenient outcome.",
      "Comey himself would later complain about the resolution, writing in a 2018 book that he argued to the Justice Department that Petraeus should have also been charged with a felony for lying to the FBI.",
      "\u201cA poor person, an unknown person \u2014 say a young black Baptist minister from Richmond \u2014 would be charged with a felony and sent to jail,\u201d he said.",
      "A former CIA officer, Sterling was convicted of leaking to a reporter details of a secret mission to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions by slipping flawed nuclear blueprints to the Iranians through a Russian intermediary.",
      "He was sentenced in 2015 to 3 1/2 years in prison, a punishment whistleblower advocates and other supporters decried as impossible to square with Petraeus' misdemeanor guilty plea just a month earlier.",
      "The details of the operation disclosed by Sterling were published by journalist James Risen in his 2006 book \u201cState of War.\u201d",
      "Sterling was charged in 2010, but the trial was delayed for years, in part because of legal wrangling about whether Risen could be forced to testify. Ultimately, prosecutors chose not to call Risen as a witness, despite winning legal battles allowing them to do so.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes \u2014 not for communicating with anyone \u2014 as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.",
      "In a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.",
      "Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's \u201cno connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.",
      "Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn't entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.",
      "Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.",
      "But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans\u2019 frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.",
      "Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.",
      "Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.",
      "If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.",
      "Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren't enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington D",
      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.",
      "For now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong \u2014 a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.",
      "That's something Waymo already has been doing since it began sending out its robotaxis in Washington in late January after a brief trial run in the capital last year.",
      "While the robotaxis continue to learn their way around the city, Waymo executives expressed confidence they will be able to work with regulators to clear the way for completely driverless rides at some point next year through its Waymo One app.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring the comfort, consistency, and safety of Waymo One to Washingtonians, those who work and play in the city every day, and the millions of people from around the world who travel to the District every year,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana.",
      "If Waymo's ambitions pan out, Washington and Miami next year will be added to four other U.S. markets where its robotaxis are transporting passengers \u2014 Phoenix, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Waymo and Uber also are teaming up to begin dispatching its robotaxis in Atlanta later this year.",
      "The growth has helped turn what began as a head-turning novelty in Phoenix and then in San Francisco into an increasingly common sight in the cities where Waymo operates. The company says it had provided more than 4 million driverless rides to paying customers through the end of this year, and is now providing them at a pace of 200,000 paid trips per week.",

Both Amazon and Tesla are gearing up to launch their own services in different U.S. cities while another ride-hailing service, Lyft, has announced plans to add robotaxis as an option in Atlanta and Dallas.",

      "Filling an empty space on the wall of presidential portraits in the Colorado Capitol with a new painting of Donald Trump could take time after one he disliked was removed and put into storage.",

      "On Tuesday, school groups and tourists filed past the wall where Trump's portrait once hung. Picture hooks and a plate reading \u201cDonald Trump \u2014 45th and 47th President \u2014 2017-2021 and 2025-2029\u201d remained. Some visitors stopped to take photos.",
      "It's not the first time that Trump's attention has turned to Colorado, which has shifted from leaning red to leaning blue over the past two decades.",
      "He criticized the Colorado Supreme Court in 2023 for declaring he was ineligible for the White House and could not appear on the state ballot because of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection. While campaigning last year, Trump made the Denver suburb of Aurora a focus of his illegal immigration message.",

She said her portraits of Trump and Obama were not political statements.",

      "Calling the situation unfolding in the country \u201cdire,\u201d Nicholas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage \u201cand put the interests of their people ahead of their own.\u201d",
      "There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 \u2014 and again until 2026.",
      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country\u2019s north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar\u2019s home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.",
      "Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating \u201cparticularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.\u201d",
      "He said Kiir and Machar don\u2019t trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.",
      "\u201cRampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\u201d Haysom said.",
      "\u201cGiven this grim situation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.\u201d",
      "Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.",
      "He said the U.N. takes the threat of the \u201cethnic transformation\u201d of the conflict very seriously.",
      "To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.",
      "Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions \u201cthrough dialogue rather than military confrontation.\u201d",

      "The bill would permit 16- and 17-year-olds to work overnight on school days and work longer than an eight-hour day before a school day. Some 14- and 15-year-olds would also be allowed to work those hours.",

      "\u201cParents know their kids best,\u201d he said Tuesday during a meeting of the Commerce and Tourism Committee, which approved the bill on a 5-4 vote. \u201cI can promise you that, even though I was challenged, my mom would have smacked me with a flip-flop if my academic grades had suffered.

      "Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin\u2019s pivotal Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin's pivotal state Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago, the latest sign of the intense interest in a contest that has obliterated spending records and drawn attention from President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser, Elon Musk.",
      "As of Tuesday, with just a week to go until the final day of voting, nearly 48% more early ballots have been cast compared with the same point two years ago, according to data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. More than 345,000 voters had returned ballots, either by mail or in person, compared with about 233,000 at this point two years ago during another race for a Supreme Court seat.",
      "The election will determine whether the court will remain under 4-3 liberal control or flip to a conservative majority. One of the current liberal justices is retiring.",
      "This year's race has morphed into a proxy battle over the nation\u2019s politics, with Trump and Musk getting behind Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate in a race that is officially nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cAll Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post late last week.",
      "Total spending on the race has reached more than $73 million, including more than $14 million by groups funded by Musk, according to a tally Monday by the Brennan Center for Justice. That's the most on record for any U.S. judicial race, breaking the $56 million spent on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court contest in 2023, when majority control also was on the line.",
      "All that spending and attention has helped fuel early voting, said Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin's former top elections official who now works as a consultant. He spoke while taking a break from working at a Madison poll site where people could vote early.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of money being invested,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cEverything seems to be focused on, \u2018Let\u2019s get out the vote.\u2019\u201d",
      "After previously being critical of early voting, Trump and the Republican Party are urging their supporters to cast their ballots before the final day of voting on April 1. Early voting ends Sunday. The strategy, which they deployed with great success in last year's presidential race, appears to be contributing to large turnout increases in more conservative counties across Wisconsin.",
      "Schimel's opponent, Democratic-backed Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, has raised more than $25 million for the race to date, including $5.5 million from the state Democratic Party since early February. Her supporters include billionaire Democratic megadonor George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, had raised more than $12 million, which includes more than $6 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party since early February.",
      "But outside groups have more than made up the difference in what the candidates have raised.",
      "The roughly $28 million spent by the candidates as of Monday was far exceeded by the roughly $45 million spent so far by outside groups, according to the Brennan Center calculation. Schimel and his allies, which include groups backed by Musk, have spent about $41 million, while Crawford and her supporters have spent about $32 million.",
      "Voters in Wisconsin do not register by political party, so it's impossible to know how many of the ballots already submitted came from Republicans or Democrats. But the data shows that the largest increases are coming from both Democratic- and Republican-heavy counties.",
      "Milwaukee County, the state's largest county and the one that is home to the most Democrats, led all counties in ballots returned with 54,750. That is more than 46% ahead of this point two years ago. Liberal Dane County, the state's second largest county and home to the state capital of Madison and the University of Wisconsin, has also seen a 46% increase.",
      "But Republican parts of the state also have seen big jumps.",
      "Voting was up in the three suburban Milwaukee counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, which are commonly referred to as the WOW counties. Ballot returns were up more than 62% in Waukesha and 51% in Ozaukee. In Washington, the most heavily Republican of the three counties, early voting was more than double two years ago.",
      "In Brown County, the state's fourth most populous one, which is reliably Republican, early turnout was up more than 34%.",
      "While the early voting is high for a spring election, it's far from what battleground Wisconsin saw at this point before the presidential race. A week before the Nov. 5 election, nearly 1 million voters had cast their ballots, almost four times as many as in this race to date.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules.",
      "On Monday night, Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told supporters that electing Crawford was important so she and other liberal justices can order a redraw of congressional boundary lines. Even though Wisconsin is a swing state, Republican-drawn lines have allowed the party to hold six of its eight congressional seats.",
      "\u201cAs soon as possible, we need to be able to revisit that and have fair lines,\u201d Jeffries said in a live discussion on the social media platform X. \u201cThe only way for that to be even a significant possibility is if you have an enlightened Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Schimel has accused Crawford of promising to Democrats that she will redraw the lines. Crawford has denied that.",

      "The gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack at an El Paso Walmart in 2019 in one of the the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history has been offered a plea deal to avoid the death penalty",
      "The gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart near the U.S.-Mexico border in 2019 would avoid the death penalty under a plea offer announced Tuesday, abruptly ending years of efforts by prosecutors to see that he face execution by lethal injection.",
      "El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya said during a news conference that his decision in the prosecution of Patrick Crusius, who drove across the state for one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history and posted a racist screed just before opening fire, was driven by a majority of victims' relatives who wanted the case behind them.",
      "\u201cThis is about allowing the families of the 23 victims who lost their lives on that horrific day \u2014 and the 22 wounded \u2014 to finally have resolution in our court system,\u201d Montoya said in a statement.",
      "\u201cNow, no one in this community will ever have to hear the perpetrator\u2019s name ever again,\u201d he added. \u201cNo more hearings. No more appeals. He will die in prison.\u201d",
      "But Montoya also acknowledged at the news conference that not all families agreed with the reversal by his office, which under previous leadership had committed to taking the case to trial and seeking the death penalty.",
      "Adria Gonzalez, a survivor who helped panicked shoppers toward exits, said she feels that not pursuing the death penalty is \u201ca slap in the face for all the victims.\u201d",
      "Under the offer, Montoya said, Crusius would plead guilty to capital murder and receive life in prison with no possibility of parole. The plea hearing and sentencing is set for April 21, Montoya said, and families will be able to give victim impact statements.",
      "Mark Stevens, an attorney for Crusius, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Crusius, 26, was already sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences at the federal level after pleading guilty in 2023 to hate crime charges. Under the Biden administration, federal prosecutors also took the death penalty off the table.",
      "Montoya said he supports the death penalty and believes Crusius deserves it. But he said he met with the families of the victims and while some were willing to wait as long as it took for a death sentence, there was an overriding desire to conclude the process.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over,\u201d said Elise Hoffmann-Taus, whose father, Alexander Hoffmann was among those killed. \u201cThis is the outcome I wanted.\u201d",
      "Montoya, a Democrat who took office in January after defeating a Republican incumbent appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, is the fourth district attorney to oversee the case.",
      "His predecessor, Bill Hicks, said following the announcement that while he had been ready to take the case to trial and pursue the death penalty, he could not fault Montoya\u2019s reasoning behind the plea offer.",
      "\u201cIt is not the reasoning I would have followed,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cI know that it was very hard for him, and I respect that it was a very difficult decision.\u201d",
      "Crusius, who is white, was 21 years old and had dropped out of community college when police say he drove more than 700 miles (1,100 kilometers) from his home near Dallas to El Paso.",
      "Moments after posting online his racist rant, which warned of a Hispanic \u201cinvasion\u201d of the state, he opened fire with an AK-style rifle inside and outside the store.",
      "Crusius was arrested shortly after the shooting and confessed to officers who stopped him at an intersection, police have said.",
      "Prior to the attack, Crusius appears to have been consumed by the immigration debate, posting online in support of building the border wall and other messages praising the hard-line border policies of President Donald Trump, who was in his first term at the time. He went further in the screed right before the shootings, saying Hispanics were going to take over the government and economy.",
      "In the federal case, prosecutors did not formally explain their decision not to seek the death penalty, but they did acknowledge that Crusius suffered from schizoaffective disorder, which can be marked by hallucinations, delusions and mood swings.",
      "Abbott, a Republican, said Tuesday after the announcement that he thought Crusius deserved to die: \u201cAny shooting like that is what capital punishment is for.\u201d",
      "The people who were killed ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to several grandparents. They included immigrants, a retired city bus driver, teachers, tradesmen including a former iron worker, and several Mexican nationals who had crossed the U.S. border on routine shopping trips.",
      "In 2023, Crusius agreed to pay more than $5 million to his victims. Court records showed that his attorneys and the Justice Department reached an agreement over the restitution amount, which was then approved by a U.S. district judge. There was no indication that he had significant assets.",

      "Vermont\u2019s child welfare agency has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the state routinely targets and tracks pregnant women deemed unsuitable for motherhood",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Vermont\u2019s child welfare agency has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the state routinely targets and tracks pregnant women deemed unsuitable for motherhood.",
      "The Department for Children and Families filed the request Monday, two months after it was sued by a woman who claims the state secretly investigated her when she was pregnant and won custody of her daughter before the baby was born. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont and the Pregnancy Justice advocacy group, seeks both an end to what it calls an illegal surveillance program and unspecified monetary damages for the woman, who is identified only by her initials, A.V.",
      "According to the complaint, the director of a homeless shelter where A.V. briefly stayed in January 2022 told the child welfare agency that she appeared to have untreated paranoia, dissociative behaviors and post-traumatic stress disorder. The state opened an investigation and later spoke to the woman\u2019s counselor, midwife and hospital social worker. The suit alleges the state received updates from the hospital and won temporary custody of the fetus while she was in labor and then immediately took the baby away when she was born.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the state had no jurisdiction before the baby was born, an argument the state rebuts in its filing.",
      "\u201cDCF is tasked with the difficult and delicate task of balancing the need to protect children from potential abuse and neglect against disruptions to families,\u201d wrote Assistant Attorney General David Groff. \u201cGiven its mission, DCF has the authority to investigate potential abuse to a soon-to-be-born child before the child is born. DCF need not wait for harm to occur after birth.\u201d",
      "The state argues that its family court system has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether a child needs care or supervision, and that the plaintiff can't relitigate custody decisions via a lawsuit. The motion neither confirms nor denies the existence of a \u201cpregnancy calendar\u201d used to track women, but says A.V. lacks standing to challenge it because she was never part of such a calendar and doesn't claim to have been.",
      "The lawsuit also names the hospital where the woman gave birth and a counseling center where she sought treatment as defendants. Lund, the counseling center, has also filed a motion to dismiss the case. In its response to the suit, Copley Hospital said it cooperated with the state's investigation as required under state law. The hospital denied that it illegally disclosed confidential medical information about A.V. or that it routinely collects and disseminates sensitive information about pregnant patients.",

      "The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina has accelerated significantly",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina accelerated significantly Tuesday as the Republican governor and leaders of the House and Senate came together to promise to pass an ambitious bill to charge one flat rate for all taxpayers.",
      "The details of the bill weren't released at a news conference, but every speaker made sure its goal was known \u2014 take the 6.2% top income tax rate down to 3.99% for everyone by the end of 2026.",
      "If the economy keeps growing and the tax base is increasing, the plan would cut $200 million from income taxes collected until that flat rate is 2.49%.",
      "Republican leadership also promised not to increase other taxes, such as those on sales and property, to offset income tax reductions, like other nearby states have done.",
      "South Carolina would be one of a number of states looking to find a way to cut taxes. Mississippi and Louisiana are considering a swap of sales taxes or gas taxes to offset revenue lost. There are proposals to cut taxes on tips or Social Security benefits in several states and Kentucky has already lowered its income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%.",
      "Mostly unsaid at the Statehouse news conference Tuesday was the exact mechanism to get from 6% to 3.99%, outside of a promise that everyone with taxable income would pay something.",
      "Now, some residents make more than $1 million but pay no South Carolina income tax, said Republican House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister.",
      "\u201cThere will be some people when we take away the gaming of the tax system \u2014 they will pay more. But we think 3.99% is a legitimately good fair tax to charge them,\u201d Bannister said.",
      "Figures from about five years ago when the income tax was first cut suggested about one-third of all people who filed a South Carolina income tax return paid nothing. Most of them were low-income residents.",
      "Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said it's only fair that even the lowest income earners pay something outside of sales tax and perhaps property tax.",
      "\u201cI look forward to a tax system in our state that is viewed as low, broad, fair, flat \u2014 doesn\u2019t take too much from anybody but everybody has to pay something, a little something, to be part of this great state of South Carolina,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "South Carolina can afford the income tax cut for now thanks to its booming economy and population, which has grown by 1.5 million people since 2000 to a total of 5.5 million residents. Many of them have been well-off retirees.",
      "The goal is to have one of the lowest income tax rates in the Southeast, lawmakers said. Bannister pointed out the 2.49% rate would be less than Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Alabama.",
      "South Carolina has less than two months left in the 2025 session to get the tax cut plan through the House and Senate and to the governor's desk. Legislative leaders said that can be done.",
      "No Democrats were seen among the several dozen lawmakers who flanked the governor and House and Senate leaders, although they have supported tax cuts before. They support the state's program to cut the top rate of 7% down to 6%, which should reach its goal next year.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",
      "He said there were many factors that could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.",
      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",
      "Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.",

      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",
      "That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.",

      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",

      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",

      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",

      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",
      "Spotify has already bumped up the price of its premium plan in the UK. After years of being held at \u00a39.99, it increased to \u00a310.99 in summer 2024, and \u00a311.99 last May.",

      "\"We've really tried with mid-price tiers and, frankly, struggled to get them to work,\" he said.",

      "\"Finding something in the middle that you can actually explain to consumers and that is different than what's already on offer has been really, really challenging,\" he explained.",
      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",

      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",

      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",
      "\"The UK is seeing breakthrough artists like Myles Smith and Lola Young,\" she added, \"but that journey is rarely about overnight success these days.",

      "Bob the Builder bet",
      "The OBR's acknowledgment that the government's planning reforms could significantly boost house building, was seen as a major win in Downing Street.",
      "It's a policy that doesn't involve taxes or spending yet is expected to provide a huge boost to growth.",
      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",
      "This comes as a result of local authority housing targets and council land being freed up.",
      "When the Planning and Infrastructure Bill passes later this year, which strips back judicial reviews, there should be a further increase in predicted growth.",
      "But the test is obviously actual spades and diggers in the ground and architects' plans being approved. This government is now all-in on Bob the Builder.",
      "There was some accountancy-driven cunning. Lists of public defence-related spending up and down the UK came from the unconstrained capital budget for buildings, which is basically exempt from the chancellor's non-negotiable financial rule to only borrow to fund day to day spending.",
      "But the cuts to welfare are very real. The 250,000 increase in people in poverty due to the cuts to health-related benefits does not include the impact of recipients getting new jobs.",
      "The Impact Assessment seems to confirm that the aim of the policy is more about saving cash than fundamental reform.",
      "In this and in other areas questions arise about whether the \"OBR tail wags the policy dog\" - i.e. is this really the way long-term policy should be formed?",
      "The big picture is that all of this becomes a lot easier if growth returns and interest costs calm.",
      "In the dreams of Number 11, while we assume the debate in autumn will be about what further tax rises are required, it is possible that by the time of October's Budget, they may not be needed."

      "As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.",
      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",

      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",
      "3. Jobs and services cut or created",
      "Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you.",
      "For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.",

      "Cian, 30, has been delivering pizzas in the west of Glasgow for more than two years. An employee of Pizza Hut franchise, Glenshire Group, he has always been paid the National Living Wage plus a fee of \u00a31.45 per delivery.",
      "But he said his terms and conditions were changed without consultation or warning.",
      "He said two weeks ago he and several other drivers were told via text message that his pay had increased to \u00a312.21 an hour but he had lost his \u00a31.45 delivery payments, or what the company calls \"discretionary driver commissions\".",
      "''The \u00a31.45 would pay for my fuel and a tiny bit of the running cost of my car but I've been living paycheque to paycheque,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We had multiple drivers just quit because they simply can't afford to do this job if they're having to pay for their own fuel. There's one shop that has lost every single one of their drivers.''",
      "In a letter to staff dated 10 March, seen by the BBC, Glenshire said: \"We have removed discretionary driver commissions with effect from today. This change is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our operations.\"",
      "The letter does not state that the company has any plans in place to ensure drivers' expenses will be paid by Glenshire.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the company said that ''driver commissions have not been reduced, rather the remuneration model has changed from a 'per delivery' amount to a 'per mile' basis\".",
      "'Attempt to offload drivers'",
      "Unite's head of hospitality, Bryan Simpson has accused Glenshire of ''a cynical attempt to offload over 100 drivers'' before the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs), the National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage on 1 April.",
      "Among the increases next month, the National Living Wage for people aged 21 and over will rise from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21.",
      "\"I have never seen something so blatantly unlawful occur, even in an industry, frankly, that is not known for decent workers rights. This is the worst that I've came across in over a decade,\" Mr Simpson said.",
      "He said the loss of drivers' commission per delivery could effectively mean that \"these workers are going to be brought below the minimum wage.",
      "\"They're going to be losing thousands of pounds a year. So, as far as we are concerned, this is fire and rehire under a different name.''",
      "'Not worth me keeping my job'",
      "Unite's grievance, seen exclusively by the BBC, also accused Glenshire of acting ''fraudulently'' by going into old staff timesheets and retroactively adding unpaid 20 minute rest breaks.",
      "In a text message seen by the BBC, Glenshire director Zibby Ghafoor told store managers ''all time sheets have been deleted for last week..can we please add breaks in.\"",
      "Unite claims Glenshire unlawfully deducted these breaks from their wages.",
      "In its statement, Glenshire said that there have been \"no changes to break policies\".",
      "A manager called Adam, not his real name, said he works for hours on his own in his store. He said it's simply not possible to take breaks.",
      "\"You do not get your 20 minutes of uninterrupted time ever...so not only do we not get breaks, we now get charged for the breaks that we don't take.''",
      "Cian says it's his ''civic duty'' to speak out even though he knows it could put him at risk of losing his job. ''I'm trying to help people who can't stand up for themselves, because the way the Glenshire group have treated everyone is abysmal. The long term ramifications of what they are doing, it's just not worth me keeping my job.''",
      "Glenshire Group employs more than 200 staff including more than 100 delivery drivers although over the last few days, the BBC understands several have quit.",
      "In the 10 March letter to staff, Glenshire said that with the increases in employer NICs and the National Living Wage rise on 1 April it was having to \"reassess our driver delivery model in order to retain business viability\".",
      "It also said drivers could choose to switch from being employed to self-employed.",
      "The letter stressed this would be a voluntary choice and would not be compulsory. Glenshire last night told the BBC there were \"no blanket changes to self-employed contracts taking place\".",
      "Call to investigate",
      "Employment lawyer Joanne Moseley of Irwin Mitchell warned that from 1 April, when the new National Living Wage is introduced, Glenshire could be in breach of minimum wage regulations.",
      "\"If Glenshire doesn't reimburse its drivers for payments they've incurred in connection with their employment - in this case their petrol expenses - they will be in breach of the NMW regulations. HMRC will investigate and has the power to impose financial penalties,\" she says.",

      "\"Although Glenshire Group operates as an independent franchisee and is ultimately responsible for its own employment practices, we take these allegations seriously.",

      "Ministers have delayed a tax to fund the removal of unsafe cladding from homes after developers warned it could hamper the government's housebuilding plans.",
      "The Ministry for Housing said on Monday the Building Safety Levy would be introduced from autumn 2026, rather than this year.",
      "The tax on new homes is expected to raise \u00a33.4bn to be spent on building safety, including efforts to take down dangerous cladding.",
      "The delay comes after developers said the tax could increase building costs and result in the government missing its target to build 1.5 million homes by 2030.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook told LBC the government was still committed to the tax and insisted the delay would not slow down the pace of improving building safety.",
      "\"The previous government left us with an unpalatable inheritance in that respect,\" Pennycook said.",
      "\"We've got to increase ther pace of works being done. Leaseholders are still trapped in these buildings.\"",
      "Neil Jefferson, chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, welcomed the delay as \"recognition from government that these additional costs will inevitably constrain housing supply\".",
      "But he suggested the \"grossly unfair\" tax on housing developers should be scrapped altogether.",
      "He said: \"As proposed it will add thousands of pounds to the cost of new homes, threatening the viability of sites across swathes of the country at a time when industry is striving to reverse the decline in homebuilding numbers that we have seen in recent years.\"",
      "Cladding removal plan not ambitious enough, say MPs",
      "New deadlines set for fixing dangerous cladding",
      "The tax was first announced in 2021 by the then-Conservative government.",
      "Some of the money raised from the tax will go towards the removal of dangerous cladding from buildings, following the deadly fire at Grenfell Tower.",
      "Ministers have set aside \u00a35.1bn to resolve the cladding crisis, expecting developers, building owners and social housing providers to pay the rest.",
      "Thousands of homes have been made safe, but as of December last year, work had yet to start on a quarter of the 1,323 tall buildings requiring attention.",
      "Up to 12,000 buildings and three million people could be affected.",
      "The lengthy process of identifying what work needs to be done and who should pay for it has left many residents living in fear of fires or with worries over costly repair bills.",
      "In its general election manifesto, Labour pledged to \"take decisive action to improve building safety\" and to \"put a renewed focus on ensuring those responsible for the building safety crisis pay to put it right\".",
      "Last year, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government was planning to introduce the Building Safety Levy in September this year.",
      "But in a letter to Rayner, dozens of developers said \"the ability of the industry to invest in increasing the supply of new homes to meet the government's 1.5 million target is being threatened by the imposition of new taxes\".",
      "Housebuilders say they are already paying \u00a36.5bn towards improving building safety through corporation tax and argue makers of unsafe cladding should bear more of the costs.",
      "Home Builders Federation estimates the tax could add \u00a31,580 to the cost of building a home and lead to the loss of about 70,000 affordable homes over 10 years.",
      "A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"This government is determined to make Britain's homes safer by making developers pay their fair share to fix unsafe buildings through the Building Safety Levy.",
      "\"We have extended the timeline to give developers more time to factor levy costs into their plans while continuing to support them to build safe homes, and at the same time we are continuing to work quickly to fix buildings with unsafe cladding through our Remediation Acceleration Plan.\""

    "story": [
      "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?",
      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",
      "Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.",
      "Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",

      "But there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.",
      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",
      "North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.",
      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",
      "Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ez63ndvo",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",

      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "This is the second year figures on special school capacity have been collected by the Dfe.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution, which operates more than 20 museums and research centres visited by millions yearly in Washington DC and New York City.",
      "The order directs the vice-president to \"eliminate improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology\" from the institute's museums, centres and the National Zoo in Washington.",
      "It also directs the interior secretary to restore federal properties, including parks, memorials and statues, which \"have been improperly removed or changed in the last five years to perpetuate a false revision of history\".",
      "The move is part of Trump's effort to shape American culture, in addition to politics.",
      "The order is titled \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\". It says that Vice-President JD Vance, who became a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents due to his position in government, will lead the purge.",
      "Trump's order says that Congress should not fund Smithsonian exhibits and programmes that \"divide Americans by race\". It alleges that the American Women's History Museum, which is in development, plans to \"recognize men as women\".",
      "It also singles out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, saying that the museum \"has proclaimed that 'hard work,' 'individualism,' and 'the nuclear family' are aspects of 'White culture'.\" The museum opened in 2016 in Washington as former President Barack Obama, America's first black president, was leaving office.",
      "The Smithsonian museums offer free entry to some 15 to 30 million visitors each year. It operates 21 museums in Washington, Virgina and New York.",
      "They include the National Museum of American History, the National Portrait Gallery, the American Art Museum, the National Zoo and more than a dozen others.",
      "The order also instructs Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to complete \"restorations and improvements\" to Independence Hall in Philadelphia. It comes ahead of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which took place within the building.",
      "Trump has set out to radically reshape American culture, which he says has been contaminated by \"woke\" left-wing ideology. He has signed several orders that are intended to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programmes from the federal government - some of which led to legal challenges.",
      "Shortly after taking office, Trump fired the board of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, and installed himself as chairman.",

    "summary": "After years of growth, the music streaming market is levelling off, so what will labels do next?",
    "story": [
      "After years of explosive growth, the music streaming market in the UK is levelling out, new research suggests.",
      "Almost half the population, 32.4 million people, has now signed up to apps like Spotify and Apple Music, according to music industry analysts MIDiA Research.",
      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",
      "Spotify has already bumped up the price of its premium plan in the UK. After years of being held at \u00a39.99, it increased to \u00a310.99 in summer 2024, and \u00a311.99 last May.",
      "The Swedish company is also reported to be introducing a new high-fidelity streaming option this year, which could cost an extra \u00a35 a month.",
      "Amazon Music, which is the UK's second-biggest streaming platform, also increased its prices in January.",
      "Mulligan said that was just the beginning.",
      "\"Over the course of the coming years, expect a continued and concerted effort from the music industry, of finding new ways to get subscribers to pay more money.\"",
      "Sony Music's president of global digital business, Dennis Kooker, argues that such increases are vital.",
      "\"Spotify has publicly commented that their intention is to launch a higher price tier. I'm relying on that, and assuming that that is going to happen,\" he said at an event held by the recording industry organisation the IFPI last week.",
      "According to MIDiA, one alternative would be the introduction of \"a really cheap, entry level\" subscription to attract new users; but Kooker rejected that idea.",
      "\"We've really tried with mid-price tiers and, frankly, struggled to get them to work,\" he said.",
      "Users who don't want to pay can already access a \"pretty robust\" offering on ad-supported services like YouTube; while a monthly subscription offers millions of songs to everyone.",
      "\"Finding something in the middle that you can actually explain to consumers and that is different than what's already on offer has been really, really challenging,\" he explained.",
      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",
      "Mulligan predicted that the growth of streaming services outside Europe and America could change the way we listen to music.",
      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",
      "The change has already begun. According to the IFPI, Sub-Saharan Africa was the world's fastest-growing music market last year, with revenues surpassing $100 million (\u00a3770,000) for the first time.",
      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",
      "\"The UK is seeing breakthrough artists like Myles Smith and Lola Young,\" she added, \"but that journey is rarely about overnight success these days.",
      "\"It can take five or six or seven years to get to the point where you're a big household name, winning awards and number one albums.",
      "\"So the work is going on behind the scenes. It just requires more navigation than before.\""

    "story": [
      "By his own recognition, G\u00e9rard Depardieu acts in a world that is no longer his own.",
      "On day three of his sexual assault trial in Paris, the French cinema star admitted that he was given to \"rude\" and \"vulgar\" language no longer regarded as acceptable.",
      "It got to the point a few years ago, he said, where he insisted no female assistants should come near him in his dressing-room, because they were too liable to be shocked.",
      "\"Knowing the vulgarity of the old world, today I try to avoid being listened to by the new world \u2013 so that I don't come across as detestable,\" he told the court.",
      "\"I am not very much at ease with this new society... I think my time is done.\"",
      "But he denies being a sexual abuser.",
      "\"I don't see how it could be fun feeling up a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I am not a metro-train groper,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of sexual assault on two women on a film-set in 2021.  Both say he touched them on intimate parts of the body.",
      "In court the actor repeated his defence: that he may have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance, but that there was never any sexual intent.",
      "If convicted, Depardieu could face five years in jail and a fine of up to \u20ac75,000 (\u00a363,000; $81,000). The trial should continue until Thursday at least.",
      "Since Monday the packed courtroom has been the scene of explosive exchanges between the two legal teams \u2013 with Depardieu's lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous conducting an aggressive defence aimed at undermining the credibility of the two plaintiffs.",
      "But on Wednesday it was Depardieu who was subject to intense questioning, and at one point appeared to imply that a hand on a buttock did not constitute sexual assault.",
      "\"I never carried out an act of sexual assault [against a plaintiff]. Anyway sexual assault in my view is worse than what she has said,\" he said under questioning from the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt.",
      "Smelling blood, the lawyer swooped: \"You're saying that sexual assault has to be more than a hand on the buttocks?\"",
      "Out of his seat shot Depardieu's lawyer.",
      "\"No, that is not what my client said,\" he said, accusing Ms Durrieu-Diebolt of \"trying to create quotes that can be tweeted by the media.\"",
      "There is evidently no love lost between the two sides.",
      "Mr Assous is seen by the plaintiffs' team as deliberately setting out to bait them. He in turn believes that feminist \"activists\" have been at work on the plaintiffs, encouraging them to file charges that they might not otherwise have brought.",
      "The events under discussion took place in Paris in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an aging actor coming to terms with his declining powers.",
      "It is the first time the actor has appeared in court on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and he has also been accused of rape, all of which he has denied.",
      "The first plaintiff \u2013 a set decorator \u2013 told the court on Tuesday that after a minor argument with Depardieu he caught her between his legs, held her by the hips and told her obscenities.",
      "The second plaintiff \u2013 an assistant director \u2013 said she had been assaulted by the actor on three occasions. On the first, she had been accompanying him from his dressing-room to the set when she felt his hand on her buttock.",
      "Another time he touched her breasts through her clothes, and a third time the buttocks again. After she told her superior what had happened, Depardieu allegedly called her a \"snitch\" and refused to have her come near him.",
      "For the defense,  Mr Assous produced photographs taken at the end of the shoot showing Depardieu and the plaintiff apparently smiling happily together. She said she had wanted to play the incidents down, and that she was not even sure at the time if they had constituted a penal offence.",
      "It was only two years later when she had seen media coverage of Depardieu's alleged sexual misconduct in other cases that she had decided to lodge a complaint with police, she said.",
      "She added the affair had left her in a state of anxious distress, and still today she was having difficulty sleeping.",
      "The trial has offered a rare chance for the French public to see the once-revered actor - star of films like Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac - at close quarters.",
      "He appeared in court dressed in black shirt and jacket, and leaning on the shoulder of his very large bodyguard.",
      "The bodyguard \u2013 named as Massika - was referenced regularly in proceedings.",
      "Depardieu said Massika's permanent presence made it impossible for him to have carried out the sexual attacks of which he is accused.",
      "The actor is himself very overweight, and told the court he had difficulty walking more than a short distance.",
      "\"My joints all hurt. Basically my body is bust,\" he said.",
      "In the courtroom he sits on a special box that Massika brought with him.",
      "It is white, and covered in kiss-marks and signatures from people who have given Depardieu support.",

      "People who speak English alongside other languages fill lexical gaps by \"borrowing the untranslatable word from another language\". When they do this often enough, the borrowed word \"becomes part of their vocabulary\", OED said.",
      "The majority of newly-added words from Singapore and Malaysia are names of dishes, a testament to the nations' obsessions with food.",
      "These include kaya toast, a popular breakfast option of toasted bread slathered with a jam made from coconut milk, eggs, sugar and pandan leaves; fish head curry, a dish combining Chinese and South Indian influences, where a large fish head is cooked in a tamarind-based curry; and steamboat, a dish of thinly-sliced meat and vegetables cooked in a broth kept simmering in a heated pot.",
      "\"All this talk of food might inspire one to get a takeaway, or to tapau,\" OED said, referring to another new word which originated from Mandarin and the Cantonese dialect, meaning \"to package, or wrap up, food to take away\".",
      "Apart from gigil, the newly-added Philippine words include the national pastime of videoke, the local version of karaoke which includes a scoring system, and salakot, a wide-brimmed, lightweight hat often used by farmers.",
      "Other Philippine additions include what the OED calls \"idiosyncratic uses of existing English words\", such as terror, sometimes used to describe a teacher who is strict, harsh, or demanding.",
      "The OED contains more than 600,000 words, making it one of the most comprehensive dictionaries in the English-speaking world.",
      "Its editors consider thousands of new word suggestions each year. These come from a variety of sources, including  its editors' own reading, crowdsourcing appeals, and analysis of language databases.",

    "story": [
      "One of London's most prestigious classical music venues has pulled out of England's cultural subsidy scheme because of \"crippling\" red tape and a controversial strategy that is seen as failing to prioritise artistic excellence.",
      "Wigmore Hall currently receives \u00a3344,000 of public money a year from Arts Council England, but will stop taking the funding from 2026.",
      "Director John Gilhooly said: \"The current policy is just too onerous, and they seem to have no interest in what's happening on the stage, [or] in the great artists of the world.\"",
      "The Arts Council said recipients of funding should be \"prepared to show how they will offer the public excellent value\", and that it is \"absolutely committed to creative excellence\".",
      "Mr Gilhooly said the venue does not \"fully believe in everything\" in the Arts Council's current strategy.",
      "Titled Let's Create, the plan is billed by the Arts Council as widening access to culture and cultural funding, but is seen by many as supporting grassroots and community work over artists who are at the top of their fields.",
      "Mr Gilhooly said the musicians who perform at Wigmore Hall are the artistic equivalent of Olympic champions.",
      "\"We also work with a community choir. In my view, both are excellent, both are outstanding things,\" he told BBC News.",

      "\"It wasn't advertised as an anti-Arts Council fund, but the speed with which the money came in suggests, certainly in the classical music public, there's a feeling that the Arts Council is not altogether on our side.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq309kexeo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

    "story": [
      "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
      "Now, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.",
      "In a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\".",
      "The findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.",
      "Mr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".",
      "\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\".",
      "\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"",
      "Feminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\".",
      "Chakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death.",
      "Perhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".",
      "Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.",
      "Chakraborty, who had been dating Rajput for a year and was living with him, had gone to live with her parents a few days before his death.",
      "\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief.",
      "But within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues.",

      "And Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.",

      "A video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt.",
      "The vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.",

      "\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"",
      "According to Ms Bhandare, Chakraborty \"became expendable in the pursuit of a juicy story\" since she \"was not a big name and had no powerful people backing her in the film industry\".",
      "What happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\".",

    "story": [
      "Ticketmaster \"may have misled Oasis fans\" with unclear pricing when it put their reunion tour on sale last year, the UK's competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have breached consumer protection law by selling \"platinum\" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.",
      "\"This risked giving consumers the misleading impression that platinum tickets were better,\" it said in an update to its investigation into Ticketmaster.",
      "The CMA has instructed Ticketmaster to change the way it labels tickets and reveals prices to fans in the future. Ticketmaster said it \"welcomed\" the advice.",
      "\"At Ticketmaster, we strive to provide the best ticketing platform through a simple, transparent and consumer-friendly experience,\" a spokesperson told the BBC, via email.",
      "\"We welcome the CMA's input in helping make the industry even better for fans.\"",
      "Dynamic pricing denied",
      "More than 900,000 tickets were sold for Oasis's long-awaited reunion tour, when they went on sale on 31 August last year",
      "But many fans were left out of pocket, when standard standing tickets advertised at \u00a3135 plus fees were re-labelled \"in demand\" and changed on Ticketmaster to \u00a3355 plus fees.",
      "Amid the fall-out, Oasis issued a statement saying they had no \"awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used\" in the sale of tickets for the initial dates.",
      "The CMA launched its investigation in September, to examine whether Ticketmaster had engaged in \"unfair commercial practices,\" and whether fans were pressured to buy tickets within a short period of time.",

      "\"We don't change prices in any automated or algorithmic way,\" the company's UK director, Andrew Parsons, told MPs last month.",

      "Changes requested",
      "The CMA did not comment on the issue of dynamic pricing, but said that Ticketmaster made it difficult for Oasis fans to make \"informed choices\".",
      "For example, it said, customers did not know that there were \"two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first\".",
      "This resulted in \"many fans waiting in a lengthy queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide whether to pay a higher price than they expected,\" the CMA continued.",
      "The watchdog acknowledged that Ticketmaster had made some changes to its business practices since the Oasis sale last August.",
      "However, it said, \"the CMA does not currently consider these changes are sufficient to address its concerns\".",

    "summary": "Robbie asked the group to join his stadium tour, after he discovered their music on BBC Radio 2.",
    "story": [
      "Thom Rylance, frontman of indie band The Lottery Winners, has experienced panic attacks since he was a child. But he'd never had one on stage... until last month.",
      "\"I've got this other, outgoing version of me that does the shows, and he just turns up every time,\" the singer explains.",
      "\"I don't really know him, and I think he's brilliant and quite handsome, but when we played Bournemouth, he just didn't come.\"",
      "The panic manifested as \"a tremendous sense of overwhelming dread\", he says, accompanied by sudden shortness of breath and a racing heartbeat.",
      "He isn't sure how, but he survived the gig without anyone noticing.",
      "YouTube footage shows him goading people into singing Reef's Place Your Hands, and taking selfies with fans during the encore.",
      "In his head, though, it was a disaster.",
      "\"I came off stage and I was really apologetic. I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I was awful. I couldn't speak'.",
      "\"And everyone was like, 'What you talking about? It was absolutely fine.'\"",
      "The reaction wasn't entirely unexpected. At the age of 35, Rylance has become adept at masking his anxiety.",
      "It's a topic he addresses frequently (and movingly) on the band's new album, KOKO, whose title is an acronym for \"Keep on keeping on\".",
      "The singer learned the phrase from his grandmother, who used it to comfort him when he was excluded from school.",
      "\"I didn't want to be bad or naughty, but there was something in me [that meant] I couldn't sit through the lessons,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I was expelled and taken away from all my friends, and it made me really sad \u2013 but my gran used to say, 'Keep on keeping on, Thom', and it stuck with me.\"",
      "'Where was my support?'",
      "The singer was belatedly diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, and the sense of relief hit him like a tidal wave.",
      "\"It was like a release of guilt,\" he says. \"Like, nothing I've ever done has ever been my fault!",
      "\"But it also came with a mourning period, where I was looking back and going, 'Where was my support? I didn't have to be a sad child'.",
      "\"I literally remember a teacher saying, 'If you don't do well in your GCSEs then your life is over.' That sent me spiralling because I was like, 'I don't want to be a junkie', you know?",
      "\"So, I've been going into schools recently and talking to kids with ADHD, just to show them that someone who did terribly in education can wake up every day excited and happy and ready for work.\"",
      "Rylance is speaking from Paris, where The Lottery Winners are wrapping up their latest tour.",
      "The band, completed by Robert Lally, Katie Lloyd and Joe Singleton, have been working tirelessly since they formed in Leigh, Greater Manchester, in 2008 \u2013 but success has been a slow grind.",
      "They signed their first record contract with Sire Records in 2016 after boss Seymour Stein (the man responsible for discovering Madonna) called them \"the best band since The Smiths\".",
      "But when he left the label the following year, the group went with him, delaying  their debut album by years.",
      "It finally arrived on British indie label Modern Sky in 2020, a week before the country went into lockdown, making promotion impossible.",
      "Even so, the band's buoyant indie pop songs and engaging online presence (Rylance is one of the funniest and likeable musicians on social media) helped them build a dedicated fanbase.",
      "By 2023, that support was support enough to send their third album, Anxiety Replacement Therapy, to number one, beating releases by The National and Jessie Ware.",
      "For Rylance, who spent his childhood \"feeling like an alien\", it was a huge deal.",
      "\"It's literally a trophy with a number one on it,\" he laughs. \"What bigger symbol of affirmation is there than that?\"",
      "How about being personally invited on tour by Robbie Williams?",
      "That's what happened last October. Robbie heard the band's single You Again on BBC Radio 2 and instantly booked them as his support act this summer.",
      "\"It was a really huge moment for me,\" says Rylance, who made his first public performance singing Williams' song Stronger on a school trip.",
      "\"Robbie's been a huge part of my life, so when he told me, 'I've listened to all of your albums', I was just like, 'What do you mean, Robbie Williams? Why are you saying that to me?'\"",
      "The pair subsequently struck up a firm friendship, and talk almost daily.",
      "\"Robbie's like my therapist,\" says Rylance. \"He's got ADHD as well, so he can relate to the things that overwhelm me.",
      "\"And I can literally ask him anything. I'll be like, 'Robert, how long do I put this pizza in the oven?'\"",
      "But Williams isn't the only famous name in his contacts.",
      "The Lottery Winners have recorded singles with Shaun Ryder, Nickelback and Boy George (\"a mild hit in Greece,\" laughs Rylance), while Noel Gallagher struck up a friendship with Rylance after playing with him last year.",
      "\"These people have always seemed so unreachable,\" he marvels. \"Noel Gallagher is not even... He's barely even a human being!",
      "\"So to have him right there in my phone... I've texted him for advice loads of times.\"",
      "That guiding hand proved crucial last November, when Rylance published an ill-advised tweet criticising musician Kate Nash's campaign to save the live music industry.",
      "He accused Nash of posing as a working class musician, pointing out she'd attended the Brit School - which he mistakenly thought was a private, fee-paying establishment.",
      "\"I wasn't very proud of that, and it ended up in the NME,\" says Rylance. \"They kept contacting me, asking me for a statement, and so I texted Noel, 'What should I do about this, mate?'",
      "\"He was like, 'Just tell them to speak to your new PR officer: Me.",
      "\"'I'll tell them you're too busy being mega to talk to the press.'\"",
      "In the end, Rylance took a different approach, apologising for his comments and offering to work with Nash, but Gallagher's support helped him keep a level head in a tricky moment.",
      "Today, he's still passionate about highlighting the issues around working class access to the arts.",
      "He recalls The Lottery Winners' first gig, at the Collier's Rest Pub in Leigh, 16 years ago.",
      "The venue was so packed that it ran out of beer, but the band were only paid \u00a330, which they immediately spent on a demo tape.",
      "\"I don't know how we did it,\" Rylance says. \"We were really, really poor for a long time.",
      "\"We kept going because we believed in it, but that's not a realistic prospect for a lot of people.",
      "\"If you don't have any money, you can't afford to make mistakes.\"",
      "Even now, the band need help funding their European tour. Last month, they accepted a grant from the UK's Music Export Growth Fund to help pay for visas and transport costs.",
      "\"I wouldn't be in Paris right now without that,\" Rylance admits. \"They match what we spend, and we're willing to invest as much as we can.\"",
      "That's where ADHD can come in handy. Rylance is relentlessly creative, always on the look-out for ways to promote the band. On the album, he even calls ADHD a \"neurospice\" that helps him \"see solutions before problems even arise\".",
      "To that end, he's got a plan to secure a second number one album this week. Since Friday, Lottery Winners have been hosting a pop-up shop in Leigh, with free live music every day and copies of KOKO for sale.",
      "\"I can promise you this, there isn't a single band who'll work harder than us,\" he says.",
      "To paraphrase his gran, they're keen on keeping on."

      "To a sizeable portion of the nation, Clarke's 50-year stream of biting beat poetry and kitchen sink stand-up comedy should qualify him for national treasure status.",
      "He's horrified at the suggestion.",
      "\"I hate that,\" he shoots back. \"I think it sounds like you're knocking on heaven's door.",
      "\"National treasure? Shnational shmeasure. Nah, I hate that. National treasure? Not while I'm alive. Not unless it comes with a generous stipend. Then I'll think about it.\"",
      "This invective is delivered with a sneer, a wink, and finally a cackle of laughter.",
      "The only stipend in his line of work is the antiquated allowance that's given to the poet laureate.",
      "\"What do you get for that, poet laureate? \u00a370 a year and a barrel of sherry? Not interested.\" He cackles loudly again.",
      "Clarke has been too rebellious a figure to be considered for poet laureate and its sherry-based salary, and at the age of 76 he argues he still has time to disqualify himself from being a fully paid-up national treasure.",
      "\"I could yet blot my copy book. I'm that foul-mouthed [person] that you've come to dredge up some grudging affection for, but I may yet do the wrong thing.\"",
      "For someone who has always gone against the grain, and occasionally off the rails, it is hard to imagine what he could do now to diminish his status, however.",
      "One honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.",
      "Although not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM.",
      "It was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40.",
      "Many of Clarke's poems were originally released with musical backings masterminded by producer Martin Hannett, who was known for his work with Joy Division.",
      "Clarke has mixed feelings about the results.",
      "\"It was never my idea to put my poetry to music but I couldn't think of an argument against it,\" he says.",
      "\"So it was a new adventure for me, but I think the results were patchy. When it was good, it was great. But I'm hyper-critical of my own stuff.",
      "\"It wasn't my idea, that's all I'm saying, but I'm glad I did it now. It's put me in line for this award, for a start.\"",
      "Hostile punk gigs",
      "Two days after that ceremony, Clarke will achieve another landmark moment when he headlines Manchester's Co-op Live arena, albeit with a scaled-back set-up compared with its full 23,500 capacity.",
      "Has he ever performed in an arena? \"I've done outdoor shows that I suppose qualify as an arena,\" he says. \"But I've never done an arena with a lid on it like this one before.\"",
      "It will be a far cry from the cabaret clubs where he started out in the city in the 60s, and the punk nights where he made his name in the 70s, after winning over hostile fans who initially aimed spit and bottles in his direction.",
      "So what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?",
      "\"The more the merrier,\" he replies. \"If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.\"",
      "'Somebody up there likes me'",
      "He performed live with Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, The Fall and Elvis Costello, achieving cult status with social-realist poems like Beasley Street and Evidently Chickentown, the antisocial I Don't Wanna Be Nice, and the more surrealist (I Married A) Monster From Outer Space and Valley of the Lost Women.",
      "However, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.",
      "\"Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.\"",
      "Clarke eventually got clean after meeting his wife Evie, and his professional revival really began when Evidently Chickentown was used over the end credits of an episode in the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.",
      "Fellow poets, comedians and musicians lined up to hail his influence in a 2012 BBC documentary, with Steve Coogan speaking about his \"spirit of dissent\", and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, calling him \"my hero\".",
      "Turner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.",
      "The original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. \"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,\" it begins.",
      "Wedding favourite",
      "Clarke originally released the poem on record with a kitsch musical backing in 1982.",
      "\"It should have been done like Alex does it from the start,\" he says. \"I mean, that is the definitive version. I love it.\"",
      "The Arctics' version continues to strike a chord with a new generation and last year it had more streams around the world than any other track over a decade old.",

    "summary": "Funding problems meant Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light was almost axed weeks before filming began.",
    "story": [
      "The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.",
      "Peter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became \"conversations in rooms\" instead.",
      "He argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "The Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.",
      "Kosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still \"too great\" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.",
      "\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"",
      "Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.",
      "He said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".",
      "He said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".",
      "But the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".",
      "Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.",
      "Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.",
      "One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".",
      "Kosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.",
      "Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.",
      "\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.",
      "\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.",
      "\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"",
      "The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.",
      "And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.",
      "Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".",
      "\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.",
      "Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.",
      "Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.",
      "Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.",
      "Spence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.",
      "Streaming levy",
      "Figures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.",
      "Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.",
      "But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?",
      "In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".",
      "On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".",
      "\"We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,\" she said.",
      "She recently told a House of Commons committee she would like to see an uplift in tax relief for high end television, similar to the one already given to the film sector.",

    "summary": "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 could the lasting impact of the pandemic play a part?",
    "story": [
      "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".",
      "\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.",
      "Its owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\".",
      "\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"",
      "Mr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years.",
      "And according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".",
      "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.",
      "In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.",
      "\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.",
      "There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.",
      "But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did",
      "And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?",
      "Did the pandemic change a generation?",
      "For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.",
      "A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.",
      "Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".",
      "A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.",
      "Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"",
      "There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.",
      "Socialising less - or just differently?",
      "When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"",
      "Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".",
      "This rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.",
      "But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\"",
      "There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".",
      "\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"",
      "\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".",
      "A 'storm' coming for clubs?",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".",
      "Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.",
      "In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.",
      "\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"",
      "Mr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.",
      "If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.",
      "In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.",
      "Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".",
      "The company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.",
      "The places bucking the trend",
      "The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.",
      "But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.",
      "The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".",
      "There are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success.",
      "Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.",
      "Co-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"",
      "Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.",
      "\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance.",
      "Ultimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs.",
      "\"For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,\" he says.",
      "Why preserving clubs matters",
      "Cat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. \"Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,\" she says. \"Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.",
      "\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"",
      "Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.",
      "In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.",
      "The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.",
      "It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"",
      "And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.",
      "\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"",
      "But without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.",

      "An NHS software provider has been fined \u00a33m by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) over security failings that led to a ransomware attack on the NHS.",
      "The Advanced Computer Software Group was fined for a breach that put personal information of 79,404 people at risk, the UK's data protection watchdog said.",
      "The firm provides IT and software services to organisations around the country, including the NHS and other health providers, handling information in its role as a data processor.",
      "The breach took place in August 2022, when hackers gained access to patients' phone numbers and medical records as well as details of how to gain entry to the homes of 890 people receiving care at home.",
      "The unidentified hackers were able to gain access to the information by using a customer's account that did not have sufficient protection in the form of multi-factor authentication.",
      "The regulator's investigation concluded that Advanced did not have appropriate security measures in place prior to the incident.",
      "The cyberattack led to the disruption of critical services including NHS 111, and left some healthcare staff unable to access patient records.",
      "Software used to facilitate patient check-ins was also impacted.",
      "Last year, the regulator criticised Advanced over the incident, which placed \"further strain\" on a \"sector already under pressure\".",
      "While the company had installed multi-factor authentication across many of its systems, \"the lack of complete coverage\" was criticised by Information Commissioner John Edwards.",
      "\"The security measures of Advanced's subsidiary fell seriously short of what we would expect from an organisation processing such a large volume of sensitive information,\" Mr Edwards said.",
      "He added the fine should serve as a \"stark reminder\" to organisations to ensure they have \"robust security measures in place\".",
      "\"There is no excuse for leaving any part of your system vulnerable,\" Mr Edwards added.",
      "Last year, the ICO announced it intended to impose a provisional \u00a36m fine on Advanced for the breach.",
      "However, the watchdog said the sum had been halved because of the proactive engagement of Advanced with police, cyber security services and the NHS following the attack.",

    "story": [
      "An NHS trust criticised over the avoidable death of a newborn baby was paid \u00a32m for providing good maternity care, the BBC can reveal.",
      "A senior coroner ruled on Friday that University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust contributed to Ida Lock's death and had failed to learn lessons from previous maternity failures.",
      "Despite this, the trust claimed it had met all 10 standards under an NHS scheme aimed at promoting safe treatment.",
      "Ida's mother Sarah Robinson said the behaviour of the trust - which has declined to comment - was \"another kick in the teeth\" while her father Ryan Lock labelled it \"disgusting\".",
      "Senior coroner for Lancashire James Adeley concluded that Ida had died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care.",
      "Ida, who was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019, died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen.",
      "Dr Adeley ruled her death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said eight opportunities had been missed \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "Her five-week inquest at Preston County Hall heard that many of the issues identified in a 2015 independent review of UHMB's maternity services were still evident in November 2019.",
      "The RLI is run by the UHMB trust.",
      "'Critical inspection'",
      "Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, maternity departments in England are encouraged to provide good care by meeting 10 safety standards, including properly investigating deaths and listening to parents' concerns.",
      "Trusts which certify they have met these standards receive a rebate on their insurance premiums, in addition to a share of money paid by NHS trusts which do not.",
      "In the five years that the scheme has been running, UHMB said it had met the 10 standards four times.",
      "In 2018, the first year of the programme, the trust's self-certification led to it being paid \u00a31,288,241.",
      "In 2019, the year of Ida's death, it received \u00a3734,112 after again claiming to have hit all of the criteria.",
      "The UHMB trust also claimed a perfect 10-out-of-10 record in 2020 but their submission was reviewed by NHS Resolution following a critical inspection of maternity services by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The regulator's report rated maternity services as \"inadequate\", with UHMB's score downgraded to three out of 10.",
      "Consequently, UHMB was not given any money that year by NHS Resolution, and the trust was made to repay most of the amount it had received in 2019.",
      "'Painting a false picture'",
      "When told about the payments scheme and how the trust had benefitted from it, Mr Lock said it was \"disgusting\".",
      "He said: \"It's painting a false picture so they can receive money.\"",
      "A former maternity risk manager at the trust, Rox-Anne Hetherington, said Morecambe Bay's actions were in keeping with her experience.",
      "\"I can, hand-on-heart, say that it wasn't a case of 'What have we done to [make things better]?'",
      "\"It was a case of 'What are we going to say we've done?'\"",
      "Dr Bill Kirkup, whose 2015 inquiry exposed widespread failings in maternity care, including the preventable deaths of 11 babies and a mother at the trust's Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, also said he wasn't surprised.",
      "\"Some trusts put a lot of effort into how they can present the best picture of themselves, and much less effort into whether they're actually making improvements underneath,\" he said.",
      "'Not fully compliant'",
      "UHMB's claims are in line with other struggling trusts which have also made similar erroneous submissions under the Maternity Incentive Scheme.",
      "The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust was forced to repay almost \u00a31m after it similarly claimed to have met all of the safety standards.",
      "A review of its maternity care, published in 2022, found more than 200 babies and mothers could have survived with proper care.",
      "The East Kent University Hospitals trust, where an inquiry found at least 45 babies could have survived, was also forced to repay \u00a32m after falsely claiming it had met the safety criteria.",
      "In a statement, NHS Resolution said \"University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust initially self-reported full compliance with the Maternity Incentive Scheme in years 1, 2, 3 and 5.",
      "\"However subsequent NHS Resolution reviews of the Trust's evidence for years 2 and 3 following the publication of their CQC report demonstrated that they were not fully compliant for those years.",

      "'If I lose my benefit payments I'll struggle to get to work'",
      "Starmer says cost of sickness benefits 'devastating'",
      "How is universal credit changing?",
      "The government has also announced changes to universal credit, which is paid to 7.5 million people.",
      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",
      "Who will be affected by the changes?",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that it expects 3.2 million families \u2013 a mixture of current and future recipients - to lose out financially as a result of the total package of measures, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year.",

      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",

In England, ministers have already promised three big changes: shifting more services from hospitals into the community, focusing on preventing ill-health and making more use of new technology.",
      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",

      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",

      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",

      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

      "He said he had agreed with partners at the summit, which hosted representatives from 30 nations as well as the European Union and Nato, that \"we must go further now to support the peace process, support Ukraine and increase the pressure on Russia to get serious\".",
      "\"It means increasing the economic pressure on Russia, accelerating new tougher sanctions, bearing down on Russia's energy revenues, and working together to make this pressure count,\" he said.",
      "Starmer said that the political mood to find a just and lasting peace in Ukraine was \"stronger and broader\" than it had ever been, adding that \"Europe as a whole has not been this strong and united in a long time\".",

      "When asked whether most top jobs would go to white men on merit, Farage said that, in many cases, women make \"very different life choices\" to men.",
      "\"Look at business,\" he said. \"Men are prepared to sacrifice their family lives in order to pursue a career and be successful in a way that fewer women are.",
      "\"And those women that do have probably got more of a chance of reaching the top than the blokes.\"",
      "His comments came at a lunch with journalists on Wednesday, with Farage making a speech and taking questions on a range of topical issues.",
      "As Reform UK leader, Farage sets the direction for the party of more than 200,000 members and four members of Parliament.",
      "Farage praised US President Donald Trump's drive to scrap diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) policies, designed to prevent discrimination in the workplace.",
      "DEI programmes aim to promote participation in workplaces by people from a range of backgrounds.",
      "Their backers say they address historical or ongoing discrimination and underrepresentation of certain groups, including racial minorities, but critics argue such programmes can themselves be discriminatory.",
      "Asked why the world of business had been dominated by white men in the past, Farage said: \"Because the country was white men, the country of business was white men.",
      "He added: \"Men went to work, women stayed at home and brought up kids. The world has evolved and changed since then.",
      "\"The world is changing. The world is changing. Women in work. Changes in population.",
      "\"But the idea that you give certain groups privileges not based on merit but based on skin colour or sexuality or whatever is wrong, it doesn't work.\"",
      "Farage leads a group of four male MPs in the House of Commons, but said he was very \"pro-women\".",
      "This week, the party announced its candidate for the upcoming Runcorn and Helsby by-election as former Cheshire East councillor and local magistrate Sarah Pochin.",
      "Farage said: \"Have we picked her because she's a woman? No. We picked her because the best candidate.\"",

      "Farage faced a question about what he planned to do to appeal to female voters.",
      "He said young men were \"more attracted to small-c conservatism\" and suggested they backed his party because they were more \"impulsive\" than women.",
      "\"That has nothing to do with me whatsoever, that's just the way it is,\" he said.",
      "Farage said society was trying to \"feminise\" young men in a way that made the views of self-proclaimed misogynist influencer Andrew Tate more appealing to them.",
      "But Farage stressed: \"I'm not a Tate supporter. I'm identifying the truth, that young men feel that they're not allowed to be blokes.\"",
      "Farage's relationship with tech billionaire and senior Trump adviser Elon Musk also came up during the event.",
      "Musk had been a vocal supporter of Reform and last year, Farage told journalists his party was in negotiations with the Tesla CEO about a potential donation.",
      "But there was a rift between them over Musk's support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.",

      "But latest estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the government will fall short of that figure, even with planning reforms outlined in the chancellor's Spring Statement on Wednesday.",
      "A government spokesperson said further reforms not reflected in the OBR's forecast would help to reach the 1.5 million target.",
      "The Home Builders Federation said the government \"urgently needs\" to make mortgages more accessible to first time buyers to meet the target.",

      "The chancellor claimed that reforms to the planning system would put the government \"within touching distance\" of achieving the 1.5 million target.",
      "But despite the chancellor's optimistic outlook, the figures actually suggest that planning reforms are on course to achieve far fewer new homes than first hoped.",
      "The central plank of those reforms are ambitious mandatory targets for every local authority, to grant more planning permissions.",
      "Reeves said the government would get to within \"touching distance\" of its 1.5m target, telling MPs that 1.3m new homes would be created by 2029.",
      "However, the 1.3m figure she used includes housebuilding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "In fact, only 1m new homes are expected to be built in England, it's understood.",
      "OBR figures also make clear that many of those homes would have been built anyway, regardless of the government's planning reforms.",
      "The watchdog says reforms introduced by Angela Rayner will only lead to an extra 170,000 homes in England, a quarter of the amount needed to hit her target.",
      "Ministers have been keen to point to the economic boost that those 170,000 new homes will achieve.",
      "Last year saw a record low for housing projects granted planning permission in England, with just over 30,000 projects given the go-ahead.",
      "The chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, Neil Jefferson, told the BBC the government needs to address \"other barriers\" to \"reverse the declines we have seen in supply and deliver much needed housing\".",
      "He said the planning changes were \"very positive but further interventions are urgently needed if we are to increase housebuilding to the level required\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"The OBR forecast only factors in reforms to the National Planning Policy Framework in England which is just one element of this government's efforts to increase housebuilding.",
      "\"Further reforms such as the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, the government's long term housing strategy and the new Affordable Homes Programme are not reflected in the forecast and will all help to reach the 1.5 million target.\"",

      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",

      "The government is trying to avoid tariffs, set to come into effect on 2 April, through \"intense negotiations\" with US counterparts, Sir Keir Starmer added.",
      "The PM's comments come amid concerns tariffs could upend global motor trade and supply chains, with one of the biggest UK-based exporters to the US, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), in line to be the one of the manufacturers most affected.",
      "Trump has argued the measures will lead to \"tremendous growth\" for the car industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US.",

      "In the UK, the SMMT said the announcement of the tariffs by Trump on Wednesday were \"not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing\" but called on both governments to strike a deal.",
      "Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, said the \"UK and US auto industries have a long-standing and productive relationship, with US consumers enjoying vehicles built in Britain by some iconic brands, while thousands of UK motorists buy cars made in America\".",

      "'Unintended consequences'",
      "John Neill, the founder of Unipart and the firm's former executive chairman, said the Trump tariffs were \"a gift to the Chinese car industry\", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives.",
      "He added the tariffs could have \"unintended consequences\".",
      "\"The Americans may think they're boxing the world car industry out of the US, but the reality is they are going to box the US car industry out of the world,\" he said.",
      "JLR is the the most exposed UK-based car firm to Trump's tariffs, according to Ibisworld analyst Yusuf Allinson.",
      "He said the tariffs \"represent a grave danger to a UK car manufacturing sector in transition\" as firms retool factories for electric vehicles.",
      "Mr Allinson added that it would be \"extremely difficult\" for UK car firms to find alternative markets because the \"sector is saturated\".",
      "\"UK-made vehicles are already exported globally, so creating new demand to replace falling US volumes will be a challenge,\" he said.",
      "He added that the UK could respond with retaliatory tariffs on Tesla, which is currently the most popular electric vehicle sold in the UK, selling more than 50,000 cars per year.",

      "This marks the end for some and the gloom that can be caused by GMT, and the start of British Summer Time (BST) and lighter evenings.",
      "However, the Labour MP for Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard, Alex Mayer, has called for a \"major overhaul of time\" and a conversation about \"how best to use our nation's daylight hours\" in a parliamentary debate.",
      "But why do the clocks go back and forward in the UK each year?",
      "The process of moving the clocks forward by one hour in the summer was started during World War One in Germany in 1916, as a way to save energy resources during lighter evenings.",
      "Weeks later other countries followed suit, including the UK, where it was named British Summer Time. During World War Two in 1941, the then-prime minister Sir Winston Churchill introduced a system where clocks were advanced by two hours.",
      "This meant that during winter, while clocks went back an hour they were still one hour ahead of GMT to increase productivity during daylight.",
      "This ended in 1945, but briefly returned two years later due to severe fuel shortages that summer.",
      "What does the debate involve?",
      "Mayer wants a return to how things were in World War Two and is hosting an adjournment debate in Parliament. These debates are a chance for MPs to raise an issue and get a response from a minister but do not include a vote afterwards.",
      "Mayer has argued that a return to what is known as \"Churchill Time\" could help save a combined \u00a3485m in yearly electricity bills - and reduce carbon emissions by more than 400,000 tonnes.",
      "She called this \"a low-cost, high-impact proposal\" to \"help meet climate goals, reduce energy bills, and boost our High Streets by making better use of the daylight hours we already have\".",
      "She is not the first MP to bring this discussion to Westminster.",
      "In 2012, a bid by Conservative MP Rebecca Harris to move UK clocks forward by an hour for a three-year trial period failed after the legislation ran out of time in the House of Commons.",
      "In 1968, there was a three-year experiment to keep BST in place throughout the year. On average, there was a huge reduction in road casualties, but this has since been attributed to new drink-driving legislation in 1967.",
      "What are the arguments against the change?",
      "During that experiment in northern Scotland, there was a net increase in the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads, because during the darkest days of December sunrise would not take place until 10:00.",
      "In 2012, when MPs voted against it, many objections focused on the impact of a change on road accidents.",
      "Critics argued it would make the lives of outdoor workers harder and increase road accidents due to the darker mornings - although those in favour of a change argue it would reduce evening accidents.",
      "Other sources have expressed concerns about the negative impact of extended daylight evenings to health and sleep patterns.",
      "Recent studies suggested modern power consumption habits mean energy savings made by reducing evening lighting were now offset by increased energy consumption, in the warmer lighter evenings.",

      "Ms Perry said her role was not to determine any criminality but to assess the \"veracity\" of the bullying and harassment allegations against Lowe and his staff, determine any legal implications, and recommend measures to prevent future incidents.",
      "She recommended Reform should be \"quite strict\" about ensuring party members were \"fully acquainted\" with parliamentary rules on bullying and discrimination laws.",
      "Lowe had previously claimed that Ms Perry had contacted him to say she found \"no credible\" evidence against him - leading to the KC to contact the BBC to rebut his claims.",

      "The report said one of the women made the initial allegations of \"bullying and unacceptable conduct from a particular individual in the constituency office\" on 18 December last year.",
      "She also formally made her complaint to the Parliamentary Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) in January.",

      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?"

    "story": [
      "Talk of growth forecasts and self-imposed financial rules may feel very distant from you and your life, but the Spring Statement could affect both your job and your money.",
      "Here's what it could mean for you.",
      "1. Benefit changes",
      "If you are on benefits, you could be directly affected.",
      "The changes to the benefits system, announced last week, will see some people lose support from next year, although universal credit payments are set to rise from next April.",
      "This means:",
      "If you claim Personal Independence Payments and do not qualify when the criteria are tightened, then you are likely to be hardest hit. Some 370,000 people are expected to lose their entitlement altogether, and others will receive less than they expected. The average loss is \u00a34,500 a yearEven if you are not affected by the Pip changes, you may still lose out. Overall, by 2029-30, some 3.2 million families - some current recipients and some future recipients - will see cuts, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year once inflation is taken into accountIf you are on universal credit, then you could benefit.

      "Other changes to the welfare reforms also mean less money than you may have expected.",
      "For example, the government had said there would be a rise in the standard allowance for universal credit for 6.5 million people.",
      "It will now rise to \u00a3106 a week, for a single claimant aged over 25 in 2029-30, rather than the \u00a3107 previously billed.",
      "The health element of universal credit, which is paid if your ability to work is limited,  was set be halved for new claimants to \u00a350 a week in 2026-27, and will now be frozen thereafter.",
      "Ministers have said that existing claimants will be affected too with their entitlement frozen at \u00a397 a week until 2029-30.",
      "2. Living standards and household bills",
      "The Spring Statement doesn't come in isolation. Next week, a series of household bills will rise.",
      "From 1 April, you will pay more for water, energy and your council tax.",
      "However, if you're over 21 and on the minimum wage then your hourly rate will go up to \u00a312.21 an hour, from the current \u00a311.44.",
      "Nonetheless, the rising cost of living has pushed many of you to your financial limit.",
      "And now the prices you pay are expected to rise at a faster pace this year than previously thought.",
      "Inflation - is expected to average 3.2% this year, according to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before falling to 2.1% in 2026 and then 2% from 2027. The government's target is 2%.",
      "As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.",
      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",
      "This is measured by real household disposable income which is expected to rise by just over 2% between now and 2030. That means on average you are expected to be \u00a3500 a year better off by 2030. However, this is relatively small by historical standards.",
      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",
      "3. Jobs and services cut or created",
      "Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you.",
      "For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.",

    "story": [
      "\"The world has changed\" is the mantra we are hearing from the government.",
      "It is a phrase designed to explain and justify the chancellor's argument on Wednesday in what is known as her Spring Statement.",
      "The Conservatives are branding it an \"emergency Budget\", which ministers insist is nonsense, but it is certainly true it is a bigger event than it was expected to be just a few months ago.",
      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",
      "The backdrop is pretty bleak.",
      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",
      "Add to that the wild unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, the looming prospect of tariffs and the vast uncertainty over Ukraine's future and European security.",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",

      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",

      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "It is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.",

      "Made up of volunteers, the group runs events along the canal and has fundraised to install planters, benches and signs.",
      "The prospect of it having to close due to water shortages was \"utterly devastating\", she said.",
      "\"There has to be a solution found, and my view is that the Welsh government and its leaders are the only people who can bring all the main players together.\"",
      "She pointed to new housing estates being built along the canal with the waterway used as a marketing tool, and said the local council hoped to be able to open up further stretches down to Cwmbran, describing the economic benefits as \"unimaginable\".",
      "\"Should we have problems with water supply then what's going to happen to those plans for restoration that we've all been working on for the past three years?\"",
      "News broke of the difficulties facing the canal in a letter sent to local businesses by Gland\u0175r Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.",
      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",
      "Last year, Gland\u0175r Cymru lost an appeal against some of the conditions stipulated by environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.",
      "\"The canal took around 30% of the total flow of the river in 2022 - which was the last dry year period,\" said Gail Davies-Walsh, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru which represents river groups across Wales.",
      "Limits on abstraction were needed to ensure the species and habitats had sufficient water to survive \"particularly during dry summers and low flow periods,\" she said.",
      "Mark Evans, director of Gland\u0175r Cymru, said the trust accepted it could no longer continue to abstract water from the Usk at the same level as it had in the past.",
      "But recent dry weather highlighted the urgency of finding an alternative supply, he said.",
      "\"The amount of water we can take is starting to really concern us,\" he explained.",
      "\"It's urgent today, looking at the forecast for the next week.",
      "\"At some point we'll have to stop the boats from using the locks,\" he warned, adding that both the canal's users and its wildlife would be impacted as levels fell.",
      "Discussions have been taking place in recent weeks with Welsh Water over whether it could help to support the canal during periods of prolonged dry weather.",
      "But this would come with \"financial implications\" and the potential of having to pay commercial rates for the water, resulting in a considerable bill the charity could not afford, he claimed.",
      "Alasdair Kirkpatrick, owner of Beacon Park Boats, said he had already received phone calls from customers who had booked boat trips asking about the impact on them.",
      "\"I never saw this one coming,\" he said, \"it has really shocked us all.\"",
      "\"All my customers nip down to the local pubs and restaurants, 25% of them fly in from overseas from places like America and Australia, using local taxis and train services and spending a fortune locally,\" he added.",
      "He urged the Welsh government \"to fund Welsh Water to continue to maintain water levels and keep all the operators of this canal in business - it cannot be lost\".",
      "Gavin Bown from Natural Resources Wales said regulating water abstraction was \"a complex, evidence-based process that carefully balances environmental needs with those of local communities\".",
      "\"Our priority is to protect the integrity of the River Usk and the Severn Estuary, both designated as special areas of conservation,\" he explained, adding the regulator would continue to work collaboratively with the Canal and River Trust.",
      "A Welsh Water spokesman said the River Usk was \"one of the primary sources of drinking water to around 250,000 customers across south east Wales\".",
      "But it remained \"one of our least drought-resilient supply areas\", with limited water resources to deal with the impacts of climate change and population growth.",
      "\"We have proposed in the driest of years to supply some customers with water from the River Tawe through an emergency pumping station and use this spare capacity in abstraction from the River Usk to support the canal,\" he explained.",
      "However this would come at a cost, with discussions ongoing over whether this would be affordable to the trust.",

      "A rare new species of two-clawed dinosaur has been discovered by scientists in Mongolia's Gobi Desert.",
      "The species, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, was unique within a group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which stood on their hind legs and usually had three claws.",
      "It was medium-sized, with an estimated weight of approximately 260kg.",
      "Researchers believe the species' long, curved claws and its ability to strongly flex them would have made it an efficient grasper of vegetation.",

      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",

      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",

      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Dr Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Dr Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Dr Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Dr Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Dr Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Dr Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",

      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Dr Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 09:51:03 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts say using even such a privacy-focussed platform for national security matters is very unusual.",
    "story": [
      "The messaging app Signal has made headlines after the White House confirmed it was used for a secret group chat between senior US officials.",
      "The editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to the group where plans for a strike against the Houthi group in Yemen were discussed.",
      "Signal's creator Matthew Rosenfeld - who is better known by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike - joked the \"great reasons\" to join the platform now included \"the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations\".",
      "But others are not seeing the funny side, with Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer calling it \"one of the most stunning\" military intelligence leaks in history and calling for an investigation.",
      "But what actually is Signal - and how secure or otherwise were the senior politicians' communications on it?",
      "The security app",
      "Signal has estimated 40-70 million monthly users - making it pretty tiny compared to the biggest messaging services, WhatsApp and Messenger, which count their customers in the billions.",
      "Where it does lead the way though is in security.",
      "At the core of that is end-to-end encryption (E2EE).",
      "Simply put, it means only the sender and the receiver can read messages - even Signal itself cannot access them.",
      "A number of other platforms also have E2EE -  including WhatsApp - but Signal's security features go beyond this.",
      "For example, the code that makes the app work is open source - meaning anybody can check it to make sure there are no vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.",
      "Its owners say it collects far less information from its users, and in particular does not store records of usernames, profile pictures, or the groups people are part of.",
      "There is also no need to dilute these features to make more money: Signal is owned by the Signal Foundation, a US-based non-profit, which relies on donations rather than ad revenue.",
      "\"Signal is the gold standard in private comms,\" said its boss Meredith Whittaker in a post on X after the US national security story became public.",
      "'Very, very unusual'",
      "That \"gold standard claim\" is what makes Signal appealing to cybersecurity experts and journalists, who often use the app.",
      "But even that level of security is considered insufficient for very high level conversations about extremely sensitive national security matters.",
      "That is because there is a largely unavoidable risk to communicating via a mobile phone: it is only as secure as the person that uses it.",
      "If someone gains access to your phone with Signal open - or if they learn your password - they'll be able to see your messages.",
      "And no app can prevent someone peeking over your shoulder if you are using your phone in a public space.",
      "Trump backs top adviser who accidentally added journalist to secret air strike chat",
      "Why is it a problem if Yemen strike plans shared on Signal?",
      "Data expert Caro Robson, who has worked with the US administration, said it was \"very, very unusual\" for high ranking security officials to communicate on a messaging platform like Signal.",
      "\"Usually you would use a very secure government system that is operated and owned by the government using very high levels of encryption,\" she said.",
      "She said this would typically mean devices kept in \"very secure government controlled locations\".",
      "The US government has historically used a sensitive compartmented information facility (Scif - pronounced \"skiff\") to discuss matters of national security.",
      "A Scif is an ultra-secure enclosed area in which personal electronic devices are not allowed.",
      "\"To even access this kind of classified information, you have to be in a particular room or building repeatedly swept for bugs or any listening devices,\" said Ms Robson.",
      "Scifs can be found in places ranging from military bases to the homes of officials.",
      "\"The whole system is massively encrypted and secured using the government's own highest standards of cryptography,\" she said.",
      "\"Especially when defence is involved.\"",
      "Encryption and records",
      "There's another issue tied to Signal that has raised concerns - disappearing messages.",
      "Signal, like many other messaging apps, allows its users to set messages to disappear after a set period of time.",
      "The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg said some of the messages in the Signal group he was added to disappeared after a week.",
      "This may violate laws around record-keeping - unless those using the app forwarded on their messages to an official government account.",
      "This is also far from the first row involving E2EE",
      "Various administrations have wanted to create a so-called backdoor into messaging services that use it so they can read messages they think might pose a national security threat.",
      "Apps including Signal and WhatsApp have previously fought attempts to create such a backdoor, saying it would eventually be used by bad actors.",
      "Signal threatened to pull the app from the UK in 2023 if it was undermined by lawmakers.",
      "This year, the UK government became embroiled in a significant row with Apple, which also uses E2EE to protect certain files in cloud storage.",
      "Apple ended up pulling the feature in the UK altogether after the government demanded access to data protected in this way by the tech giant.",
      "The legal case is ongoing.",
      "But, as this controversy shows, no level of security or legal protection matters if you simply share your confidential data with the wrong person.",

      "\"If you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox\": with that advice in an exclusive BBC interview, the hugely popular gaming platform's CEO Dave Baszucki ignited a fierce debate among parents.",
      "Mr Baszucki also stressed the company took protecting its users extremely seriously  and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on what is the UK's most popular gaming site for children aged eight to 12.",
      "Hundreds of people got in touch with the BBC after reading his comments: many said parents needed to take more responsibility, or highlighted how safe and enjoyable Roblox was for their children.",
      "Others painted a much darker picture - accusations of grooming, addiction and a company that failed to respond to their concerns.",
      "Here are some of their stories. The BBC has changed some names to protect the identities of young people.",
      "The boy 'addicted' to Roblox",
      "For Amir, from Leeds, Mr Baszucki's comments were \"ridiculous\", and the course of action he suggested was \"much easier said than done\".",
      "\"Roblox is ruining my son\", he told the BBC - and he feels powerless to stop it.",
      "A user since he was eight or nine, he says the 15-year-old is \"addicted\" and can now use the site for up to 14 hours a day.",
      "\"He is a single child and both parents are so busy working. I feel guilty we haven't been able to give him quality time. That's been robbed by Roblox,\" Amir told the BBC.",
      "The son's account is linked to the father's email address, and Amir has received \"hundreds\" of emails over the years from Roblox about the violation of the 'terms of use'.",
      "He says his son has been given temporary bans, but finds a way to play on - using multiple accounts and the accounts of others.",
      "Amir hopes he can reduce his son's time on the platform by \"playing cards, talking and watching YouTube together\" rather than forcing him off the platform completely.",
      "In response, Roblox highlighted to BBC News the screen time limit feature on the platform that gives parents the ability to restrict the amount of time children are allowed to spend on Roblox each day.",
      "'My nine-year-old girl was groomed on Roblox'",
      "Sally, from the north of Scotland, told the BBC she \"fully takes responsibility\" as a parent - but questioned whether Roblox was doing the same.",
      "She told the BBC her nine-year-old daughter was being groomed on Roblox and - despite reporting it to the platform - did not get a response, leaving her \"enraged\".",
      "The mother said last December her child was chatting to someone in a game where you can \"mimic real life\". This user coerced her child to role play \"marriage\". They told the girl they were touching themselves, and asked Sally's daughter to touch herself and take a photo.",
      "They offered Roblox's in-game currency in exchange for the picture. The child didn't do it, and told her mother days later.",
      "\"When she approached me, it was with a lot of tears, and feeling very, very shameful with what had happened. I assured my child that it's not their fault that they have done everything correct - to tell me.",
      "\"This is unacceptable for a platform that's advertised towards young children. It seems like the company isn't taking any responsibility and clearly their filters are not working.\"",

      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "In his BBC interview, Mr Baszucki said building a \"trust and safety system\" had been an important part of Roblox ever since it launched.",
      "He added: \"We do, in the company, take the attitude that any bad - even one bad incident - is one too many.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "He said he remained confident in Roblox's safety tools and insisted the firm went above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "Roblox also says it analyses all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so - and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "It stressed to BBC News that users cannot share images with each other on the platform.",
      "Concerns about children being exposed to sexual content on Roblox have been aired before.",

      "Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.",
      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

      "\"The US administration could see they were heading for PR catastrophe,\" political analyst Noa Redington said.",

      "A mere two days after Usha Vance's trip was announced, the cultural itinerary was dropped, replaced by a single visit to a remote US military installation - Pituffik Space Base. And now, Vice-President Vance would be joining his wife.",
      "Waltz was no longer listed on the itinerary, though he was added again later.",
      "\"Leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" JD Vance said, announcing his visit. \"That's been bad for Greenland. It's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction.\"",
      "Despite his comments, political leaders in Denmark cautiously welcomed the change of plan, and especially the limiting of the itinerary to just the US base.",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said that while the vice-president's presence may increase the formality of the visit, it was actually \"masterful spin\" which made the US \"look like they're escalating when they're actually deescalating.\"",
      "\"I actually think it is very positive that the Americans are cancelling their visit to the Greenlandic community. Then they will instead make a visit to their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,\" he said.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking US official to ever visit Greenland and while the limited scope of the trip has pleased Denmark, the fact that he is going at all underscores the high level of interest the Trump administration has in the island.",
      "The US president himself has continued to reiterate his desire to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, saying on Wednesday that the US will \"go as far as we have to go\" to accomplish that goal.",
      "According to Michael Williams, a professor of international politics at Ottawa University, Trump's focus on Greenland appears to reflect a larger international strategy that involves exerting US influence over key territories within its sphere of geographic influence.",
      "Canada and Greenland, both early targets of interest for the administration, occupy key Arctic waterways that are being contested by other global powers, like Russia and China.",
      "Recent US moves could be viewed as an attempt to gain the upper hand in these strategic North Americans regions.",
      "\"You want to amp up the American presence in the north and its control over those northern reaches,\" Williams said.",
      "\"If you can do that, then you can actually potentially control those northern waters in a much, much more direct way than has ever been necessary before.\"",
      "Attempts by superpowers to exert influence on less powerful nations echo the Cold War, when the US and Soviet Union faced off in global ideological competition.",
      "But the focus of these efforts were typically non-aligned nations, not America's closest allies and neighbours.",
      "While the Vances' trip to Greenland may be scaled back, America's larger designs on the island do not appear to have diminished. Any sigh of relief in Copenhagen may be short-lived.",
      "Vance's visit to the Pituffik Space Base suggests a narrower focus on American security and military matters. The shortest route for Russian nuclear missiles to reach the US runs through Greenland, and Pituffik plays a crucial role in US missile defence.",
      "\"I'm sure he'll say the security of Greenland is not safe in the hands of Denmark,\" Redington said, adding this would \"put even more pressure on the Danish government\".",

He argued that electing his rival Peter Dutton would be a step backwards for the country.",

Climate action - the feature of the last election - remains important to many Australians too.",

      "Watch: The BBC's Anthony Zurcher on Trump's negotiating tactics",
      "Six things that could get more expensive under new taxes",
      "The fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Trump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be \"absolutely no tariff\".",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.",
      "While the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad.",
      "The firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.",
      "Mexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany.",
      "Analysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group.",
      "German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must \"respond firmly\".",
      "\"It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence,\" he added.",
      "France backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products.",
      "At a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was \"not the time\" for the US to be imposing tariffs.",
      "\"Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs,\" he said in Paris.",
      "\"All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry,\" he added, urging Trump to reconsider.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \"direct attack\" on his country and its car industry, adding it \"will hurt us\", but trade options were being discussed.",
      "In the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was \"not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing\".",
      "Uniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were \"a gift to the Chinese\", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives.",
      "Meanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules.",
      "\"There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs,\" a spokesman for the foreign ministry said.",
      "There are warnings from Japan that there will be a \"significant impact\" on the economic relationship it shares with the US. A government spokesman described the measures as \"extremely regrettable\" and said officials had asked the US for an exemption.",
      "In South Korea, a day before the latest levy, Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US and build a new steel plant in Louisiana.",
      "Trump hailed the investment as a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\".",
      "Bosch - based in Germany - said it had confidence in the \"long-term potential\" of the North American market and would continue to expand its business there.",
      "The International Monetary Fund said it was not projecting a US recession, but warned a trade war could have a \"significant adverse effect\" on Canada and Mexico's economic outlooks.",

    "summary": "The former police officer was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of Clare Nowland.",
    "story": [
      "A former police officer has been spared a jail sentence over his fatal decision to Taser a 95-year-old woman with dementia symptoms at an Australia aged care home.",
      "Kristian White said he had used the weapon to prevent a \"violent confrontation\" after finding Clare Nowland disoriented and holding a small kitchen knife in May 2023.",
      "But the officer was found guilty of manslaughter by a jury last November, after prosecutors argued his actions towards the great-grandmother, who later died of her injuries, were \"grossly disproportionate\".",
      "The case sparked public outcry, with the judge at one point saying it was \"unlike any other that I have had to confront\" over nearly two decades on the bench.",
      "Handing down his sentence in the New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court on Friday, Justice Ian Harrison said White's actions at Yallambee Lodge in the town of Cooma, near Canberra, were a \"terrible mistake\".",
      "The \"obvious\" reality was that Mrs Nowland was a \"frail and confused 95-year-old woman\" who \"posed nothing that could reasonably be described as a threat of any substance\".",
      "\"The simple but tragic fact would seem to me to be that Mr White completely - and on one available view inexplicably - misread and misunderstood the dynamics of the situation,\" Mr Harrison said.",
      "The trial heard White was called to the care home around 04:00 on 17 May 2023, after Mrs Nowland was seen ambling around the premises with two serrated steak knives.",
      "Body cam footage showed he warned Mrs Nowland to drop the blades while aiming his weapon at her, before saying \"bugger it\" and firing. She fell and hit her head, triggering a fatal brain bleed.",
      "The defence highlighted evidence from one of the paramedics and White's police partner who both said Mrs Nowland had made them feel scared for their safety.",
      "But prosecutors had argued Mrs Nowland - who weighed under 48kg (105lb) and used a walker to get around - did not pose a threat and the officer was \"impatient\", using his weapon just three minutes after confronting her.",
      "Mrs Nowland's family, at a sentencing hearing last month, said White's \"unfathomable\" and \"inhumane\" actions had forever changed their lives.",
      "\"To this day I am traumatised by this gutless coward act,\" Michael Nowland, Clare's eldest son, told the court.",
      "White previously told the court he didn't think Mrs Nowland would be \"significantly injured\" and that he was \"devastated\" by her death.",
      "In a letter of apology to her relatives, White wrote: \"I deeply regret my actions and the severe consequences they have caused, to not only Mrs Nowland, but also to your family and the greater community.\"",
      "Justice Harrison said a jail term was not necessary, given White had already lost his job and become an unwelcome member of the local community, and did not pose a risk of reoffending.  He added it would also be difficult for a former officer to live in prison.",
      "He sentenced White to a community corrections order of two years - essentially a good behaviour bond - and 425 hours of community service.",
      "Speaking outside court, Mr Nowland said his family was disappointed.",
      "\"A slap on the wrist for someone that's killed our mother,\" he said. \"It's very, very hard to process that.\"",
      "\"Justice and fairness, that's all we wanted.\"",
      "Mrs Nowland's death sparked global outrage and drew scrutiny over NSW Police's use of force.",
      "White had served as a police officer with the NSW police for 12 years before he was removed after his conviction.",
      "Commissioner Karen Webb described the death as \"a terrible tragedy\" that shouldn't have happened, but stressed that the force's Taser and training policies are appropriate."

Back then, KCNA said Pyongyang would work \"proactively\" towards \"introducing artificial intelligence technology\" into the weapons.",

      "\"North Korea is hinging very clearly on a drone future for its military,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"The issue is whether or not these algorithms are robust enough, secure enough, advanced enough to make decisions that don't escalate the delicate security situation on the Korean peninsula.\"",
      "He said it was likely Russian assistance went into developing the drone.",

The Atlantic editor also became the prime target for every senior Trump administration official in Washington.",

They did not seem to notice his presence.",

It's popular among journalists and government officials. An account under Waltz's name had messaged him, which he assumed was a hoax.",

      "\"Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera - we felt like, hm, we disagree,\" he said. \"They're saying that, and we're the ones who have the texts, so maybe people should see them.\"",
      "There are text messages in the group chat - sent before the first wave of strikes - detailing exactly when F-18 fighter jets would take off, when the first bombs would drop on Houthi targets and when Tomahawk missiles were going be fired. Hegseth has pushed back, saying they were clearly not \"war plans\" and none of it was classified information.",
      "President Trump expressed his support for Hegseth on Wednesday, saying he was \"doing a great job\" and describing Goldberg as a \"sleazebag\". The White House has also attempted to argue that the information shared was not technically war planning.",

      "This isn't the first time that the veteran editor has been on the receiving end of Trump's ire: in 2020 he published a piece in The Atlantic where senior military officials quoted Trump as having referred to fallen American soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers\", something the president and his administration have vigorously denied.",
      "I asked him how he felt about the vitriolic personal attacks against him, coming from the very highest levels of the government.",
      "\"This is their move. You never defend, just attack,\" Goldberg said. \"So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I don't even get it.\"",
      "Trump has, so far, been defending his national security team and doesn't seem inclined to sack anyone over what he is calling a press \"witch-hunt\". But Goldberg says there's a widespread feeling in the White House that Waltz made a serious error, as well as deeper concern about how the incident is being handled.",
      "\"If you're a Air Force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that they've obviously mishandled sensitive information? You'd be fired, you'd be prosecuted,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He said there is now some \"buzz\" among the ranks around the apparently differing accountability standards for leaders in the Trump administration.",
      "Goldberg didn't stick around in the chat for the fallout. He decided the responsible thing to do was to leave the group. Some journalists have expressed incredulity that he would voluntarily exit.",
      "But what happens next will play out in the White House and Congress, where Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have demanded an investigation.",
      "\"There's a part of me that would love to see what else is happening in there. But there's a lot of different issues here related to law and ethics and all kinds of other issues that I really can't go into, \" Goldberg said. \"Believe me when I say that I made that decision with good advice from various parties.\"",

      "Tusk had said it would be adopted \"without a moment's delay\" while Duda said the changes were needed to strengthen security on the country's borders.",

      "\"We need Greenland for international safety and security,\" Trump added.",

      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that the decision was \"very positive\" and that Denmark had \"nothing against\" the Americans visiting their own base.",

      "He said the visit to the military installation was to check on the island's security, as \"a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland\".",
      "He added that the Trump administration wanted to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland\", and that the United States and Denmark have ignored it for \"far too long\".",

      "He said it was \"highly unusual\" that a high-level delegation of US officials are visiting Greenland without being invited, especially after a national election in the country, where the parties are still in talks to form the next government.",
      "The US' interest in Greenland's security, given its strategic importance, makes sense, he said. But he added that it is \"inexplicable\" for Washington DC to have taken such an aggressive approach, especially in light of Trump's comments about acquiring the territory.",

      "The problem, he and others argue, is that China's one-party state imposes decisions from the top. While this is effective for economic growth, it yields poor results in competitive team sports.",
      "Although Fifa prohibits state interference, Chinese football is rife with political appointments. This is common in China, where the Party controls most aspects of public life.",
      "The current president of the CFA, Song Cai, is also a Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party. His work, in turn, is overseen by a senior government official at the GAS.",
      "\"Everything has to report upwards to Communist Party bosses. It basically means that non-football people are making football decisions,\" Mr Dreyer says. \"Football has to be grassroots-led. You start at the bottom of the pyramid and the talent starts to funnel up to the top.\"",
      "All major footballing nations have a \"pyramid\" of leagues. The elite professional clubs sit at the top, supported by a deep pool of semi-professional and amateur teams, all of whose players are vying to work their way up.",
      "Such a pyramid thrives on a culture of playing football, en masse, for fun. The larger the pool to draw from, the better the players at the top will be.",
      "\"If you look at every country where football is really successful, the sport has grown organically as a grassroots activity over the past 100 years,\" Mr Simons says. \"Professional football in China has continually failed because it's supported by nothing - their pyramid is upside down.\"",
      "The statistics bear this out: England's 1.3 million registered players dwarf China's fewer-than-100,000 footballers. This is in spite of China's population being 20 times larger than England's.",
      "\"Kids here don't grow up with a ball at their feet. Without that, you're not going to produce elite talent,\" Mr Dreyer says.",
      "Top-level football in Europe and South America traces its origins to streets and parks in every town and village. In China, however, the push began in Beijing.",
      "It wasn't until the 1990s that the government set up the country's first professional league. It created a handful of top clubs in major cities - but neglected the grassroots.",
      "Keen to impress their bosses, officials in this top-down system inevitably opt for a \"short-termist\" approach that sacrifices genuine improvement over time for quick fixes, Mr Dreyer explains.",
      "Some foreigners who have played in China say such a heavily controlled system also leaves little room for young players to develop a natural understanding of the game.",
      "A European currently playing in China, who did not wish to reveal his name, told the BBC that while many Chinese players are \"technically good\", they lack \"football IQ\" at crucial moments on the pitch.",
      "\"Creativity and basic decision-making, which we learn instinctively as a kid, you don't see so much here,\" the player says.",
      "'I'm very sorry': A dream shattered",
      "This does not mean that there is not a deep love for football in China.",
      "While the men's team, currently ranked 90th in the world, is seen as a constant disappointment, the women's team, ranked 17th, has been a source of pride for years.",
      "Many in China have referred to them as the \"real\" guozu or national team - and in 2023, a record 53 million people tuned in to watch them play - and lose 6-1 - to England at the World Cup.",
      "The men's Super League boasts the highest average attendance of any league in Asia. At its peak in the 2010s, it was attracting big-name foreign players as it rode a wave of investment from state-owned enterprises, buoyed by a thriving economy.",
      "But it was short-lived.",
      "Since the pandemic and the subsequent economic slowdown in China, more than 40 professional clubs have folded as state-backed companies started to pull their investments. Private companies, too, have proved fickle in their commitment.",
      "In 2015, the Suning Appliance Group, which also used to own the top Italian club Inter Milan, bought Jiangsu FC. The club went on to win the Super League in 2020. But months later, Suning said they were closing the club to focus on their retail business.",
      "The demise of Guangzhou Evergrande, China's most successful team ever, is yet another example.",
      "Bankrolled by property giant Evergrande Group, they won trophy after trophy under the management of Italian greats such as Marcello Lippi and Fabio Cannavaro. But as they found glory at home and in Asia, their parent company was overstretching itself in an inflated property market.",
      "Evergrande is now the world's most indebted property company and the poster-child for China's real estate crisis, with arrears of more than $300bn (\u00a3225bn).",
      "Its former club - now in the hands of new owners - was expelled from the league in January. After years of splurging, the eight-time champions are still struggling to pay off their debt.",
      "But that is not the only crisis engulfing Chinese football. Its rapid rise created another problem: corruption.",
      "\"I should have followed the right path. I was just doing what was customary at the time,\" says Li Tie, the former manager of China's national men's team, in a 2024 documentary.",
      "In that documentary, Li makes a shocking admission: for years he fixed matches and paid bribes to get certain jobs, including 3m yuan (\u00a3331,000, $418,500) to become the national team coach in 2019.",
      "Dressed in all-black, he marks a written confession with an inky fingerprint: \"I'm very sorry.\"",
      "China's national team was made to watch the documentary by state broadcaster CCTV while preparing for last year's Asian Cup in Qatar.",
      "The primetime expose, co-produced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), was the first episode of a four-part series on corruption in China called Continued Efforts, Deepening Progress.",
      "In it, dozens of Chinese officials confess - always to camera - to staggering levels of corruption across a variety of industries.",
      "By airing the football episode first, the authorities signalled their serious concern about graft within the sport.",
      "Li, who appeared in a World Cup and once played for Premier League side Everton, is the most high-profile figure to have been apprehended last year in an unprecedented slew of anti-corruption arrests in Chinese football.",
      "In December, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail.",
      "Also publicly shamed in the documentary are former CFA chairman Chen Xuyuan and ex-deputy director of the GAS, Du Zhaocai.",
      "\"The corruption of these officials has broken our hearts,\" one fan told CCTV. \"I'm not surprised,\" said another.",
      "The documentary echoed what one ex-national team player told a BBC radio documentary in 2015 in an anonymous interview: that there was a system of \"open bidding\" among players for their spot in the squad.",
      "\"I could have won many more caps, but I didn't have the cash,\" he said.",
      "It would take another 10 years before corruption in football exploded into the spotlight. Some suggest this was prompted by China's intolerably bad performances on the pitch.",
      "The struggles of China's men's football team are all the more stark given how other sports are flourishing in the country.",
      "Decades of investment in infrastructure and training have taken China from a sporting backwater to a medal-winning machine that recently equalled the United States with 40 golds at the Paris Olympics.",
      "But many of these are individual sports - weightlifting, swimming, diving -  which require fewer resources and, crucially, less emphasis on community-led grassroots efforts, compared to a game like football.",
      "They are also less lucrative and, therefore, less vulnerable to corruption and mismanagement.",
      "As China's economy reels from a sustained downturn, its officials have bigger challenges than football woes.",
      "But that is little consolation to fans.",
      "The loss to Japan particularly stung. While Japan have gone from strength to strength over the past two decades, China have failed to qualify for a single World Cup.",
      "The day after the loss, the Oriental Sports Daily did not mince its words: \"When the taste of bitterness reaches its extreme, all that is left is numbness.\"",
      "According to Mr Dreyer, Japan's approach is antithetical to China's: a long-term vision, a lack of political interference and a commercially savvy club structure.",
      "\"Even so, the fan culture here [in China] is still remarkably good,\" he adds. \"They deserve so much more.\"",
      "Their disappointment showed following Tuesday's defeat against Australia - but so did their humour.",
      "\"It seems like the national team's performance is as consistent as ever,\" wrote one fan on social media. Another joked that if China wants to continue thriving economically, then its football team must suffer so there is a balance in \"national fortune\".",
      "Perhaps they had resigned themselves to what a popular Chinese journalist had written in his blog after Japan beat China.",
      "Football \"cannot be boosted by singing odes or telling stories\", he noted. \"It needs skill, and physical and tactical training. It cannot be accomplished through politics.\"",

    "story": [
      "By his own recognition, G\u00e9rard Depardieu acts in a world that is no longer his own.",
      "On day three of his sexual assault trial in Paris, the French cinema star admitted that he was given to \"rude\" and \"vulgar\" language no longer regarded as acceptable.",
      "It got to the point a few years ago, he said, where he insisted no female assistants should come near him in his dressing-room, because they were too liable to be shocked.",
      "\"Knowing the vulgarity of the old world, today I try to avoid being listened to by the new world \u2013 so that I don't come across as detestable,\" he told the court.",
      "\"I am not very much at ease with this new society... I think my time is done.\"",
      "But he denies being a sexual abuser.",
      "\"I don't see how it could be fun feeling up a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I am not a metro-train groper,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of sexual assault on two women on a film-set in 2021.  Both say he touched them on intimate parts of the body.",
      "In court the actor repeated his defence: that he may have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance, but that there was never any sexual intent.",
      "If convicted, Depardieu could face five years in jail and a fine of up to \u20ac75,000 (\u00a363,000; $81,000). The trial should continue until Thursday at least.",
      "Since Monday the packed courtroom has been the scene of explosive exchanges between the two legal teams \u2013 with Depardieu's lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous conducting an aggressive defence aimed at undermining the credibility of the two plaintiffs.",
      "But on Wednesday it was Depardieu who was subject to intense questioning, and at one point appeared to imply that a hand on a buttock did not constitute sexual assault.",
      "\"I never carried out an act of sexual assault [against a plaintiff]. Anyway sexual assault in my view is worse than what she has said,\" he said under questioning from the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt.",
      "Smelling blood, the lawyer swooped: \"You're saying that sexual assault has to be more than a hand on the buttocks?\"",
      "Out of his seat shot Depardieu's lawyer.",
      "\"No, that is not what my client said,\" he said, accusing Ms Durrieu-Diebolt of \"trying to create quotes that can be tweeted by the media.\"",
      "There is evidently no love lost between the two sides.",
      "Mr Assous is seen by the plaintiffs' team as deliberately setting out to bait them. He in turn believes that feminist \"activists\" have been at work on the plaintiffs, encouraging them to file charges that they might not otherwise have brought.",
      "The events under discussion took place in Paris in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an aging actor coming to terms with his declining powers.",
      "It is the first time the actor has appeared in court on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and he has also been accused of rape, all of which he has denied.",
      "The first plaintiff \u2013 a set decorator \u2013 told the court on Tuesday that after a minor argument with Depardieu he caught her between his legs, held her by the hips and told her obscenities.",
      "The second plaintiff \u2013 an assistant director \u2013 said she had been assaulted by the actor on three occasions. On the first, she had been accompanying him from his dressing-room to the set when she felt his hand on her buttock.",
      "Another time he touched her breasts through her clothes, and a third time the buttocks again. After she told her superior what had happened, Depardieu allegedly called her a \"snitch\" and refused to have her come near him.",
      "For the defense,  Mr Assous produced photographs taken at the end of the shoot showing Depardieu and the plaintiff apparently smiling happily together. She said she had wanted to play the incidents down, and that she was not even sure at the time if they had constituted a penal offence.",
      "It was only two years later when she had seen media coverage of Depardieu's alleged sexual misconduct in other cases that she had decided to lodge a complaint with police, she said.",
      "She added the affair had left her in a state of anxious distress, and still today she was having difficulty sleeping.",
      "The trial has offered a rare chance for the French public to see the once-revered actor - star of films like Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac - at close quarters.",
      "He appeared in court dressed in black shirt and jacket, and leaning on the shoulder of his very large bodyguard.",
      "The bodyguard \u2013 named as Massika - was referenced regularly in proceedings.",
      "Depardieu said Massika's permanent presence made it impossible for him to have carried out the sexual attacks of which he is accused.",
      "The actor is himself very overweight, and told the court he had difficulty walking more than a short distance.",
      "\"My joints all hurt. Basically my body is bust,\" he said.",
      "In the courtroom he sits on a special box that Massika brought with him.",
      "It is white, and covered in kiss-marks and signatures from people who have given Depardieu support.",

    "story": [
      "The head of Turkey's main opposition party has told the BBC that protests will continue \"in every city\" until either early presidential elections are called, or the jailed mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, is released from prison.",
      "Ozgur Ozel, chairman of the mayor's Republican People's Party (CHP), said the nationwide protests would include a very large demonstration this Saturday in Istanbul. That will open the party's campaign to make Imamoglu the country's next president in elections that are due in 2028, he said.",
      "\"In every city we go to, we will have the biggest rallies in their history,\" Ozel declared.",
      "\"The belief in Ekrem Imamoglu and in democracy will make the protests bigger and stronger,\" he told us at his party headquarters in Istanbul, as visitors, staff and advisors bustled in and out.",
      "The opposition has brought huge crowds onto the streets - the biggest seen here in over a decade - since Imamoglu was arrested seven days ago.",
      "Alongside the mass demonstrations, there have also been mass arrests - more than 1,400 people and counting, including seven Turkish journalists who were reporting on the protests.",
      "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has plenty of strong supporters, has condemned the demonstrations as \"street terrorism\" and accused protesters of attacking the police and damaging public property.",
      "He said the opposition's \"show\" would eventually fade.",
      "Ozel spoke to the BBC fresh from a visit to Silivri Prison, a high-security campus on the outskirts of Istanbul where Imamoglu is being held.",
      "\"He is in solitary confinement, but he's in good condition and has not been mistreated so far,\" he told us.",
      "Ozel said the corruption case against Istanbul's mayor was \"a scam designed to discredit him\".",
      "As an example, he cited allegations that Imamoglu bought land cheaply years ago, and the low purchase price may have been a bribe. \"The truth was that small payment was just the deposit for the land,\" he said.",

      "Protests are about far more than fate of Istanbul's mayor",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - Turkey's presidential hopeful who is under arrest",
      "Imamoglu denies all the charges against him, including \"establishing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, and rigging a public tender\".",
      "He says his arrest was a coup. Turkish officials say the courts here are independent. Human rights organisations strongly dispute that.",
      "Ozel said Imamoglu was arrested for one simple reason \u2013 to prevent him becoming Turkey's next president. Opinion polls suggest the mayor might be able to do that \u2013 if he's not behind bars.",
      "\"Erdogan has thrown a three-time election winner in jail\u2026 in front of the whole world,\" Ozel said.",
      "\"Suddenly he is jailing someone who is fighting against him in a normal political way. It's like your rival coming and slicing the ball in a football game, because you are winning.\"",
      "The opposition party believes the response of Turkish society and the international community will be key in deciding if Imamoglu remains behind bars.",
      "But Ozel said the CHP felt \"abandoned\" by the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his party.",
      "\"While all of Europe is reacting, the English Labour Party, and Starmer have said nothing. The cradle of democracy - England - and our brother party, the Labour party, how can they stay silent? We are really hurt.\"",
      "A few hours before that comment on Tuesday, Starmer's spokesman said that there was \"an ongoing domestic Turkish legal process\" and the UK \"expects Turkey to uphold the rule of law\".",
      "If the mayor is not released, the CHP plans to keep fighting for the presidency.",
      "\"If they keep Ekrem Imamoglu locked up and hinder his candidacy,\" Ozel said, \"any member of CHP can be a candidate and would be elected with 65% to 70%\"."

      "In total, 45 passengers were thought to have been on-board the submarine, called Sindbad, when it sank close to the harbour.",
      "Here is what we know so far.",
      "Who was on board?",
      "The Red Sea area governor, Amr Hanafy, said six tourists died and 39 further people were rescued after the submarine sank. No people are missing.",
      "He said the 45 passengers on board were from Russia, India, Norway and Sweden. There were also five Egyptians on board.",
      "All of those who died were from Russia. A Russian official in Hurghada, Viktor Voropaev, said that two of those killed were children. Authorities in the Russian republic of Tatarstan told Russian media that two others who died were married doctors.",
      "An earlier statement from the Russian embassy in Egypt had said all of the tourists on board were Russian.",
      "What was the submarine doing?",
      "The submarine, Sindbad, had been in operation as a tourist submarine for a number of years.",
      "According to the company running the tourist trips - Sindbad Submarines - its vessels take passengers on journeys to explore coral reefs near the Hurghada coastline.",
      "The company says it holds two of the only \"14 real recreational submarines\" in the world, which hold 44 seats for passengers and two seats for pilots.",
      "Tours are designed for both adults and children, the company's website says, and allow passengers to travel 25 metres (82 feet) underwater.",
      "Dr James Aldridge, who took the same trip on one of the company's submarines last month, said each passenger is given \"a seat on a cushion next to your window and there is a recorded safety brief in multiple languages\".",
      "The vessel \"wasn't cramped or overcrowded\", Dr Aldridge, from Bristol, said, adding that he \"never felt unsafe\".",
      "\"The sub departed and we toured the reef for 40 minutes,\" he said. \"For the first 20 I was facing the reef, the sub never strayed 'too close'.\"",
      "According to Dr Aldridge, the divers accompanying the submarine \"used fish food to attract the wildlife\" to keep the passengers entertained.",
      "Dr Aldridge said the submarine \"never went close\" to a 25-metre depth.",
      "He was not, however, issued a life jacket.",
      "Benjamin Grey, 50, from Camberley, also took a trip on a Sindbad submarine in February - but had quite a different experience.",
      "He boarded with his 13-year-old daughter and his partner, and said he noticed \"problems\" during the trip, including the submarine surfacing \"at least three times\".",
      "\"About halfway through there was a diver who looked like he'd picked up a rock,\" he said. \"He was banging something on the bottom of the submarine. Clearly at some point the submarine had stopped moving and the divers outside were doing something.\"",
      "He also said - in contrast to Dr Aldridge - that \"no safety procedures were talked through\".",
      "Where did the submarine sink?",
      "The submarine sank around one kilometre (0.6 miles) off the coast of the Egyptian Red Sea city of Hurghada, the BBC understands.",
      "The Russian embassy said it happened around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), about 0.6 miles (1km) from the shore.",
      "Hurghada is a popular tourist destination, with its coastline known for its beaches and coral reefs. A number of tourist trip companies operate out of its harbour.",
      "In recent years, there have been other incidents involving Red Sea tourist boats operating out of the city.",
      "In November, a tourist boat called the Sea Story sank, leaving 11 dead or missing - including a British couple - and 35 survivors. The BBC later heard accusations of safety failings on board.",
      "UK investigators said last month there had been 16 incidents involving \"liveaboard\" vessels in the area in the last five years, with a number resulting in deaths.",
      "How did the submarine sink?",
      "Authorities in Egypt are investigating the cause of the incident, and details are currently unclear.",
      "There continues to be a lot of activity from other boats around the harbour near where the submarine sank.",
      "Red Sea governor Amr Hanafy said the submarine had a valid licence and the crew leader had the correct \"scientific certificates\".",
      "It appeared that the weather was quite calm with no sign of any rough waters."

Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.",
      "Zelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to the dressing down he was given by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month.",
      "After their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.",
      "It was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration.",
      "He switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.",

      "Starmer announces 'coalition of the willing' to guarantee Ukraine peace",
      "But even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies.",
      "The evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all.",
      "Most European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States.",
      "American presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.",
      "Europe 'has discipline and no chaos'",
      "During the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe \u2013 led by the UK, France and Germany \u2013 to spend more on defence.",
      "He suggested that in three to five years, \"if everything goes as it is now\", Europe might even catch up with the United States.",
      "At best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.",

      "The European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\".",
      "Even Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career.",
      "He told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.",
      "\"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land.",
      "\"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone\u2026 And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.\"",
      "I asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.",
      "\"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.\"",
      "Zelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts.",
      "Trump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.",
      "He was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.",
      "\"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\"",
      "Witkoff falling for Moscow's 'narratives'",
      "That did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war.",
      "In an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine.",
      "The American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States.",
      "What if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.",
      "Zelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.",
      "\"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\"",
      "Zelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.",
      "\"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\"",
      "In it for 'long haul'",
      "President Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine.",
      "Zelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.",
      "I asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.",
      "\"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\"",
      "Zelensky laughed.",
      "\"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\"",
      "Trump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 03:00:45 GMT",
    "summary": "A cocktail of global and domestic conditions have complicated the government's run for a second term.",
    "story": [
      "When Cyclone Alfred barrelled over Australia's east coast earlier this month, it also blew the government's election plans off course.",
      "Hoping to capitalise on some rare good news on interest rates, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of announcing an April polling date. Instead he had to pivot and focus on responding to the natural disaster. It was, one Labor Minister told me, a decision taken from him by \"an act of God\".",
      "You might say that's been a theme of his government: big plans often derailed by unpleasant surprises \u2013 trying global economic conditions and a cost-of-living crisis which is battering many countries, foreign wars and tricky geopolitics, post-pandemic fallout and rising national divisions, and now giant storms.",
      "\"Global conditions are real,\" Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, said as he officially announced a 3 May election.",
      "Though, despite those challenges, he says his party has delivered. \"Landing where we have is like landing a 747 [jet] on a helicopter pad,\" he said, pointing to a recent increase in wage growth and falling inflation.",
      "But he wants a second term to reset.",
      "Standing in his way is Peter Dutton - a conservative who leads the Liberal Party, the dominant member of the so-called Coalition with the National Party of Australia \u2013 who just two years ago polling indicated was deeply unpopular.",
      "But the race between them is now so tight and the rise of independents or minor parties such that many are expecting a hung parliament.",
      "So how has it unravelled for Prime Minister Albanese?",
      "His victory in May 2022 was seen as a fresh start after nine years of conservative rule.",
      "Climate action was big on the agenda, as was addressing the cost-of-living and restoring stability to the country's leadership.",
      "But the legacy he eyed for his government was on Indigenous affairs. He opened his victory speech reiterating a pledge to hold a historic referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, an advisory body that would inform the government on issues that affect First Nations people.",
      "Albanese spent most of 2023 campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote. This was the moment, he hoped, that First Nations people would get constitutional recognition - finally catching up with other former British colonies - and that Australia would begin mending what many see as a very broken relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",
      "But the proposal was decisively rejected, leaving many Indigenous people feeling disappointed and betrayed. Albanese was also left licking his wounds after a damaging campaign.",
      "Some critics blamed confusion and misinformation for why about 60% of Australians voted \"No\". But while Albanese was campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote, opposition leader Peter Dutton campaigned for \"No\", attacking Albanese for spending money on the referendum while a cost-of-living crisis intensified.",
      "\"[Dutton] not only won on the referendum, but also he won on positioning Labor as the government that's not completely focused on the issues that matter to Australia,\" says Kos Samaras, political consultant and a former Labor strategist.",
      "During Albanese's tenure, interest rates have been put up 12 times (and cut once, in February), inflation soared post-pandemic, the country's housing crisis deepened, and Australians increasingly felt stretched.",
      "Hurt ripples in wake of Indigenous Voice vote",
      "Has Australia cleaned up its act on climate?",
      "Though the prime minister would lay the blame for many of those issues at the previous coalition government's feet, voters want to know who is best placed to deal with all of them now.",
      "In Anthony Albanese's victory speech in 2022, he said Australia was \"the greatest country on earth\". Australian voters though are increasingly questioning whether that's still true \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, whether politicians from traditional parties are the ones able to fix it.",
      "So though many are disillusioned with Labor, this won't necessarily translate as a vote for Dutton's Coalition at the ballot box.",
      "Support for minor parties and independents reached record levels at the previous election, and similar is expected this time around. If neither party reaches the magic number of 76 seats in the House of Representatives, which poll after poll paints as unlikely, independent candidates could be the kingmakers of any future government.",
      "If that happens, Australia would be another page in a story unfolding all over the world - disenfranchised voters seeking more radical solutions and voting for change. In many places this is a real threat to democracy as people stop trusting the system.",
      "But while Australia faces the same challenges as other parts of the world, a few quirks in its electoral system have thus far guarded against more radical swings that we've seen in other countries, like the US, France and Germany.",
      "Experts all agree that mandatory voting is a key factor in Australia's political stability. In the 2022 elections, just under 90% of the population voted \u2013 much, much higher than the average OECD turnout of 69%. The fine for not voting in a federal election is a mere A$20 but there's a sense of duty here to go out and vote.",
      "What that means is politicians don't have to mobilise their bases \u2013 turnout is a given, it's just about pushing your narrative. Where voting is optional, there's a tendency for special interest groups to become overly influential as those who are less engaged decide not to cast a ballot. Plus, if everyone, no matter their politics, education or their wealth, goes to vote, it tends to pull the result towards a more representative centre.",
      "\"[Australia's] elections are decided in the middle,\" says the country's chief election analyst Antony Green. \"That means getting your message through those people who aren't paying much attention.\"",
      "The moment that changes Australia",
      "\u2018Not my King\u2019 protest row highlights Australian divisions",
      "The other big stabiliser for Australia, say experts, is preferential voting \u2013 where voters effectively number their candidates in order of who they want to win. It's why in recent years the Greens have emerged on the left and One Nation on the right but still, Labor and the Coalition dominate. Experts say preferential voting tempers the effects of polarisation and forces the two major parties to appeal to people who aren't necessarily voting for them first in order to receive their next preferences, which also helps moderate policy.",
      "While the campaign will focus on problems close to home, the candidates would be foolish to ignore the global political headwinds.",
      "During last year's presidential election, few analysts I spoke to seemed to think a Trump White House would massively impact Australia, this comparatively small and distant democracy.",
      "But five months feels like a lifetime in today's politics. Not a day goes by without Donald Trump making the headlines and Australians are tuning in to watch.",
      "With Trump's obvious disregard for longstanding alliances as well as constant talk of tariffs and trade wars, all this plays a part in Australians' fears about their place in the world \u2013 and importantly, the future of what is arguably its most important diplomatic and military relationship.",
      "Peter Dutton argues he'd be much better than Albanese at dealing with Trump. But there are doubts that anyone really knows how to handle this new administration \u2013 politicians of all stripes around the globe are feeling their way with how best to manage their relationship with the US.",
      "Allies unveil new details of nuclear submarine deal",
      "The laidback Australian city key to countering China",
      "With Albanese firing the starting gun today, Australians have just over a month of intense campaigning to help them determine who they want to lead them through the next three years.",
      "While Labor's handling of the ex-cyclone Alfred has improved its chances \u2013 the Prime Minister's approval ratings have risen to their highest level in 18 months \u2013 polling in recent months has pointed towards a Dutton administration.",
      "It's still incredibly close, and the Albanese government faces the unenviable prospect of being the first which fails to win a second term since 1931."

    "summary": "Affluent, urban Indians indulging their dogs and cats have led to the growth of India's pet care sector.",
    "story": [
      "For Neha Bapna, nothing in the world is more important than her dog Muffin.",
      "Every time she takes a train to travel across India, the four-year-old Shih Tzu is right by her side - in first class. He only eats hypoallergenic food, which is often double the price of normal dog food and treats.",
      "\"I have spent sleepless nights trying to figure out what food suits him. He is my child, I do not want him to have any trouble,\" says the 43-year-old Mumbai-based entrepreneur.",
      "Pampering one's pet used to be a luxury exclusive to the ultra-rich. But now affluent and middle-class urban Indians like Ms Bapna are splurging more on their \"fur babies\", fuelling a boom in India's pet care industry that has almost doubled in value in recent years.",
      "The pandemic has played a huge role, according to Ankur Bisen, senior partner at Technopak retail consultancy.",
      "\"Covid created a need for companionship when people were staying at home. So you could see young mothers, people in their first jobs, people who by choice decided not to have kids... All these people started going for pet ownership,\" he says.",
      "The number of pets in Indian households has grown sharply from 26 million in 2019 to 32 million in 2024, according to a report by consulting firm Redseer.",
      "And as late marriages, smaller family sizes and evolving social norms reshape family structures in urban India, these pets are increasingly being given the care and attention typically reserved for children.",
      "Nikhil Bhushan and Lakshna Gulati, who live in the capital, Delhi, say raising their pets allows them to experience parenthood without complexity.",
      "The couple, who have no biological children, share their home with two rescued pets: a dog named Mowgli and a cat named Marmalade.",
      "\"When we got married five years ago, we weren't ready to have children, but soon after rescuing the pets, our house truly became a home \u2013 there was something missing which is now complete. They bring us joy and seeing them every day brightens our lives,\" says Mr Bhushan.",
      "\"We like to spoil them,\" adds Ms Gulati. \"Whenever we see [a toy] they might like, we immediately buy it, even knowing it will be destroyed in no time.\"",
      "In 2024, Indians spent $3.6bn (\u00a32.78bn) on products and services for their pets, a substantial increase from $1.6bn in 2019, according to the Redseer report.",
      "This rapid growth has been fuelled by emerging trends such as pet boarding, insurance and specialised veterinary care.",
      "\"Twenty years ago, pet care was limited to basic services like vaccination and veterinary care,\" says Pankaj Poddar, chief executive of pet care company Zigly.",
      "\"Now, people want the best for their pets - whether it's clothing, accessories, or even specialised services,\" he says. \"I have seen parents spend as much as 10% of their incomes on their pets - be it taking them to special parties or even regular checkups.\"",
      "Ms Bapna, for instance, spends between 25,000 rupees ($290; \u00a3220) and 40,000 rupees on Muffin in a month, mostly on his travel and special diet.",
      "She takes her dog on a trip every few weeks, whether it's a day outing to a nearby farmhouse or a longer stay at a resort, and stays in pet-friendly accommodation which are pricier than regular hotels.",
      "When she takes the train to Jodhpur every few months to visit her parents, Ms Bapna buys first-class tickets - which are more than double the price of general tickets - as dogs and cats in India are only allowed in first-class coaches.",
      "Ms Bapna doesn't mind the huge bills. When it comes to spending on Muffin, she says, \"This is one area where I make no concessions.\"",
      "This kind of spending has propelled sales for pet care companies like Zigly.",
      "\"In the last eight-to-nine months, we have grown between 7% and 10% month-on-month,\" says Mr Poddar, whose company has reached a monthly gross merchandise value of around 46m rupees per month and is expected to reach 1bn rupees by next year.",
      "More companies which offer cheaper services, such as pet care chain The Pet Point, have also sprung up to cater to the increasingly middle-class clientele.",
      "For most Indian pet parents these days, \"value for money takes precedence over premiumisation\", says The Pet Point's co-founder Akshay Mahendru. \"A customer is more likely to get grooming services for their pet every week for 600 rupees, rather than somewhere above 1,500 rupees.\"",
      "Mr Mahendru says that sales for comparatively cheaper pet products like toys or snacks has also increased manifold with the emergence of quick commerce platforms like Zepto or Blinkit that do deliveries in 10-15 minutes.",
      "Experts are optimistic that India's pet care market has room to grow, given global trends. According to Bloomberg Intelligence's Pet Economy Report 2023, the global pet care sector, currently valued at $320bn, could exceed $500bn by the end of this decade.",
      "Redseer's report estimates India's pet care market to double in the next three years and potentially cross $7bn by 2028.",
      "But challenges still remain.",
      "India continues to be dogged by unequal economic growth, slowing consumption and wage stagnation which can dampen the industry's growth.",
      "Most cities here also lack pet-friendly public spaces, hotels and transport options, presenting a multitude of inconveniences to pet parents.",
      "Whenever Mr Bhushan and Ms Gulati travel with Mowgli, they bring portable beds and disposable plates and bowls \"so we're always prepared during our stays\", says Mr Bhushan.",
      "\"However, problems arise when we go for meals during our trips. Many places do not accept pets, which limits our options,\" he adds.",
      "Ms Bapna faces similar challenges when travelling with Muffin. But she is optimistic that things will change.",
      "\"When I first got him in 2021, there were very few pet-friendly places and activities. But now in Mumbai there are special events, resorts and cafes that welcome pets,\" she said.",
      "These days Muffin gets to attend \"socialisation events\", where he gets to play with other dogs, or goes to pet festivals where he can play games and sample special pet food.",
      "\"It gives me hope,\" Ms Bapna says with a smile.",

    "summary": "Strong wind, dry land and pine trees are a dangerous combination for wildfires, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Strong winds, dense forest and unusually dry weather - that's the deadly combination that experts say is fuelling the largest wildfires in South Korea's history.",
      "The inferno in the south-east has burned through 35,810 hectares (88,500 acres) as of Thursday - that's about half the size of New York City - killing 27 people so far and displacing tens of thousands.",
      "Authorities believe the wildfires started by accident from human activity, but the main drivers of the devastation are dry land, and strong gusts sweeping over inland regions.",
      "The high concentration of pine forest in North Gyeongsang province, where the fires are burning, is also \"oiling\" the blaze, said a forest disaster expert.",
      "Vulnerable pine forests",
      "\"Pine trees contain resin, which acts like oil, intensifying fires when ignited. This resin causes wildfires to burn faster, stronger, and longer,\" said Lee Byung-doo from the National Institute of Forest Science in Seoul.",
      "Andong, one of the worst-hit cities, is known for its tranquil pine forests.",
      "While they provide shelter and food for local wildlife and sometimes help break the wind, pine trees \"become problematic during wildfires\", Mr Lee told the BBC.",
      "\"Because forests [in South Korea] contain large numbers of pine trees, the areas are particularly vulnerable when fires break out,\" he said.",
      "Furthermore, pine trees retain their needles throughout winter, making them susceptible to \"crown fires\" - wildfires that spread by igniting the dense canopy of branches and leaves. This has contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of the flames over the past week.",
      "Unlike neighbouring countries such as China and North Korea, South Korea has made gains in forest cover over recent years.",
      "\"Most mountains are now filled with fallen leaves and pine trees... This accumulation has become a significant factor in accelerating the spread of wildfire,\" says Baek Min-ho, a disaster prevention specialist at Kangwon National University.",
      "Climate change is also to blame, experts say.",
      "\"This wildfire has once again exposed the harsh reality of a climate crisis unlike anything we've experienced before,\" South Korea's disaster chief Lee Han-kyung said on Thursday.",
      "The ideal environment for these record blazes has been building for the past few weeks, which saw temperatures rise above 20C (68F), unusually high for spring. Analysis by Climate Central, which researches climate science, suggests that these high temperatures have been made up to five times more likely by global warming.",
      "The unusual heat dried out the land and air, allowing fires to spread more rapidly, especially when combined with strong winds.",
      "Dense tree cover and strong winds in the fire-hit region also pose substantial challenges to firefighting efforts.",
      "On Wednesday, a 73-year-old pilot died when his firefighting helicopter crashed in Uiseong county. At least three other firefighters have been killed in the blazes.",
      "Elderly residents in second-oldest province",
      "Most of the 26 people who died are in their 60s and 70s, officials say. South Korea is an ageing society, where one in five people are at least 65 years old.",
      "North Gyeongsang is its second-oldest province, which also explains the relatively high death toll - it is especially difficult to evacuate older people in a disaster because they may have mobility issues or other health risks.",
      "They may also have more difficulty accessing or interpreting evacuation orders.",
      "Three residents of an elderly care facility in Yeongdeok county died on Wednesday, when the car they were in went up in flames. Only one out of four in the vehicle managed to flee in time, the Korea JoongAng Daily reported.",
      "Acting President Han Duck-soo said on Thursday it was \"worrying\" that many of the victims are elderly, as he ordered the interior minister to relocate to North Gyeongsang to oversee relief efforts.",

      "\"No one in the village was prepared,\" said the woman, who asked not to be named.",
      "\"We had to leave with nothing, and all our belongings are gone. Many of the residents are elderly, so I hope the government can provide temporary shelters where people can stay comfortably,\" she said.",

      "The US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes.",
      "Vietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office.",
      "While some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach.",
      "Speaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it \"benefits\" his country, drawing laughter in the room.",
      "Would that work?",
      "'Bamboo' economics",
      "Trump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\".",
      "But he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico.",
      "Analysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans.",
      "\"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.",
      "\"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\"",
      "Vietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there.",
      "The government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis.",
      "Some analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs.",
      "Hanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\".",
      "It came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.",
      "Steve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".",
      "This strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.",
      "\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "What about China?",
      "One big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "Former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "However, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626e935llwo",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:44:43 GMT",
    "summary": "As the nation prepares to head to the polls on 3 May, here's a guide to its electoral system and what to watch.",
    "story": [
      "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022.",
      "The results will determine who the next prime minister will be, as well as the make-up of the nation's parliament.",
      "How does Australia's voting system work?",
      "Australia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18, the country uses preferential voting, and picking up a \"democracy sausage\" is a polling day custom.",
      "Almost 18 million people are registered to vote in this election - roughly 98% of those who are eligible.",
      "Unlike the First Past the Post system - used in the UK and most US states - which elects candidates based on who has received the greatest number of votes in a single count, regardless of whether they've secured an absolute majority - voters in Australia rank candidates in order of preference.",
      "If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are then redistributed, and that process repeated until someone secures a majority.",
      "In races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot.",
      "However, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences.",
      "It is the leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House who then becomes prime minister. There is no separate leadership ballot.",
      "Who is being elected?",
      "All of the seats in Australia's House of Representatives - that's 150 in this election -will be up for grabs, as will 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate.",
      "Australia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition.",
      "One party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.",
      "If it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs.",
      "In both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades.",
      "That reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties.",
      "Who is in power currently?",
      "Labor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception.",
      "As it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.",
      "But with one House seat abolished, if Labor loses just two seats at this election it will be stripped of its majority in parliament.",
      "In order to form a government in its own right, the coalition needs to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote.",
      "Who is in the running to be prime minister?",
      "Anthony Albanese has been the prime minister since the last election, and a stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years.",
      "While he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power in 2022, he has in recent times come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.",
      "Albanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader.",
      "Known as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.",
      "What are the key issues?",
      "Both the polling and the political messaging around this year's election indicate that cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters.",
      "Since the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched.",
      "The Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.",
      "However, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management - and that has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages across the country.",
      "Housing affordability will also be a key issue this election cycle, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers.",
      "The year the Australian Dream died",
      "Albanese faces headwinds ahead of Australian election",
      "When will we know the results?",
      "Historically, Australians are used to getting a result and knowing who will form government on election night.",
      "However, it is usually not the Australian Election Commission - the official body tasked with manually counting the votes - that declares this.",
      "Instead, the AEC provides what's known as an \"indicative count\" throughout the day, which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.",
      "The AEC does not formally declare a seat until it is confident the result will not change based on the number of uncounted votes, which can sometimes take days."

    "summary": "Fighting in a mineral-rich region of central Africa proves a quandary for Chinese business interests.",
    "story": [
      "China's efforts to build up huge business interests across Africa have been accompanied by a careful policy of maintaining neutrality - but the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has caused a shift in its approach.",
      "Rwanda has been widely accused of stoking the fighting in the mineral-rich region and Beijing, which has close relations with both DR Congo and Rwanda, has in recent weeks joined the criticism.",
      "But it is trying to walk a diplomatic tightrope to maintain good relations with both countries, while also continuing to operate its businesses - and buy crucial minerals.",
      "How is China's response to this conflict different?",
      "For decades, China has been careful not to take sides in conflicts in Africa, to avoid causing problems that might interfere with its extensive commercial interests.",
      "Up to now it has shied away from criticising African governments for supporting participants in a conflict.",
      "For example, China has said little about the series of coups since 2020 in West Africa's Sahel region, except to urge leaders to consider the interests of the people.",
      "Beijing has long pursued a policy of non-interference in another state's internal affairs, says Prof Zhou Yuyuan, who specialises in African development and security at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS).",
      "It therefore avoids proposing solutions to conflicts, apart from calling for diplomatic or political efforts by international organisations such as the UN or the African Union.",
      "The unrest involving Rwandan-back M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo reared its head again in 2021. The fighters are led by ethnic Tutsis who say they took up arms to protect the rights of the minority group - and because the Congolese authorities reneged on an earlier peace deal.",
      "In its early comments on these developments, China restricted itself to criticising unnamed \"foreign forces\" for providing support to the M23 fighters.",
      "But in the last few weeks it has broken from its usual practice and referred to Rwanda by name.",
      "This follows major gains by the M23, which since January has captured the key cities of Goma and Bukavu.",
      "\"China reiterates its hope that Rwanda will\u2026 stop its military support for M23 and immediately withdraw all its military forces from the DRC territory,\" China's UN ambassador said in February.",
      "Prof Zhou notes that though significant, the \"wording in general is still relatively mild\".",
      "\"China 'hoped' that Rwanda would stop its support but did not condemn it,\" he says.",
      "However, soon afterwards China backed a UN Security Council resolution which bluntly calls on the Rwanda Defence Forces to \"cease support to the M23 and immediately withdraw from DRC territory without preconditions\".",
      "Why has China made this shift?",
      "According to Prof Zhou, China's statements are likely to have been prompted by UN expert reports, which have provided strong evidence of Rwanda's support for the M23.",
      "\"This is a basic consensus in the UN Security Council,\" he added.",
      "\"The problem has been going on long enough, and everyone knows in their hearts the basic situation. There's no need to be hush-hush any more.\"",
      "Neither China's mission to the UN nor its embassy in London responded when asked why China had criticised Rwanda.",
      "But the critical importance to China of DR Congo's renowned mineral wealth may have been a factor.",
      "Fighting in eastern DR Congo has been concentrated in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, home to many Chinese-run gold mines.",
      "How these mines have been affected by the fighting is so far unclear.",
      "The M23 has also seized territory containing mines for coltan ore, which China imports in large volumes.",
      "The metal tantalum, used in cars and everyday electronics from TV sets to mobile phones, is extracted from this ore, and DR Congo is the source of 40% of the world's supply.",

      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",
      "A UN expert group said in December 2024 that the M23 had smuggled coltan to Rwanda from DR Congo. It also noted that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023.",
      "Although Rwanda has its own coltan mines, analysts say they could not account for such a large increase in production.",
      "It is not yet clear whether the volume or the price of coltan imported by China has been affected.",
      "Another mineral that China imports from DR Congo is cobalt, which is crucial for the lithium battery industry.",
      "However, China's cobalt mining operations are primarily based in southern DR Congo, away from the conflict zones in the east.",
      "Dozens of Chinese companies, many of which are state-owned, are also building roads, telecommunications and hydropower facilities in DR Congo. But it seems that the impact on these activities has so far been minimal.",
      "Does China provide military support to Rwanda or DR Congo?",
      "China's supplies weapons to both Rwanda and DR Congo.",
      "In the past two decades, the Rwandan military has bought Chinese armoured vehicles, artillery and anti-tank missiles, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).",
      "China posted a military attach\u00e9 to the country for the first time in 2024.",
      "While UN experts say the Rwandan military has armed the M23, it is unclear whether the rebel group is using any Chinese weapons.",
      "The Congolese armed forces have bought Chinese armoured personnel carriers and drones.",
      "They also own Chinese tanks, which were bought in 1976 but were still in use as recently as 2022.",
      "It is reported that the drones, at least, have been used in the fight against the M23.",
      "Have China's relations with either country been affected?",
      "The Rwandan embassy in Beijing said ties with China remained \"excellent and productive\", and it was not for Rwanda to comment on China's statement about the fighting in eastern DR Congo.",
      "The Chinese ambassador to DR Congo, Zhao Bin, held discussions with Congolese Senate President Sama Lukonde in early February but no details of the meeting were made public.",
      "China's economic activities in the two countries go very deep. They are both part of China's Belt and Road initiative, designed to stitch China closer to the world through investments and infrastructure projects.",
      "In Rwanda, China has funded stadiums, schools and highways. Chinese loans are also funding infrastructure projects - a loan to fund a dam and irrigation system, worth an estimated $40m (\u00a331m), was confirmed in January.",

    "summary": "Weak domestic consumption and muted export demand are restricting expansion plans, according to a report.",
    "story": [
      "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?",
      "It's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.",
      "After a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.",
      "Analysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.",
      "Over the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments.",
      "Banking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.",
      "Data from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments.",
      "So why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?",
      "Weak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.",
      "But beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.",
      "Slowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.",
      "Investments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.",
      "India's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.",
      "With all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.",
      "According to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.",
      "Key to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.",
      "The government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.",
      "But none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.",
      "According to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.",
      "India's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.",
      "\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.",
      "Rathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.",
      "\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.",
      "He said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.",
      "\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.",
      "But things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.",
      "Interest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.",
      "India's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen.",
      "The uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.",

    "story": [
      "A discussion by high-ranking US security officials about US air strikes on Yemen has been published in full by the Atlantic magazine.",
      "The group chat on the Signal app mistakenly included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.",
      "After holding back some excerpts of the chat in an earlier article, he decided on Wednesday to publish almost the entire exchange after senior officials insisted there was no classified information shared in the group.",
      "Those statements \"have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions\", Goldberg wrote.",
      "The messages, however, need some unpicking. Here are three of them with some analysis.",
      "Timetable for the attack",
      "These messages provide details of the US military's plan for the Yemen strikes - described as a \"package\", a military term which refers to a set of aircraft, weapons systems and intelligence gathering devices that will participate in an operation.",
      "\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency (NSA), told the BBC.",
      "He added that it may have been declassified afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time it was shared.",
      "The messages from Hegseth note what time F-18 fighter aircraft are scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes will take place and in what timeframe \"trigger-based\" attacks could occur.",
      "In this context, \"trigger\" refers to a set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before weapons are deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up.",
      "This information is considered highly sensitive.",
      "Philip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer with the British Army, told the BBC that similar information \"falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret\".",
      "\"You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from,\" he added.",
      "In the wake of the chat's revelations, the White House and other US officials have argued that this information does not constitute a \"war plan\".",
      "In a post on X, Hegseth said: \"The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods.\"",
      "A 'missile guy' hit at girlfriend's home",
      "In this part of the group chat, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz provides an update on the strike - which in military parlance is called a battle damage assessment, or BDA.",
      "Waltz notes that the target building has collapsed, and that the US military had earlier had positive identification of the target - a Houthi \"missile guy\" - walking into the building, which was believed to be his girlfriend's residence.",
      "In his message, Waltz congratulates Pete - referring to Hegseth, as well as the IC, shorthand for \"intelligence community\" and Kurilla, a reference to Michael Kurilla, a US Army General who oversees Central Command, a regional combatant command with responsibility over the Middle East and parts of Central and South Asia.",
      "The messages do not reveal how the target's whereabouts or movements were tracked.",
      "A military expert contacted by the BBC - but who wished to remain nameless - suggested that a combination of aerial platforms, technological tracking capabilities or human intelligence on the ground could have been used, or a combination of various sources.",
      "At least 53 people were killed in the initial wave of US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, which struck more than 30 targets  including training facilities, drone infrastructure, as well as weapons manufacturing and storage sites and command and control centres, including one in which the Pentagon said several unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located.",
      "It is unclear which of the targets Waltz was referring to in the group chat.",
      "CIA activities in Yemen",
      "Another potentially sensitive message comes from Joe Kent, a former special operations soldier and failed congressional candidate who was nominated by Trump to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center.",
      "In his message, Kent refers to Israel carrying out their own strikes.",
      "The Israeli military has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since the beginning of the war in Gaza, in retaliation for Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets conducted in support of Hamas.",
      "The most recent attacks took place on 19 and 26 December of last year.",
      "According to Kent, the Israeli government would seek to \"replenish\" any weapons stocks used in further raids, although he believes that to be a \"minor factor\".",
      "A slightly more sensitive message follows from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who notes that the US is  \"mobilising assets\" to help a strike, but that a delay would \"not negatively impact\" the agency's work in Yemen.",
      "\"Additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership,\" he wrote.",
      "Assets, in this context, could refer to CIA-run spies on the ground in Yemen, or technological means such as surveillance drone flights.",
      "Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and ex-CIA paramilitary officer, said that Ratcliffe's message was very sensitive.",
      "\"Essentially, we don't want to share where the CIA is focused,\" he added.",

      "At 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.",
      "Exhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.",
      "The United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.",
      "Almost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.",
      "\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"",
      "It was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.",
      "There followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.",
      "It is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had.",
      "The United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image.",
      "The baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.",
      "Yet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.",
      "Donald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.",
      "The question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?",
      "A challenge to the Truman legacy",
      "President Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.",
      "\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?",
      "\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"",
      "It's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration.",
      "And the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.",
      "In the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"",
      "Another account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"",
      "Trump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia.",
      "Many saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.",
      "On the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share.",
      "To some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".",
      "The United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for.",
      "Some think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end.",
      "\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"",
      "\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"",
      "Nato Article 5 'is on life support'",
      "The Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.",
      "\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.",
      "For almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all.",
      "In Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.",
      "Others are less sure.",
      "Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support.",
      "\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.",
      "\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"",
      "According to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.",
      "\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.",
      "\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".",
      "And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"",
      "Has a 'fragmentation of the West' begun?",
      "All of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"",
      "In early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".",
      "\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.",
      "\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"",
      "'We forgot the lessons of our history'",
      "One of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed.",
      "Britain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)",
      "\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.",
      "\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"",
      "The prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?",
      "\"It isn't enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"",
      "Then there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.",
      "\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"",
      "But Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.",
      "Others share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.",
      "\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"",
      "Mr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"",
      "Piecing together a new world order",
      "There is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash.",
      "\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.",
      "\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"",
      "The question is how to achieve this.",
      "Ms van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.",
      "\"What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.\"",
      "The European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. \"It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.\"",
      "In the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.",
      "What he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the \"spheres of interest\" system that prevailed for 40 years after the Second World War.",
      "We don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the \"sphere of influence\" of any of the big powers.",

    "summary": "She was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\" after the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
    "story": [
      "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
      "Now, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.",
      "In a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\".",
      "The findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.",
      "Mr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".",
      "\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\".",
      "\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"",
      "Feminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\".",
      "Chakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death.",
      "Perhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".",
      "Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.",
      "Chakraborty, who had been dating Rajput for a year and was living with him, had gone to live with her parents a few days before his death.",
      "\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief.",
      "But within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues.",
      "The Rajput family has not commented on the latest developments regarding his death.",
      "Chakraborty, who consistently denied all the allegations against her, appealed to the government to order a fair probe into the death.",

      "Rhea Chakraborty on 'media trial' after Bollywood star's death",
      "Why is Indian TV obsessed with Sushant Singh Rajput's death?",
      "However, the tragedy - which came in the midst of a lockdown while India was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic - became the biggest prime-time story for a nation glued to their television sets.",
      "And Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.",
      "Some of India's most high-profile television hosts dedicated their entire shows to discussing the case, describing her as a \"manipulative\" woman who \"performed black magic\" and \"drove Sushant to suicide\".",
      "A video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt.",
      "The vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.",
      "She was released a month later and has since tried her hand at motivational speaking and has now reinvented herself as a businesswoman who has launched a clothing line and her own podcast with celebrity interviews. She is also doing a reality TV show.",
      "Chakraborty has also spoken about her ordeal, including how the name-calling and character assassination cost her work and how her family were also hounded.",
      "\"I tried contacting people in the [Hindi film] industry, asking for roles, any roles. But then I realised that people won't cast you because of all that had happened,\" she told Humans of Bombay last year.",
      "\"I was very angry for a long time. But it gave me acidity and I suffered from gut issues. So, it became important for me to forgive,\" she said, adding \" I have not forgiven everyone. Some people are on my hit list.",
      "It is not clear what action she is contemplating against those who vilified her, but many are now suggesting on social media that she sue them for damages.",
      "While neither the actress or her lawyer have not yet said what they intend to do, columnist Namita Bhandare points out that seeking compensation in India, with its overburdened judiciary and millions of pending court cases, is anything but easy.",
      "\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"",
      "According to Ms Bhandare, Chakraborty \"became expendable in the pursuit of a juicy story\" since she \"was not a big name and had no powerful people backing her in the film industry\".",
      "What happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\".",
      "Some of the videos of prominent news anchors making slanderous comments against Chakraborty have now resurfaced, and are being shared extensively on social media. Many people, including some of the actress's Bollywood colleagues, are demanding that the presenters apologise to her.",

    "story": [
      "At a secret location away from prying eyes, Ukrainian engineers test a long-range drone called Raybird.",
      "The machine, which looks like a mini plane with wings, is placed on a launchpad, stretched like an arrow on a crossbow and then shot into the air.",
      "Raybird can fly non-stop for more than 20 hours and cover a distance of more than 1,000km (620 miles). It carries out reconnaissance missions, and is also used to destroy targets both on the front line and deep inside Russia.",
      "Among their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.",
      "But after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.",
      "As well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would implement these agreements immediately.",
      "Russia says sanctions must be lifted before Ukraine maritime ceasefire can start",
      "However, Oleksiy from Skyeton, the company that develops the Raybird, doubts that Moscow would adhere to the ceasefire.",
      "\"[Russians punch you in the face, then the next day they make an agreement but ask to tie up your hands. So the possibility that they will continue fighting remains,\" explains Oleksiy.",
      "Yet, this deal will also bring relief to Russia.",
      "It's estimated that this year alone, Ukraine carried out more than 30 attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure using drones and other weapons.",
      "They've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.",
      "Russia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.",
      "And Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.",
      "Ukraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.",
      "Kyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.",
      "Zelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.",
      "The energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.",
      "Last month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.",
      "And lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.",
      "Moscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.",
      "At the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.",
      "And if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.",
      "Back at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field.",
      "Oleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.",

    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

      "Goldberg initially thought this was a hoax, but soon realised it was real.",
      "The whole issue is adding pressure on the national security adviser, with Democrats in the House and Senate calling for an urgent inquiry.",

      "These White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.",
      "That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.",

The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.",

    "story": [
      "Beneath the acrid smell of tear gas on the night air in Istanbul, there is a hint of something else - a whiff of panic on the part of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "One of his rivals has been put behind bars - so far, so familiar.",
      "But the jailing of Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, suggests President Erdogan is rattled \u2013 and he may have gone too far. The mayor's opposition Republican People's party (CHP), which is summoning vast crowds onto the streets, is certainly hoping so.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - always smartly turned out, even as he prepared to be detained - is the main rival to Turkey's increasingly authoritarian leader. He could well replace him in presidential elections due to be held by 2028 - assuming he is free to contest them.",
      "But this is far more than a row about the fate of Istanbul's mayor - charismatic though he may be.",
      "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era. Many see this as a chance to call halt and stop the descent into all-out autocracy - if it's not already too late.",

      "Why are thousands of people protesting in Turkey?",
      "More than 1,000 people have been detained so far - in just 5 days - and counting. That's an indication of how easy it is to be arrested here.",
      "Turkey claims to be a functioning democracy - and at face value, it is. There are elections. Voter turnout is usually high - Turks cherish their right to go to the polls and cast their ballots. Voting is largely fair, on the day itself.",
      "The problem is what happens away from the polling stations.",
      "Opposition politicians can be jailed. Critics intimidated. Protesters arrested. The media is largely government controlled. A tweet ridiculing the president could land you in a cell. By the time polling day comes around there's a tsunami of pro-government coverage and the opposition struggles to get a look in.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu is the type of politician who can cut through all this and reach the voters. He's media savvy and has been elected mayor of Istanbul three times. Now he's accused of embezzlement, taking bribes and running a criminal organisation.",
      "If convicted he could be barred from standing in the presidential race. He's already appealing a previous conviction and sentence of two years in prison, for insulting election officials.",
      "Turkey insists that its courts are independent and simply follow the law. Human rights activists here, and independent analysts, scoff at that idea.",
      "The campaign group, Human Rights Watch, said the detention of the mayor, along with about 100 other municipal officials and politicians, is a \"politically motivated move to stifle lawful political activities\". In the past it has criticised \"politicised decisions by courts\" in Turkey.",
      "In a post on X, where he has 9.6m followers, Imamoglu said the case against him was \"a black stain on our democracy\", adding: \"I stand tall. I will never bow.\"",
      "That's what Erdogan, 71, may be afraid of - an opponent who is younger, at 53, also appeals to conservative Turkish voters, and is ready for a long fight.",
      "So, what happens now?",
      "The protests could gain momentum and keep spreading. That will present a serious challenge to Erdogan. How long before his heavily armed security forces crack down even harder? How long before someone loses their life at a protest? There is a breaking point for every strongman regime, and it can come with a single bullet.",
      "The opposition intends to keep up the pressure, and the demonstrations.",
      "But after his two decades at the top, Erdogan still has plenty of loyal supporters. He controls virtually all the levers of power and seems determined to hang on. He will be banking on the demonstrations petering out, over time.",
      "The president and his ruling AK party will be hoping the protesters will grow weary and go back to worrying about crushing inflation (39% in February), and the dwindling value of the Turkish lira, rather than free speech, and democracy.",

    "summary": "Alice Guo's star was on the rise in the Philippines - until alleged links to a scam operation led to her downfall.",
    "story": [
      "In early 2022, residents of the rural Philippine town of Bamban, north of Manila, gathered for the mayoral campaign rally of a plucky young woman named Alice Leal Guo.",
      "Supporters dressed in pink \u2013 their candidate's favourite colour \u2013 chattered in anticipation of her arrival.",
      "Then came the low thudding of a helicopter rotor, prompting cheers from the crowd. Sitting in the cockpit, Guo \u2013 in a pink shirt and a pilot's headset \u2013 flashed a smile, waving down at her supporters.",
      "As the helicopter touched down, the crowd broke into a chant: \"A-lice Guo! A-lice Guo!\"",
      "At 31, Guo's star was rising: with promises of generous subsidies and economic development, all delivered in her signature brassy, upbeat tone, she had galvanised a following in the town which would see her become its first female mayor.",
      "But few of those cheering could have predicted that less than three years later, Guo would be behind bars, facing charges of human trafficking and allegations that she was a Chinese spy.",
      "Her downfall began with a police raid that uncovered a compound where a giant scam operation was being run from just behind her office. But as the authorities delved deeper, and Guo struggled to answer basic queries about her past, a perplexing question emerged: who really is Alice Guo?",
      "The mayor everyone seemed to love",
      "Guo says she came to local politics from the pig-farming business, having managed her family's commercial piggery for several years.",
      "The career change would have required deep pockets \u2013 and when quizzed about her campaign finances much later, Guo said it was friends and acquaintances in the pig-farming business who had supported her mayoral bid.",
      "But Guo also had connections to a number of wealthy Chinese businesspeople. Little is known about them, but some have subsequently been convicted of money-laundering, and now also face charges of human trafficking alongside Guo.",
      "Her campaign focused on her sunny persona. On stage at one event, Guo told her audience: \"For our team, rule number one is: Do no harm! No harm is allowed, we should just spread love, love, love!\"",
      "Such cheerful platitudes would carry a taint of irony, in retrospect, when authorities exposed the harm and suffering they alleged had been inflicted under Guo's watch.",
      "But upon taking office in June 2022, she brought the youthful, bright-eyed energy of her campaign into Bamban Municipal Hall, painting it pink and decorating the outside of the building with flowers.",
      "\"Alice was beautiful, she was kind and she was helpful to other women,\" said Priscilla May Aban, 31, who runs a vegetable stall in the town. She told the BBC that she had voted for Guo precisely because she was a woman, adding that as mayor, Guo had arranged cleaning jobs for women of the town.",
      "Guo was widely regarded as a caring and empathetic leader, judging by conversations the BBC had with several residents of Bamban. Miah Mejia, the daughter of one of Alice's political allies, claimed that she had given a free scholarship to every local household. Another interviewee told us he hadn't received a college scholarship but had been given a cash subsidy for his school fees.",
      "An emotional Francisco Flores, 75, said, \"She's helped a lot of poor people here in Bamban, giving medicines and the way she is with people, you'd never see a problem.\"",
      "He proudly mentioned the arrival of a McDonald's and a branch of the Philippine fast-food chain Jollibee during Guo's tenure.",
      "Online, pro-Guo social media accounts portrayed her as a progressive young mayor presiding over a pink-tinted wonderland of parades, buffalo races and concerts.",
      "A year-and-half into her mayoralty, however, this carefully crafted image began to crumble.",
      "Inside Bamban's underbelly",
      "In February 2024, Philippine police received a report about a Vietnamese national who had escaped from the captivity of Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated, a company operating out of a walled compound in Bamban.",
      "On the evening of 12 March, police officers and soldiers gathered nearby to plan a raid on the site, located just a minute's walk from Guo's office in the Municipal Hall.",
      "One officer who was there, Marvin de la Paz of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), told the BBC that around midnight, police informants sent word that people were leaving the compound in buses.",
      "Suspecting that their plans for a raid had been leaked, Mr de la Paz and his colleagues raced straight for the compound. On the way, they saw people fleeing in the other direction, and some officers in the convoy had to peel off and chase them down. When they arrived at the site, they found one of the largest scam hubs ever uncovered in the Philippines, containing 36 buildings and spanning almost 20 acres.",
      "\"We were amazed,\" Mr de la Paz said, \"That was our first time seeing such a grandiose entrance [to a scam compound]... Somehow you feel like you're small in this compound.\"",
      "It later emerged that the compound was built on land which Guo had previously owned \u2013 and that, as mayor, she had granted Zun Yuan a business permit. Her name also appeared on an electricity bill found at the site.",
      "Alice Guo's lawyers did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "Zun Yuan was purportedly an online gambling and entertainment company, which held a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (Pogo) licence \u2013 accreditation that previously allowed such entities to operate legally in the Philippines.",
      "A relaxation in gambling regulations under ex-President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017 led to a surge of Pogo-driven business activity. But many scam syndicates also found Pogo licences useful for masking their criminal operations \u2013 and PAOCC told the BBC they found evidence that Zun Yuan was running \"pig-butchering\" scams from its office in the compound.",
      "Pig-butchering is a con where scammers take time to build trust with victims by posing as lovers or prospective business partners, then trick them into investing their money into fraudulent schemes.",
      "When shown around the compound by PAOCC officers earlier this month, the BBC found, in a deserted employee dormitory, training scripts on how to scam targets.",
      "\"I want to create my own financial empire,\" a scripted character \u2013 a female crypto expert at an international bank - says to her target, before flattering him and encouraging him to share his dreams. She is told to put her target on hold while pretending to \"cash in on a trade\" - only to declare, moments later, that she had made a killing. She then asks whether he himself knows how to trade, setting him up for the transfer of money that would soon follow.",
      "This is just one of the many ways in which these compounds swindle billions  of dollars around the world. Typically run by Chinese organised crime groups across South East Asia, they are staffed by a mixture of willing employees and trafficked victims who are forced to scam.",
      "According to de la Paz, he and his colleagues found more than 300 foreign nationals in the Bamban compound, many of them working there against their will.",
      "Punishments for disobedient or underperforming workers ranged from beatings to the banal: the BBC was shown a notebook from the compound, in which a worker had copied out  the phrase, \"I will meet my targets tomorrow\", hundreds of times in Chinese.",
      "Enclosed by walls topped with barbed wire, the workers' area of the compound was its own self-contained world, featuring a basketball court, supermarket and restaurants. Employees lived in rooms of six, each with a balcony equipped with a toilet and shower.",
      "Their bosses meanwhile lived in a separate gated enclave, says de la Paz, who showed the BBC one of the villas there.",
      "A marble-clad living room featured a high-end entertainment system, security monitor and ornate hardwood furniture. Behind the house was a swimming pool, beside which was a staircase that led down into what were supposedly escape tunnels, now flooded with water.",
      "By the time security forces stormed the Bamban compound on the evening of 12 March 2024, some of these scam bosses had already eluded capture.",
      "But the raid signalled a shift in the political climate.",
      "In June 2022, just as Guo was being sworn in as mayor, Rodrigo Duterte's presidential term had ended.",
      "His successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, soon began facing calls for a ban on Pogo businesses. Many across Philippine society sounded the alarm about the criminality that often lurked within, despite the millions they brought in as revenue. Their biggest customers were rich Chinese, which led to concerns about foreign influence as Marcos, unlike his predecessor, courted Washington over Beijing.",
      "When the raid in Bamban happened, it exposed a dark underbelly of the Philippines \u2013 and the two worlds of Alice Guo   \u2013 the pink office from where she had sought a political career and the scam compound, which suggested far murkier ambitions      \u2013 collapsed in on one another.",
      "'Amnesia girl'",
      "Guo had been a relatively unknown name in the Philippines until last May when she was called to appear before the Senate to explain her links to the scam compound.",
      "Almost overnight, she became a meme. When she told senators she had grown up on a family farm, it brought swift ridicule from Filipinos who said she was too glamorous for the countryside. She became notorious for her inconsistent, vague comments, as well as her claims to have forgotten basic details of her early life, leading social media to nickname her \"my amnesia girl\".",
      "Guo said she'd had a secluded childhood as the child of a Chinese father and Filipino mother \u2013 but could not remember where in the Philippines her family home had been.",
      "At one point, a senator said to her: \"Please mayor, a little more candour than you have shown so far in answering some of the important questions.\"",
      "She told sceptical senators that she had sold her stake in the land before becoming mayor, and that the issuance of a business permit to Zun Yuan had been a mere administrative measure.",
      "Suspicion mounted when, during the hearings, a court in Singapore convicted two of Guo's Chinese former business partners in the Philippines of money-laundering.",
      "Then, last July, despite the intense public interest in her case, Guo managed to slip through the travel restrictions imposed on her and escape to Indonesia. A few months later, she was re-arrested and returned to the Philippines.",
      "It was also in July that Philippine investigators made a breakthrough. Guo's fingerprints were found to match those on file for a girl from China named Guo Hua Ping, who had arrived in the Philippines alongside her mother, also Chinese, in the early 2000s.",
      "This revelation sparked another line of inquiry in the Senate: the idea that Guo might be a spy, exercising influence or gathering intelligence for the Chinese state. The idea spread quickly among the watching public, dominating public discussion of the case.",
      "Jaye Bekema - a senior officer on the staff of Risa Hontiveros, one of the senators who probed potential links between scam syndicates and Chinese intelligence - says the possibility that Guo was a spy warranted an investigation.",
      "\"I think there should be some clarity as to what a spy means,\" Ms Bekema said, while stressing that there is no conclusive proof of Guo being a spy.",
      "\"I am more likely to believe that she didn't plan to be a spy, but that she was tapped to be one [by the Chinese government] because of her criminal connections and her influence on local politics and the local government.\"",
      "In many ways, Guo had become a victim of her own success. The career she chose and the limelight she worked hard to attract meant that she was fully exposed to public scrutiny when China-Philippines relations soured under Marcos.",
      "As political rhetoric escalated and tensions between the two countries spiralled, not least of all in the South China Sea, the young mayor found herself in the crosshairs of espionage accusations.",
      "Others, however, are more sceptical of the allegation. The Chinese state and Guo would have made strange bedfellows, according to Teresita Ang See, a civic leader in the Chinese-Filipino community.",
      "\"What can she spy on in a place like [Bamban]? It's in central Luzon, it's not near any of the sensitive establishments. Why use her? She's very visible, she flaunts her lifestyle. The last person you would use as a spy would be a person like Alice Guo,\" says Ang See.",
      "The Pogo problem",
      "But those who led the questioning against Guo, such as Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, say that it's more complicated than that.",
      "\"Transnational criminals working around the region know how to tap into... I'll call it local talent to penetrate our society, whether through politics or business,\" he explains.",
      "Either way, Guo's case shed light on the Philippine state's vulnerability to being corrupted and co-opted by criminal groups abusing Pogo licences.",
      "In mid-2024, President Marcos declared a blanket ban on all Pogos, citing their widespread abuse by organised crime.",
      "Gatchalian says that the investigation into Alice Guo helped drive this change.",
      "\"Because of it, there was a groundswell of people really clamouring for a ban,\" he tells the BBC. \"And that's when the president officially banned Pogos.\"",
      "Since then, Philippine police have raided scores of scam hubs across the country. But given how influential the syndicates have become, there are concerns that leaks within the security forces and government institutions are allowing criminals to evade capture, according to Mr de la Paz.",
      "Ms Bekema says she feels certain that some candidates in the upcoming national elections are still being financed with Pogo money, while Ang See says that serving police officers have been found working for the criminal syndicates.",
      "In Bamban, concerns about state infiltration seem far from people's minds.",
      "The streets are decked with brightly-coloured campaign posters for the upcoming municipal elections. The Municipal Hall has been whitewashed, and the flowers have been removed.",
      "Guo is currently on trial in six separate cases, potentially facing decades in prison, and has been barred from running for public office again. She has pleaded not guilty to human trafficking charges.",
      "Yet many still treasure the memory of their embattled ex-mayor.",
      "One of those currently standing for Bamban councillor is Miah Mejia's father, Fortunato, a garrulous 69-year-old, who also ran in 2022 as a member of Alice's party, although he lost. He even featured in one of her publicity videos at the time.",
      "He says that the people of Bamban had taken a chance by electing Guo, but that she had good connections to Chinese investors and had delivered on all her promises to the townspeople.",
      "He is also indifferent to the Senate's evidence that Guo was not a Filipino.",
      "\"That's what they've been showing, but we still don't believe it because we don't care whether she's Filipino or not,\" he says. \"What's important is whether or not she helps us.\"",
      "Mr Mejia is adamant that the Alice Guo he knew would not have been involved in human trafficking.",
      "\"Never, ever would she do something like that,\" he says, flatly. \"I know she has a heart. She fears the Lord.\"",

      "The new school year began on Saturday in Afghanistan but for the fourth consecutive year, girls over 12 were barred from attending classes.",
      "\"All my dreams were shattered,\" she says, her voice fragile and filled with emotion.",
      "Amina, now 15, has always wanted to become a doctor. As a little girl, she suffered from a heart defect and underwent surgery. The surgeon who saved her life was a woman \u2013 an image that stayed with her and inspired her to take her studies seriously.",
      "But in 2021, when the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan, Amina's dream was abruptly put on hold.",
      "\"When my dad told me the schools were closed, I was really sad. It was a very bad feeling,\" she says quietly. \"I wanted to get an education so that I could become a doctor.\"",
      "The restrictions on education for teenage girls, imposed by the Taliban, has affected more than one million girls, according to Unicef, the UN's children's agency.",
      "Now, madrassas \u2013 religious centres focused on Islamic teachings \u2013 have become the only way for many women and teenage girls to access education. However, those whose families can afford private tuition may still have access to subjects including maths, science and languages.",
      "While the madrassas are seen by some as a way to offer young women access to some of the education they would have had in mainstream schools, others say they are no substitute and there are concerns of brainwashing.",
      "I meet Amina in the dimly-lit basement of Al-Hadith madrassa in Kabul, a newly established private religious educational centre for around 280 female students of various ages.",
      "The basement is cold, with cardboard walls and a sharp chill in the air. After chatting for about 10 minutes, our toes are already going numb.",
      "Al-Hadith madrassa was founded a year ago by Amina's brother, Hamid, who felt compelled to act after seeing the toll that the education ban had taken on her.",
      "\"When girls were denied education, my sister's dream of becoming a heart surgeon was crushed, significantly affecting her wellbeing\", says Hamid, who is in his early thirties.",
      "\"Having the chance to go back to school, as well as learning midwifery and first aid, made her feel much better about her future,\" he adds.",
      "Afghanistan remains the only country where women and girls are banned from secondary and higher education.",
      "The Taliban government originally suggested the prohibition would be temporary, pending the fulfilment of certain conditions, such as an \"Islamic\" curriculum. However, there has been no progress towards reopening schools for older girls in the years since.",
      "In January 2025, a report by the Afghanistan Centre for Human Rights suggested that madrassas are being used to further the Taliban's ideological goals.",
      "The report alleges that \"extremist content\" has been integrated into their curriculum.",
      "It says that textbooks advocated by the Taliban promote its political and military activities, and prohibited the mixing of men and women, as well as endorsing the enforced wearing of the hijab.",
      "The Afghan Centre for Human Rights calls the ban on older girls attending school a \"systematic and targeted violation\" of their right to quality education.",
      "Before the Taliban return, the number of registered madrassas is believed to have been around 5,000. They focus on religious education, which includes Quranic, Hadith, Sharia law, and Arabic language studies.",
      "But since the restrictions on girls' education were introduced some have expanded the teaching of subjects including chemistry, physics, mathematics, and geography, and languages like Dari, Pashto, and English.",
      "Though a few madrassas tried to introduce midwifery and first aid training, the Taliban banned medical training for women in December last year.",
      "Hamid said he was dedicated to providing an education which blends both religious and other academic subjects for secondary school-age girls.",
      "\"Socialising with others girls again made my sister much happier,\" he told me with a smile, clearly proud of his sister's resilience.",
      "We visit another independently-run madrassa in Kabul.",
      "The Shaikh Abdul Qadr Jilani madrassa educates more than 1,800 girls and women from the ages of five to 45. Classes are organised by student ability rather than age. We were able to visit under strict supervision.",
      "Like Al-Hadath madrassa, it is freezing cold. The three-storey building has no heating, and some classrooms were missing doors and windows.",
      "In one large room, two Quran classes and a sewing class are taking place simultaneously, as a group of girls wearing hijabs and black face masks sit cross-legged on the carpet.",
      "The only heat source in the school is a small electric radiator in the second-floor office of the director, Mohammad Ibrahim Barakzai.",
      "Mr Barakzai tells me that academic subjects are taught alongside religious ones.",
      "But when I ask for evidence of that, staff search for a while before bringing out a few tattered maths and science textbooks.",
      "Meanwhile, the classrooms are well stocked with religious texts.",
      "This madrassa is divided into two sections: formal and informal.",
      "The formal section covers subjects like languages, history, science, and Islamic studies. The informal section covers Quranic studies, Hadith, Islamic law, and practical skills like tailoring.",
      "Notably, graduates from the informal section outnumber those from the formal section by 10 to one.",
      "Hadiya, who is 20 years old, recently graduated from the madrassa after studying a broad range of subjects including maths, physics, chemistry, and geography.",
      "She speaks passionately about chemistry and physics. \"I love science. It's all about matter and how these concepts relate to the world around me,\" she says.",
      "Hadiya now teaches the Quran at the madrassa, as she tells me there was not enough demand for her favourite subjects.",
      "Safia, also 20, teaches the Pashto language at Al-Hadith madrassa. She passionately believes that girls in religious centres should enhance what she described as their personal development.",
      "She focuses on Fiqh, the Islamic legal framework essential for daily Muslim practices.",
      "\"Fiqh is not included in mainstream schools or universities. As a Muslim woman, studying Fiqh is vital for women's betterment,\" she says.",
      "\"Understanding concepts such as ghusl \u2013 ablution \u2013 the distinctions in prostration between genders, and the prerequisites for prayer are crucial.\"",
      "However, she adds that madrassas \"cannot serve as a substitute for mainstream schools and universities\".",
      "\"Educational institutions, including mainstream schools and universities, are absolutely essential for our society. The closure of these establishments would lead to a gradual decline in knowledge within Afghanistan,\" she warns.",
      "Tawqa, 13, is a quiet, reserved student who also studies at the Shaikh Abdul Qadr Jilani madrassa. From a devout family, she attends classes with her older sister.",
      "\"Religious subjects are my favourite,\" she says. \"I like learning about what kind of hijab a woman should wear, how she should treat her family, how to treat her brother and husband well and never be rude to them.\"",
      "\"I want to become a religious missionary and share my faith with people around the world.\"",
      "The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, has raised serious concerns about the Taliban's restrictive \"madrassa-style\" education system.",
      "He has emphasised the need to restore educational opportunities for girls beyond sixth grade and for women in higher education.",
      "Mr Bennett warned that this limited education, combined with high unemployment and poverty, \"could foster radical ideologies and increase the risk of homegrown terrorism, threatening regional and global stability\".",
      "The Taliban Ministry of Education claims that around three million students in Afghanistan are enrolled in these religious educational centres.",
      "It has promised to reopen girls' schools under certain conditions, but this has yet to materialise.",

      "\"Colorado is thrilled to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to its new home in Boulder starting in 2027,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. \"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.\"",
      "\"This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival's future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,\" Sundance Institute Board Chair  Ebs Burnough said.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

    "summary": "The stars of a new Broadway production of Shakespeare's tragic tale about friendship and betrayal explain why they say they've worked their whole careers for this moment.",
    "story": [
      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",
      "Gyllenhaal added, \"I feel tremendous gratitude. And he makes me feel it when I walk in that rehearsal room every day.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

      "Washington \u2014 On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O'Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O'Brien.",
      "\"I think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\" comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \"It's in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\"",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salvador-dali-museum-of-surrealist-art/",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:40:28 -0400",
    "summary": "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law this week that bans some artificial dyes as well as two preservatives from foods sold statewide.",
    "story": [
      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 23:25:24 -0400",
    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced\u00a025% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S. The new duties could lead to sticker shock on a wide range of automobiles for American consumers, including those manufactured in the United States, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\"\u00a0 Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries, goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",

      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",

      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Shares of automakers slid ahead of the announcement, with General Motors sinking 3.2% and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, dropping 3.5%. The Detroit automakers' manufacturing plants and supply chains are spread across North America, so additional tariffs would raise their costs and crimp profits.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% and are down 33% this year.",
      "Consumers are also likely to feel the sting of additional import duties. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated.",
      "Beyond the impact on the auto sector, investors have been rattled by President Trump's protectionist trade policies. The U.S. is scheduled to announce a raft of tariffs on April 2, including 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with even more sweeping matching levies on a number of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors.",
      "He added, \"Even those who might agree with the long-term benefits of tariffs have to acknowledge there will be a multi-quarter period of substantial disruption to the economy, with softer growth and higher inflation.\"",

      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations.

Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",

Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner.

At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "When Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Will he fully understand the struggles of many Social Security recipients or connect with their challenges? That remains to be seen,\" TSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton said. \"The key issue is finding the right balance between introducing new ideas and protecting Social Security as an essential public program.\"",
      "After Bisignano was nominated in December, the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy organization founded by the AFL-CIO, also raised questions about his lack of experience dealing with social services for seniors and disabled people.",
      "\"Nothing in Mr. Bisignano's career suggests that he understands the unique needs of older and disabled Americans. His record in the private sector doesn't instill confidence that he will protect beneficiaries from plans to dismantle and replace the SSA workforce with AI chatbots,\" Richard Fiesta, executive director at the Alliance, said in a statement at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly anxious about their financial prospects, with a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low amid growing concerns about tariffs and inflation.",
      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",
      "Adams predicts a weakening in discretionary consumer spending in the near-term, but sees a potential break in the clouds further ahead if, perhaps in 2026, tariff talk is replaced by tax cuts.",
      "\"If the public conversation turns from spending cuts to tax cut happy talk, consumer sentiment could rebound. But in the meantime, the economy is likely to slow and underperform its growth in 2023 and 2024,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",

      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",

      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",

      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",

      "\"The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,\" Renfroe said.",
      "Earlier this month, DeJoy said he planned to cut 10,000 workers and billions of dollars from the USPS budget and he'd do that working with DOGE, according to a letter sent to members of Congress.",
      "USPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.",
      "Critics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.",

The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",

      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",

      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",

      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",

    "summary": "The EPA announced that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act by emailing President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "In its latest move to dismantle environmental regulation under the Trump Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act and other rules designed to limit air pollution with a simple offer: email us for a presidential exemption.",
      "Businesses that would like to avoid complying with certain EPA rules can email the agency with a reason justifying why it should be allowed an exemption and how it is in the best interest of the national security of the United States. According to the EPA website, all emails do not entitle the submitter to an exemption, but the president \"will make a decision\" based on the merits of the request.",
      "The EPA said in a statement to CBS News that section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act \"specifically states that the President may exempt any stationary source 'if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.'\"",
      "But many in the environmental sector were stunned by the proposal.",
      "\"This section of the Clean Air Act is designed to protect people from exposure to the most toxic chemicals -- the ones that are dangerous in the smallest concentrations,\" environmental law expert Michael Gerrard said in an email. \"It's shocking that EPA is now providing industries with a simple form they can use to get out of these rules and keep on emitting these harmful substances.\"",
      "For years, heavy industry has abided by rules and regulations set by the EPA to comply with the Clean Air Act, which has often led companies to invest heavily in expensive technology to reduce toxic air emissions, an expense critics have often derided as onerous.",
      "So, on March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the \"greatest day of deregulation\" and said the agency was reviewing 31 rules that, he claims, amount to \"trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and hidden taxes.\" The mission of the rollback is to reduce costly regulations that burden the industry. By reviewing the rules, Zeldin said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that \"As we unleash American energy, revitalize domestic manufacturing, cut costs for families, and restore the rule of law, we do so with the firm belief that America's greatest days lie ahead.\"",
      "The rollbacks were cheered by Republican leaders and industry alike, \"The action taken by the Trump EPA today is exactly what needs to be done to secure American energy dominance and restore the communities who have been negatively impacted by regulations and overreach from the Biden administration,\" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said in a statement. Capito is also the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the EPA.",
      "It could take years for the agency to finalize new rules to reduce the costs of environmental compliance, let alone the legal challenges it will face. In an attempt to fast-track this process, the EPA is offering this unique \"hall pass,\" as some describe the presidential exemption, to enable companies to stop complying now, rather than years later when the updated rules are complete.",
      "\"Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA is now the Environmental Polluter Agency. His invitation for companies to put arsenic and mercury into the air if they claim it enhances 'national security' is a vast abuse of the President's given authority,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said in a statement to CBS News. Merkley also sits on the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and its first priority is to review legislation on air pollution.",
      "Merkley's fellow committee member, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), had similar concerns, \"Trump and his puppets at EPA are giving the most toxic polluters carte blanche to poison our air,\" he said in an email to CBS News. \" As corrupt as this is, no one can have any confidence that either the technology or national security standards will be met.\"",
      "Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement, \"The idea that some obscure, rarely-used provision of the Clean Air Act empowers EPA to grant sweeping exemptions to polluting companies because they send an email is preposterous. It's clearly illegal - no doubt there.\"",
      "Environmental law experts believe the policy will be challenged in court. \"I've never seen anything like this before,\" said Mary Nichols, a distinguished counsel for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA Law School. Nichols says because the statute is so broad, it is subject to abuse. \"I think the likely first lawsuit is a blanket challenge to the entire procedure,\" she said.",
      "CBS News asked the EPA if it could explain how all the emails will be processed and assessed, whether each one will be individually considered by President Trump, and how many emails the agency has already received, but the EPA did not address those questions.",
      "But sending the email request to the EPA does create a paper trail that companies may want to consider. \"This is something that we will fight to make public,\" said Joe Bonfiglio, executive director of the U.S. region of the Environmental Defense Fund, a prominent environmental nonprofit. \"For companies who take advantage of this hall pass, there are organizations like ours who will make sure communities around those facilities know about the requests.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration and 2,400 from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to shrink the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services by nearly a quarter, officials\u00a0announced Thursday, as part of a major restructuring of the department.",
      "Managers in several health agencies are now racing to figure out details on how the reorganization will impact their work.",
      "Trump officials in multiple parts of the department have said they are aiming to implement much of the changes quickly, often within 10 days.",
      "The changes amount to a workforce that will be around 33% smaller than it was at the end of the Biden administration. There were around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records, up from 81,917 at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "Some 10,000 full-time employees will be cut through the layoffs, in addition to other vacant positions that will not be replaced. Thousands of full-time staff have already left the department in recent months, in addition to thousands more contractor and fellowship positions that were also eliminated.",
      "\"When combined with HHS' other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees,\" the department said in a release, estimating that taxpayers would save $1.8 billion from the changes.",
      "A fact sheet shared with reporters and health officials says that \"no additional cuts are currently planned\" beyond those announced Thursday and in recent weeks.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration, according to the fact sheet. The administration is also cutting 1,200 jobs from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\"This reduction will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers, nor will it impact inspectors,\" the fact sheet says of the FDA changes.",
      "At the CDC, the department says the workforce will decline by around 2,400 employees, to \"focus on returning to its core mission of preparing for and respond to epidemics and outbreaks.\" One U.S. official said the cuts are not intended to undermine infectious disease work at the agency.",
      "From the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the workforce will decline by \"approximately 300 employees, with a focus on reducing minor duplication\" at CMS, which had already been facing hiring limits due to a budget crunch in recent years. The reorganization will not impact Medicare or Medicaid services, it says.",
      "The department's reduction-in-force \"is primarily aimed at administrative positions,\" according to a letter sent Thursday to unions in mutliple HHS agencies, but \"will also target roles in high-cost regions\" and who are \"determined to be redundant or duplicative\" with others.",
      "\"Specific notices to employees may be sent as early as Friday, March 28,\" according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy said in video\u00a0annoncement shared Thursday by the department.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported details of the reorganization.",
      "Health officials had been bracing for steep cuts to be announced this week, as part of the sweeping restructuring architected with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force.",
      "Several health agency officials said they had seen stepped up security measures coming into work this morning. Managers have largely been in the dark about the changes, officials have said, aside from a handful of changes already announced within the department.",
      "One major change announced earlier this month would result in significantly cutting the number of general counsel offices, shrinking the ranks of the department's attorneys. One health official said the closures would amount to eliminating two-thirds of the HHS regional attorneys.",
      "Kennedy said earlier this week at the White House that the DOGE team headed by billionaire Elon Musk had \"identified extraordinary waste in my department and HHS.\" He cited what they considered duplicated work for communications, procurement, IT and HR departments across 40 operating divisions in HHS.",
      "\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies,\" Kennedy said Monday.",
      "One of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"",
      "\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale. We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of department sand agencies while preserving their core functions,\" Kennedy said in the Thursday video.",
      "The new administration will consolidate work from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxc Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthy \"into a new, unified entity,\" the department said.",
      "This new AHA agency also effectively combines many of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" priorities under one roof, ranging from this year's update to federal dietary guidelines to public health statements about the use of fluoride. The work will be supported by the U.S. surgeon general, the fact sheet says.",
      "Officials within the Health Resources and Services Administration are expecting deep cuts from the merger, including to the agency's human resources and Provider Relief Bureau staff, two officials said.",
      "HRSA's Provider Relief Bureau had been charged with oversight of aid dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic in the health care industry. More than $1 billion in debts to the federal government could go unrecouped if the team's work is left unfinished, one official said.",
      "\"Our budget was already covered with the original funding and would have been recouped five times over, had we been allowed to do our job,\" the official said.",
      "The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which was elevated into a separate agency under the Biden administration to oversee tasks like the pandemic stockpile, will be absorbed into the CDC.",
      "The two agencies are now scrambling to draw up plans by Saturday on how to merge the two, one health official said.",
      "Work from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which had been bracing for as much as 90% of their staff to be cut by DOGE, will be merged with another agency to create the Office of Strategy.",
      "And the functions from the Administration for Community Living targeted at older adults and people with disabilities will be moved to other agencies, the department said, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy acknowledged in his remarks.",
      "Details of who exactly will be cut from the department within the agencies remain unclear, under the new reorganization plans. As of Thursday morning, multiple federal health officials said they had received little guidance from the department, aside from Kennedy's announcement.",
      "In his remarks in the video, Kennedy said that they were \"focused on paring away excess administrators while increasing the number of scientists and frontline health providers\" in the changes.",
      "\"We're going to streamline our agency and eliminate redundancies and invite everyone to align behind a simple, bold mission: I want every HHS employee to wake up every morning asking themselves, 'what can I do to restore American health today,'\" he added.",

Ratings of today's economy are unchanged overall and continue to be negative, much as they have been for years going back to the pandemic.",
      "Prices continue to weigh on finances: most say they're still rising, and they continue to be the main driver in how Americans are evaluating the economy.",

      "And despite stock market volatility, those who say the market matters to their personal finances aren't very different in their outlook for the economy than Americans overall.",
      "This comes as just over half say they're doing at least fairly well personally at the moment, as has also generally been the case over the last year, but within this group are dramatic differences by income. Those at higher levels are far more likely to say they're doing okay.",
      "Most Americans say their incomes still aren't keeping pace with inflation.",
      "They express these sentiments as a key consumer confidence index recently hit a multi-year low.",
      "Ratings for their own financial situation returned to just over half saying their situation is good; those with incomes above $50,000 are more likely to say so. Meanwhile, most of those with family incomes under $50,000 continue to say they're doing badly.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 National security adviser Mike Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have so far survived the disclosure that they ran a high-level meeting on a military operation via a non-government app and inadvertently included a journalist.",
      "But President Trump continues to privately vent his irritation about it and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout is quieting down, according to sources familiar with the matter. The issue is \"still a hot potato,\" one official told CBS News.",
      "Sources said Mr. Trump has been more irritated that Waltz had the phone number for the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, than he was about the use of the Signal app by top national security officials to discuss coming plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. The magazine published its account on Monday.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, multiple sources said. But in the end, Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump has not asked him to step down, several sources said. Publicly, Mr. Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "The Signal situation, which Waltz called \"a mistake,\" hasn't been the only snafu for the president's team this week. Mr. Trump on Wednesday evening was unaware that four U.S. military members had gone missing the day before in Lithuania until a reporter asked him about it during an on-camera event in the Oval Office.",
      "The Army soldiers went missing early Tuesday during a military exercise. The Pentagon had publicly released information about the overseas incident at midday Wednesday, but staff hadn't yet told the president.",
      "Asked if he had been briefed, Mr. Trump told the reporter: \"No, I haven't,\" before moving on to the next press question. Mr. Trump typically chooses to not receive daily classified intelligence briefings, unlike past presidents. The search for the soldiers was continuing Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, the White House still hadn't ruled out ousting someone over the Signal incident, sources said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, the president \"continues to have confidence in his national security team.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump is still unhappy with Waltz, as are some other top White House and Cabinet officials, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, sent a letter Thursday asking the acting inspector general for the Defense Department to conduct an inquiry into the incident and brief senators.",
      "It was Waltz who added Goldberg to the Signal chain, sources said. Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong, who has been taking fire from staunch Trump supporters and the conservative media over the incident, wasn't involved in setting up the chat, although he was a participant in the conversation, sources said.",
      "Senior officials don't think there was anything nefarious in adding the journalist to the chat \u2014 they believe it was inadvertent. A review of the incident by Elon Musk continued Thursday.",

    "summary": "The comments come amid two more high-profile detentions by ICE of a Tufts University student and a University of Alabama student.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that 300 student visas have been revoked, asserting \"we have a right\" to rescind the visas of students who participate in campus protests, despite questions about due process and First Amendment objections.",
      "\"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa,\" Rubio said. \"If you lie to us and get a visa then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa.\"",
      "Rubio continued that if a student then lost his or her visa, \"you're no longer legally in the United States. And we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country.\"",
      "Rubio said that at least 300 students had their visas revoked. \"We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" he said.",
      "It's unclear if these students were notified of the revocations in advance.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about\u00a0Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Massachusetts on Tuesday.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk was one of four university students who was listed as the author of a March 2024 campus newspaper opinion piece urging Tufts to adopt resolutions from the student government to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" That article does not mention Hamas.",
      "Ozturk is currently being held at a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "The university said in a statement that she had been returning from a Ramadan iftar dinner when she was detained.\u00a0Surveillance video\u00a0showed she was taken into custody by six ICE agents who appear wearing masks and plain clothes and driving unmarked cars.",
      "A\u00a0University of Alabama doctoral student\u00a0originally from Iran was also taken into custody on Tuesday, according to the university. A search of an ICE database showed the student, Alireza Doroudi, was in custody. It was unclear as of Thursday why he was being detained or where he was being held.",
      "Both Ozturk and Doroudi were in the U.S. on F-1 visas, which allow international students to enter the country to study full-time at American universities.",
      "Labor unions representing university professors on Wednesday filed a lawsuit claiming the detentions of noncitizen students and faculty is a violation of the First Amendment, as is the threat to remove Columbia University's $400 million in federal funds if the university did not make changes.",
      "The lawsuit cites President Trump's March 4 post on social media that those participating in \"illegal protests\" would be arrested, saying that \"under First Amendment doctrine, the category 'illegal protests' is carefully circumscribed.\"",
      "\"Nevertheless, the post did not say how federal officials would identify 'illegal protests' or 'agitators' for purposes of implementing the President's stated policy, nor did it otherwise provide guidance to faculty, students, or administrators seeking to exercise (or allow others to exercise) First Amendment rights while avoiding the risk of imprisonment, deportation, expulsion, arrest, or loss of \"[a]ll\" federal funding,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The high-profile detentions of Ozturk and Doroudi  followed the detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University grad student who had been active in the 2024 campus pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil is a Palestinian born in Syria with a green card, or legal permanent residency, not a student visa. Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said at the time of his detention that an ICE agent said\u00a0they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that Khalil was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "After he was taken into custody, the government said it was invoking a rarely used section of U.S. immigration law to justify Khalil's detention and eventual deportation that allows the secretary of state to make noncitizens subject to deportation if he determines their presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "In a court filing earlier this week, the government also alleged that\u00a0Khalil failed to disclose on his immigration forms\u00a0his involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office of the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "The government also said in the filing that claims by Khalil's attorneys that his detention violated the First Amendment were a \"red herring.\"",
      "Khalil is currently in custody in a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "Rubio said after Khalil was taken into custody that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "When asked on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" if Rubio could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "Rubio said Khalil is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",

      "\"The Government of Canada has launched an educational campaign to inform Americans of the economic impacts of tariffs. The campaign is a strategic investment in Canada's long-term economic interests, and its trade relationship with the United States,\" Babcock said. \"Tariffs are a tax on hard-working Americans in their daily lives. They lead to increased costs on everyday essentials, including fuel and groceries. The purpose is to increase the understanding of the American public and to counter misinformation.\"",
      "President Trump's tariffs were answered by Canada, who then implemented tariffs against the United States. Mr. Trump proposed 25% tariffs on the country and on all steel and aluminum imports. In response, Canada threatened to implement nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would raise the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50%, but retracted that proposal and stayed at the 25% rate.",
      "Earlier this month, Ontario announced it was adding a 25% surcharge on all electricity exports\u00a0sent to the U.S. That surcharge would have affected consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, but then Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced Canada would suspend that plan and the Trump administration backed off doubling Canadian steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "In his latest move, Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. Experts say targeting imported cars could also strain ties with key trading U.S. partners, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Europe. Half of the cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.",

    "summary": "Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, penned a letter seeking an expedited inspector general report on the Signal chat leak.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Wicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "Separately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ordered the administration officials who were part of the Signal chat to preserve all messages exchanged on the platform from March 11 to March 15 \u2014 the time frame during which the app was used to discuss the strikes in Yemen.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg represented agreement between the Justice Department and American Oversight, a watchdog group that had sued and claimed officials failed to follow federal recordkeeping laws. Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a declaration from a top lawyer at the Treasury Department who said the messages had been preserved.",
      "\"We're committed to preserving what the agencies have,\" Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer, told Boasberg.",
      "She said the department is working with the agencies to determine the records they have and ensure they are maintained as required by law.",
      "The judge, who has faced attacks by the president over his decision in a separate case, told the parties that the government is \"moving toward implementing what the plaintiffs seek.\"",
      "\"What I see here is a real chance to reach common ground on a number of the issues raised,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Elise Stefanik's nomination to be U.N. ambassador has been withdrawn, President Trump confirmed Thursday, with the president saying he's asked her to remain in Congress.",
      "The president's decision to pull her nomination ends two months of limbo for the New York Republican.",
      "\"As we advance our America First Agenda, it is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News reported her nomination was in jeopardy as GOP pressure mounted for her to back away from the position.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News there were ongoing discussions about whether she should withdraw from consideration. Stefanik had not resigned from her seat in Congress, and with the narrow majority in the House, Republicans need all the votes they can muster. House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.",
      "Republicans hold just 218 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 213 seats. There are currently four vacant seats. After the president's announcement, Johnson acknowledged the Republicans' slim majority on social media as he hailed Stefanik's \"selfless decision.\"",
      "\"It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise's agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies,\" Johnson said on social platform X, calling Stefanik \"a great leader and a devoted patriot.\"",
      "The speaker said he would invite Stefanik to return to the House Republicans' leadership team immediately.",
      "Democrats pounced on the withdrawal, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries noting Mr. Trump's margin of victory in Stefanik's district during November's presidential election.",
      "\"Donald Trump won the Elise Stefanik district by 21 points in November 2024. He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?\"",
      "In the Senate, there was little doubt Stefanik would have the votes to be confirmed. Her nomination was advanced by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 30.",
      "Republicans had discussed waiting to take further action on Stefanik's nomination to see how the Florida special elections go on April 1 for two vacant GOP seats. Both are expected to remain in Republican control.",
      "Stefanik did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Stefanik\u00a0has been among President Trump's most faithful allies and was the second nominee he announced for a Senate-confirmed position after the 2024 election. She was elected to Congress in 2014 and rose to House GOP leadership to be the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Soon after the revelation that the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic had inadvertently been added to a Signal chat with top Trump administration officials about Yemen attack plans, some of those officials began changing or deleting their Venmo accounts. At least one account remained public for a day after the Atlantic report.",
      "Venmo, an Internet-based mobile payment service owned by PayPal that allows users to send and receive money quickly, also allows the public to view users' contacts if they do not change their privacy settings.",
      "National security experts contend the public information could be exploited by foreign intelligence services or other nefarious actors.",
      "According to screenshots obtained by CBS News, White House national security adviser Michael Waltz's friends list on Venmo was open to the public to view as late as Tuesday \u2014 a day after the Atlantic report about the Signal chat was published. On Wednesday, his account settings were changed to make his contacts private.",
      "Waltz's contacts on Venmo included journalists, government officials, active and retired service members and members of congress. There was no evidence Waltz had sent or received payments on the platform.",
      "Susie Wiles, President Trump's chief of staff, was listed on Waltz's Venmo friends list, but her account is now no longer searchable. On Wednesday, Wired magazine reported on Waltz' and Wiles' Venmo accounts and said their respective accounts were made private after the publication contacted the White House.",
      "\"Venmo is a commonly used app, and Mike Waltz has made necessary updates for his personal privacy protection,\" said NSC spokesman James Hewitt, after being contacted by CBS News Wednesday.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced a barrage of criticism this week for sharing details on the Signal chat about the March 15 U.S. strike on Iranian-backed Houthis, had an account in early March, but it has since been deactivated, CBS News has learned.",
      "In February, reporters with The American Prospect, a progressive political and public policy magazine, found that Hegseth's Venmo was previously left open for the public to view contacts he had in his cellphone who also had Venmo accounts. Among the contacts were defense contractors, UnitedHealth executives, fellow veterans and colleagues at Fox News.",
      "The Pentagon has not responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Joe Kent, who is Mr. Trump's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center, was on the Signal chat as a point of contact for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and his Venmo account was open for the public to view as of Thursday morning.",
      "The office of the director of national intelligence has not replied to a request for comment.",
      "Der Spiegel reported Wednesday that private contact details for Waltz, Gabbard and Hegseth had been leaked online. Reporters from the German news publication were able to find mobile phone numbers, email addresses and even some passwords belonging to the senior Trump officials with most of the numbers and email addresses still in use.",
      "On Wednesday, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in the group chat in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee at a hearing focused on the global security threats facing the United States.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers. On Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe both said they were not aware of any information that was shared in the chat regarding weapons packages, targets or timing. The Atlantic on Wednesday released more of the texts on those topics after officials on the chat stated repeatedly that nothing disclosed in the Signal group was classified.",
      "The messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week have all contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted. The NSA bulletin was widely distributed to NSA employees a month before the Signal chatroom was created by Waltz.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",

      "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday visited the high-security El Salvador prison where Venezuelans who the Trump administration alleges are gang members have been held since their removal from the United States. The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem's trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \"worst of the worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses while presenting little evidence that they were part of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so.",
      "\"We're going to let the courts play out,\" she told reporters following the visit.",
      "Noem toured an area holding some of the Venezuelans accused of being gang members. In the sweltering building, the men in white T-shirts and shorts stared silently from their cell, then were heard shouting an indiscernible chant when she left.",
      "In a cell block holding Salvadoran prisoners, about a dozen were lined up by guards near the front of their cell and told to remove their T-shirts and face masks. The men were heavily tattooed, some bearing the letters MS, for the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on their chests.",
      "After listening to Salvadoran officials, Noem turned her back to the cell and recorded a video message.",
      "If an immigrant commits a crime, \"this is one of the consequences you could face,\" Noem said. \"First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.\"",
      "Noem also met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has gained right-wing admiration in the U.S. due to his crackdown on the country's gangs, despite the democratic and due process implications that have come with it.",
      "\"This unprecedented relationship we have with El Salvador is going to be a model for other countries on how they can work with America,\" Noem said to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Since taking office, Noem has frequently been front and center in efforts to highlight the immigration crackdown. She took part in immigration enforcement operations, rode horses with Border Patrol agents and was the face of a television campaign warning people in the country illegally to self-deport.",
      "Noem's Wednesday visit is part of a three-day trip. She'll also travel to Colombia and Mexico.",
      "The Venezuelans were removed from the U.S. this month after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and said the U.S. was being invaded by the Tren de Aragua gang. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president wartime powers and allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "An appeals court Wednesday kept in place an order barring the administration from deporting more Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "A central outstanding question about the deportees' status is when and how they could ever be released from the prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, as they are not serving sentences. They no longer appear in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator and have not appeared before a judge in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration refers to them as the \"worst of the worst\" but hasn't identified who was deported or provided evidence that they're gang members.",
      "Relatives of some of the deportees have categorically denied any gang affiliation. The Venezuelan government and a group called the Families of Immigrants Committee in Venezuela hired a lawyer to help free those held in El Salvador. A lawyer for the firm, which currently represents about 30 Venezuelans, said they aren't gang members and have no criminal records.",
      "The U.S. government has acknowledged that many do not have such records.",
      "Flights were in the air March 15 when a federal judge issued a verbal order temporarily barring the deportations and ordered planes to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the judge's verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that about 261 people were deported on the flights, including 137 under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bukele opened the prison in 2023 as he made the Central American country's stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners.",
      "Prisoners can't have visitors. There are no workshops or educational programs.",
      "El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have consular support from their government.",
      "Video released by El Salvador's government after the deportees' arrival showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down.",
      "They were later shown at the prison kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison's all-white uniform \u2014 knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs \u2014 and placed in cells.",
      "For three years, El Salvador has been operating under a state of emergency that suspends fundamental rights as Bukele wages an all-out assault on the country's powerful street gangs. During that time, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties and jailed, often without due process.",

      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",

      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Signal group chat that conveyed details of the timing and weapons descriptions of a planned attack against the Houthis in Yemen included the names or initials of 18 Trump officials and, of course, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who published his account of the messages.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council has confirmed that the message thread \"appears to be authentic,\" and none of the reported participants has denied their appearance in the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee have asked the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the incident.",
      "So who are the officials whose contacts appear in the Signal chat, and what do they do?",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz",
      "Goldberg said that on Tuesday, March 11, he received a connection request on Signal, from a user identified as Michael Waltz. That turned out to be national security adviser Michael Waltz, a top adviser to the president.",
      "\"Two days later\u2014Thursday\u2014at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group,\" Goldberg wrote. \"It was called the 'Houthi PC small group.'\"",
      "Waltz launched the group's conversation, saying, according to The Atlantic: \"Team \u2013 establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours.\"",
      "As national security adviser, Waltz is a presidential appointee and does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "President Trump told NBC he still has confidence in Waltz, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Waltz said\u00a0he took \"full responsibility\" and that he \"built\" the Signal chat group, but he also said he did not have Goldberg's contact information and he didn't know how Goldberg got into the chat. Goldberg said he received a Signal request from a user identified as \"Michael Waltz.\" And soon after, a screenshot Goldberg provided said, \"Michael Waltz added you to the group.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic. Neither the White House nor Hegseth has disputed the authenticity of Hegseth's communication, but they have insisted it doesn't constitute \"war plans.\"",
      "As the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance",
      "Vice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"",
      "Since The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"",
      "As vice president, Vance is not only second in line to the presidency, but a key adviser on virtually all matters of domestic and foreign policy to the president.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"",
      "In his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "\"TG\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard",
      "A user called \"TG\" in the Signal chat appears to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, The Atlantic reported. In congressional testimony this week, Gabbard did not deny that she was in the message chain, but she said she was \"not directly involved\" in the part of the chat that discussed attack plans.",
      "As the director of national intelligence, Gabbard is a Cabinet-level head of the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "Gabbard testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, where she said Signal came pre-installed on government devices.",
      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff",
      "The name Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, also appears in the chat.",
      "Witkoff was in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin during part of the period leading up to the attack.",
      "Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Witkoff didn't have his personal device or government phone with him in Moscow, and that he was given access to a \"classified protected server\" by the U.S. government and was \"very careful\" about his communications while in Russia.",
      "In his own social media post Wednesday, Witkoff said he had \"no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "Witkoff had little communication in the chat.",
      "Scott B.",
      "Scott B. appears to be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to The Atlantic. The Scott B. account designated someone from the Treasury Department to be his point of contact for matters related to the strike. The Treasury Department oversees things like sanctions.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles",
      "The name of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles is a contact in the Signal group, although the screenshots The Atlantic published don't include contributions from Wiles' name.",
      "As the White House chief of staff, Wiles is responsible for managing the president's senior staff as well as overseeing the execution of his agenda.",
      "\"MAR\" \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio",
      "The name \"MAR\" appears twice in the contacts list. The Atlantic points out the secretary of state's full name is Marco Antonio Rubio, and \"MAR\" chimed in on behalf of the State Department.",
      "On Wednesday, Rubio confirmed his presence in the chat, saying he only contributed twice.",
      "\"I can speak to myself for my presence on it \u2014 I think my role on it was just speaking for my role,\" Rubio said. \"I contributed to it twice. I identified my point of contact, which is my chief of staff. And then later on, I think three hours after the White House's official announcements have been made, I congratulated the members of the team.\"",
      "In the chain, \"MAR\" designates Mike Needham to be the State Department's point of contact, and Needham's account converses in the chat. Needham is Rubio's counselor and chief of staff.",
      "Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong",
      "Alex Wong is Waltz' deputy. In his initial messages, Waltz said Wong was \"pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency chief of staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning.\"",
      "Joe Kent",
      "Mr. Trump tapped former Green Beret Joe Kent to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, and Kent's name appears in the Signal chat. In the chat, Gabbard designated Kent to be the point of contact for her Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Others",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026.\u00a0The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",

      "President Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive action to overhaul U.S. elections that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandate that all ballots be received by Election Day across the country.",
      "The order claims the U.S. has \"not adequately enforced Federal election requirements,\" citing as examples \"prohibit[ing] States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit[ing] non-citizens from registering to vote.\"",
      "The order says the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protections\" and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. The president also threatened to pull federal funding from states where election officials are not in compliance.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\" He said it \"seeks to seize authority over election technology and processes at the state and local level ... all while bypassing congressional approval.\"",
      "If implemented, it could cost state taxpayers tens of billions, he predicted, though Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, also expects the executive order to face a difficult road in the courts.",

      "The executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies, like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, provide election support. The commission distributes grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.",
      "In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew\u00a0complaints from Republicans\u00a0who called it federal overreach. Mr. Trump rescinded that order.",
      "Mr. Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity. It states that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. The order also advises the commission to condition funding to states on these new guidelines.",
      "Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Mr. Trump for the executive order, calling it a \"great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.\"",

      "\"This ... is money that had been going to state, local, territorial, tribal health departments across the country, and as we know, as was the case with a lot of COVID funding, it was not just supporting COVID-related programs, but many other things,\" she said, noting wastewater surveillance\u00a0as one example of what's being lost with these cuts, which helps experts look for infectious diseases and other toxins in the water.",
      "\"This has direct applications to the measles outbreak in West Texas right now. It gives us an early warning system for where there might be measles in other areas, where they need to be focusing measles vaccinations, and that program is falling victim to this,\" Gounder said. \"And state (and) local health departments really depend on that CDC money. The CDC functions as a funnel of funding to the state and local level, and in some cases, it's 90% of their budget.\"",
      "Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said much of the funding was set to end soon anyway. \"It's ending in the next six months,\" she said. \"There's no reason \u2014 why rescind it now? It's just cruel and unusual behavior.\"",
      "Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement, \"We learned yesterday that the federal government has unilaterally terminated approximately $226 million in grants to Minnesota Department of Health related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This termination is effective immediately and impacts ongoing work and contracts. This action was sudden and unexpected.\"",
      "She added, \"It will take time to figure out all of the impacts of this action, but these cuts are a tremendous loss \u2014 made worse by the uncertainty and chaos that our federal partners have introduced into this process.\"",
      "California Department of Public Health Director and State Public Health Officer Dr. Erica Pan said in a statement the department \"received notice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that it intends to immediately end state and local public health funding awarded during COVID-19 that supports respiratory virus monitoring, testing and response, immunizations and vaccines for children, and health disparities efforts.\"",
      "\"This funding supports the public health work and data systems improved during the pandemic that helped California fill gaps in its existing public health infrastructure, including ongoing response to COVID-19 disease and other respiratory and vaccine-preventable diseases that require similar resources,\" Pan said. \"We are working to evaluate the impact of these actions. All Californians deserve to live in healthy and thriving communities, which is the role of public health. CDPH remains committed to seeking the resources required to support the critical, lifesaving infrastructure needed to keep people healthy and protect them against infectious disease, vaccine-preventable diseases and health emergencies.\"",
      "In a related move, more than two dozen COVID-related research grants funded by the National Institutes of Health have been canceled. Earlier this month, the Trump administration shut down ordering from covidtest.gov, the site where Americans could have COVID-19 tests delivered to their mailboxes for no charge.",
      "Although the COVID federal public health emergency has ended, the virus is still killing Americans: 458 people per week on average have died from COVID over the past four weeks,\u00a0according to CDC data.",
      "HHS wouldn't provide many details about how the federal government expects to recover the money from what it called \"impacted recipients.\" But HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an email: \"The $11.4 billion is undisbursed funds remaining.\"",
      "Freeman said her understanding is that state health departments already had the COVID money.",
      "\"The funding was authorized by Congress, was appropriated by Congress, and it was out the door, basically, into the hands of the grantees\" \u2014 states, she said, which decide how to distribute it locally.",
      "Under both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, billions of dollars was allocated for COVID response through legislation, including a COVID relief bill and the American Rescue Plan Act.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld by a federal appeals court on March 26. A White House spokesperson said it plans to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, who temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, has questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese decent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency is no longer publishing details of canceled U.S. Agency for International Development contracts due to what's described as \"legal reason[s]\" on its website.",
      "The change is \"related to ongoing litigation,\" a White House administration official told CBS News. It is not clear which litigation challenging the dismantling of USAID caused DOGE to remove information about canceled contracts from its \"Wall of Receipts\" site. The official did not respond when asked for more information.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the 3,214 USAID contracts listed on DOGE's website contain no information other than the total contract value and the amount DOGE claims to have saved by canceling them. The canceled USAID contracts represent about 45% of the total number of itemized contracts on DOGE's website, and 57% of the $21.6 billion it claims to have saved from terminated contracts.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that DOGE likely violated the constitution when it acted to shutter USAID. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents DOGE from taking further action related to the shutdown of USAID.",
      "The USAID contracts alone total $12.4 billion in alleged savings, though multiple experts in federal contracting have said the method DOGE is using to calculate savings is flawed. DOGE uses the total potential value of a contract, which is often far higher than the actual amount an agency ends up spending, to estimate savings. The actual amount of funding cut as a result of USAID contract terminations is closer to $6.7 billion as of Tuesday, according to an analysis by former USAID data analyst Brian Banks.",
      "Multiple news outlets, including CBS News, have also identified errors in DOGE's accounting, with some contracts being double or triple counted. Many of the original errors have been removed but it's not clear if they are still included in the total $103 billion DOGE has claimed to have saved.",
      "DOGE, led by billionaire and President Trump's senior adviser Elon Musk, originally touted the list of canceled contracts as evidence of increased transparency.",
      "\"We're very public with what we do,\" Musk said in an interview with Ted Cruz on March 17. \"I don't know how we could be more transparent. Literally every action that we do, small or large, we post on the DOGE.gov website.\"",
      "With the removal of the USAID contract details, it's unclear what international aid programs the task force is ending.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of over 5,000 terminated USAID grants, awards and contracts, up to date as of March 12. The cancellations included at least $1.39 billion in efforts to fight disease and support global health, including $1.1 billion in fighting malaria.

    "story": [
      "The editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, has nothing to say about his relationship with national security adviser Mike Waltz, who inadvertently added him to a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Yemen days ago.",
      "\"I'm just not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz,\" Goldberg told CBS News in an interview Wednesday.",
      "Waltz claimed he has \"never met\" with Goldberg, wouldn't be able to pick him out of a police lineup and trashed his reputation, calling him \"the bottom scum of journalists.\" But photos surfaced online earlier Wednesday of the two together at an event at the French Embassy in 2021.",
      "\"If your eyeballs see us together, then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together,\" Goldberg said of the photos.",
      "Waltz has also suggested that Goldberg somehow added himself to the Signal chat that also included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 or that some other technical mishap that led to the breach. Goldberg called the claims \"crazy.\"",
      "\"This is what happened on March 11,\" Goldberg continued. \"I got a message request from Michael Waltz. I accepted the message request. That's what happened.\" Signal only allows users to add people to chat groups by phone number, QR code or username of the person they wish to add. The Atlantic story published Wednesday included a screenshot that showed Waltz as administrator and \"JG\" as a member of the group chat, named the \"Houthi PC small group.\"",
      "\"If I'm such a nefarious character,\" Goldberg said, \"why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information about the way an administration is contemplating military action? What do they really think is going to happen?\"",
      "Goldberg did not publish the contents of the message thread until more than a week after the Yemen strikes. On Monday, he posted a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat and characterized parts of the conversation about plans to bomb Houthi targets, rather than quoting them directly, citing his concerns that the details were too sensitive to publish. But after the group chat members and President Trump repeatedly denied that the information was classified, Goldberg, after checking with the administration to see if officials wanted anything redacted, published the text messages about the strikes on Wednesday.",
      "The additional messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Goldberg said it's in the public's interest to have the information and be able to judge the incident for themselves.",
      "\"The public has a right to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. There's obvious proof here that national security officials we're talking about real-time intelligence and military information on an open source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing,\" Goldberg said. \"When reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",

    "summary": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe returned to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after\u00a0more text messages came to light\u00a0and revealed new details about what was shared.",
      "The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk.",
      "\"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,\" Himes said.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "\"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that \"war plans\" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.",
      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",
      "Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, \"Russia has proven adaptable and resilient\" and its air forces are \"more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,\" the assessment says.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",
      "It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power \"probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule.\"",
      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being \"more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive.\"",
      "The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran.",
      "The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, \"though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\"",
      "In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un is increasing his stockpile of nuclear warheads and has \"no intention of negotiating away his strategic weapons programs, which he perceives as a guarantor of regime security and national pride.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:14:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The Department of Education's civil rights office says it launched a Title IX probe in Portland, Oregon, after a trans student-athlete won races at a girls' track meet.",
    "story": [
      "Public school administrators in Portland, Oregon, are facing a federal civil rights probe over a transgender student-athlete's alleged participation in a girls' track and field meet last week, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday.",
      "The department's Office of Civil Rights has opened an investigation into Portland's school district and the Oregon School Activities Association, a nonprofit that oversees high school sports statewide. Federal officials accused both the school district and the nonprofit of violating Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination and is used at times to challenge trans women and girls who compete on women's and girls' teams.",
      "In this case, the civil rights office has alleged that Portland Public Schools and the activities association  allowed a trans runner to compete in the girls' division of a March 19 interscholastic track and field competition, potentially undercutting Title IX as the runner took first place in two races. The office also said allowing the trans student to use the girls' locker room during the event may violate the statute.",
      "The civil rights office said it sent letters to Kimberly Armstrong, the superintendent of Portland Public Schools, and the activities association, which is the governing body for the Portland Interscholastic League, to inform them of the probe. The office is specifically looking into the activities association's \"gender identity participation\" policy to determine whether it could violate the terms of Title IX.",
      "That policy, according to the activities association, aims to give students opportunities to participate in athletic programs that align with their gender identities, while also upholding safe and fair standards for all students. Developed with the Oregon Department of Education, the activities association  says its policy \"promotes harmony and fair competition among member schools by maintaining equality of eligibility\" and gives more students a chance to participate in interscholastic activities.",
      "The federal civil rights office said it launched the investigation after receiving a complaint that blamed the school district and the activities association  for allegedly allowing an athlete not assigned female at birth \"to compete in the girls' track and field division over the last two seasons.\" The complaint noted the trans runner had won two races \u2014 the girls' 200-meter and 400-meter \u2014 at an interscholastic championship meet in Portland last year and again this year.",
      "\"We will not allow the Portland Public Schools District or any other educational entity that receives federal funds to trample on the antidiscrimination protections that women and girls are guaranteed under law,\" Craig Trainor, the Education Department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. \"OCR will use every lawful means to ensure that no female athlete is denied equal athletic opportunities or robbed of her rightful accolades.\"",
      "President Trump's return to office in January, and subsequent executive order declaring that \"only two sexes\" will be recognized by the federal government, set the stage for these kinds of investigations to move forward. Standing against the ability of trans athletes to compete in girls' or women's sports was a substantial part of his election campaign, as it had already become a political flashpoint for a number of Republican leaders.",
      "A spokesperson for the activities association told CBS News Wednesday that the organization had just learned about the federal investigation and was consulting its legal counsel to respond to the Department of Education. Armstrong, from the Portland school district, acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the federal civil rights office did receive a complaint, sparking the probe. She said Portland Public Schools \"is fully cooperating with the investigation.\"",
      "\"I stand firm in our legal responsibilities, and I deeply value every student's right to be treated with dignity, safety, and respect,\" her statement continued. Citing \"this complex legal landscape,\" Armstrong added that the district's policies comply with Oregon state laws, \"which may differ from federal guidance.\"",
      "\"While I am limited in what I can share at this time due to the sensitive nature of the matter and our duty to protect student privacy, I want to be clear: my commitment\u2014and our district's commitment\u2014to doing what's right for all students, especially those most vulnerable, remains unwavering,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A federal district court ordered the Department of Education to restore access to grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to intervene in an ongoing dispute over Department of Education grants that were canceled because they funded programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "In a filing with the high court, the Justice Department requested the justices put on hold a temporary order from a lower court requiring the Education Department to restore millions of dollars in grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide relief to the Justice Department and agreed with the district court that the terminations of the grants likely violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "Echoing concerns raised in other emergency appeals filed with the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris took aim at the scope of the lower court's order. The Trump administration has in recent days focused its attacks on nationwide injunctions. More than a dozen have been issued by district courts considering legal challenges to President Trump's policies.",
      "\"This court should put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of Executive Branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions,\" she wrote.",
      "The Justice Department has also asked the Supreme Court to step into court fights over Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship and efforts to fire thousands of federal probationary employees. The high court has yet to act on their bids for emergency relief.",
      "The grant programs at issue in the case, the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, or TQP and SEED, relate to efforts to improve the development and quality of teachers. In early February, the acting education secretary ordered a review of all grant awards to ensure that they did not fund so-called DEI practices, which the Trump administration have said are discriminatory. The review found that 104 grants should be terminated because they conflicted with the department's policy objectives.",
      "Roughly one month after the grants were canceled, the eight states filed a lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order from a federal district judge in Massachusetts. Public and private universities, as well as nonprofit groups, in their states received the TQP and SEED grants from the federal government.",
      "The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 argued that the grant cancellations violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the agency rulemaking process, in part because the Department of Education failed to \"provide a transparent and reasonable explanation for the termination of the grants.\"",
      "The district court in Massachusetts issued a temporary restraining order, initially set to remain in place for 14 days, that ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the grants for all recipients in the states. It also temporarily blocked the Education Department from canceling any further grants for beneficiaries in the challenger states.",
      "While the administration began working to reinstate access to the funds, it asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the lower court's order and allow it to continue with the grant cancellations.",
      "But the 1st Circuit rejected the Department of Education's request. The district court later extended its temporary order to remain in place up to April 7 while it considered a bid for longer-term relief.",
      "The case from Massachusetts is not the only challenge to the Education Department's decision to scrap DEI-related grants. In a second dispute filed in Maryland, a federal district court separately ordered the administration to reinstate canceled TQP and SEED grants for members of teacher-education groups.",
      "In its bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration warned that the two orders from courts in Maryland and Massachusetts potentially overlap. The government reiterated its opposition to the broad injunctions that have been issued by district courts in the slew of cases.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the Executive Branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the Executive Branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" Harris wrote.",
      "She argued that the temporary restraining order gives relief to all grant recipients in the states, instead of limiting it to the states or their instrumentalities. The district court, Harris wrote, directed a federal agency and its leaders to immediately make available millions of dollars to fund programs that they determined do not align with the administration's objectives.",
      "\"That is a remarkable intrusion on the operations of the Executive Branch, and the kind of judicial action that this court has routinely decided to review,\" she said.",
      "On the merits of the case, the acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, said the Massachusetts court did not have jurisdiction to consider the states' claims, since the case is effectively a contract dispute that should be heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court was considering a challenge to a 2022 regulation that sought to regulate ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, delivering a win for federal efforts to curb gun violence.",
      "The high court ruled 7-2 in finding that the rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is not facially inconsistent with federal firearms law. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the opinion for the majority.",
      "\"The GCA embraces, and thus permits ATF to regulate, some weapon parts kits and unfinished frames or receivers, including those we have discussed,\" Gorsuch wrote, referencing the Gun Control Act of 1968.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court did not involve the Second Amendment, but whether ATF went too far when it issued the rule subjecting ghost guns to the same requirements as commercial firearms.",
      "It follows a decision from the high court last year that struck down a measure from the first Trump administration that outlawed bump stocks, which are devices that increase a firearm's rate of fire. It's unclear whether President Trump will keep the regulation in place or take steps to rescind it.",
      "Gorsuch's opinion included images of a \"Buy Build Shoot\" weapon parts kit from Polymer80, a seller of the kits, and a completed firearm constructed from the parts. He called the finished product \"an instrument of combat.\"",
      "\"No one would confuse the semiautomatic pistol pictured above with a tool or a toy,\" he wrote. \"Of course, as sold, the kit requires some assembly. But a number of considerations persuade us that, even as sold, the 'Buy Build Shoot' kit qualifies as a 'weapon.'\"",
      "Gorsuch acknowledged that while it may take roughly 30 minutes to construct a firearm out of the kit, it \"comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious.\"",
      "\"Really, the kit's name says it all: 'Buy Build Shoot,'\" he wrote.",
      "Writing in dissent, Thomas accused the majority of rewriting the law to regulate weapon parts kits and said it \"blesses the government's overreach based on a series of errors.\"",
      "\"Congress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one. But, it did not,\" he said. \"I would adhere to the words Congress enacted.\"",
      "Gun violence prevention groups cheered the Supreme Court's decision, calling it a victory for public safety.",
      "\"Ghost guns are the gun industry's way of skirting commonsense gun laws and arming dangerous people without background checks. We are thrilled that the Supreme Court has upheld the ATF rule that treats ghost guns as what they are: guns,\" said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel, Giffords Law Center, in a statement.",
      "The court was considering an appeal from the Biden administration of a lower court ruling that struck down the measure.",
      "The regulation, issued in 2022, sought to address a surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, which can be made with 3D printers or kits and parts available online. The weapons don't have serial numbers or transfer records, making them difficult for law enforcement to trace and attractive to people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms.",
      "The rule clarified the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to include a weapon parts kit that can be assembled into an operational weapon in less than 30 minutes, and the incomplete frame of a handgun or receiver of a rifle.",
      "By seeking to regulate the kits under the decades-old law, the rule subjects ghost gun manufacturers and sellers to the same requirements as commercial gun makers, meaning they have to be licensed, mark their products with serial numbers, maintain certain records and run background checks on interested buyers.",
      "Shortly before the regulation took effect, gun owners, advocacy groups and the makers of parts kits challenged it in federal court, arguing that ATF didn't have the authority to change the definition of \"firearm\" to cover weapon parts kits.",
      "A federal district court judge and a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit struck down the rule. The appeals court found that Congress did not authorize ATF to regulate kits under the Gun Control Act.",

      "A group of major U.S. cities also said the regulation has been effective at reducing the use of ghost guns in their municipalities. In New York, ghost gun recoveries fell in 2023 for the first time in four years, and in Baltimore, they decreased in 2023 for the first time since 2019.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act, the Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday.",
      "\"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government's ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,\" the nonpartisan budget office said Wednesday.",
      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations. The department is currently utilizing so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to delay a default for several months.",
      "The CBO analysis noted that if the government's borrowing needs are \"significantly greater\" than projections, the Treasury Department's resources could be exhausted as early as late May or June.",
      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders have weighed how to address the issue. Last month, the House included a provision that would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion in its budget proposal, which serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. But the Senate has been pursuing a different budget measure that does not include a debt limit increase.",
      "In recent days, Republicans in Congress have been working to reconcile the two approaches as they look to make headway on the complicated process to implement the president's agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met Tuesday afternoon with top tax leaders as they work to unite behind a plan on the path forward. And Thune told reporters he's hopeful lawmakers will be able to address the debt limit as part of the budget process.",

      "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce is tasked with helping to manage commercial and military satellite traffic in space to help guard against collisions, as well as licensing and regulating commercial satellite systems. The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",
      "Its already small team lost eight employees in the initial round of layoffs in late February, representing around 30% of its staff, according to multiple sources. Since then, three staffers in leadership roles were brought back, but lawmakers still worry about the impact.",
      "The members of Congress are calling for all fired employees within the office to be reinstated permanently. Earlier this month, fired employees were placed on administrative leave after their firings were blocked by a federal court ruling.",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, obtained by CBS News, lawmakers including the committee's ranking member Zoe Lofgren, of California, say the firings could compromise the office's public safety programs and risk hurting U.S. leadership in space.",
      "They also question whether there's a conflict of interest given Trump adviser and DOGE leader Elon Musk's stake in SpaceX.",
      "\"If OSC is gutted, the harm to America's economy, its national security, and its public safety will leave everyone worse off \u2014 except perhaps for SpaceX, whose size and scale will allow it to mitigate the damage done to the rest of the commercial space sector,\" reads the letter in part.",
      "\"As the largest and most profitable commercial satellite operator, SpaceX has already achieved a size and scale that far surpasses its competitors, thereby positioning the company to withstand market disruptions and uncertainty with much greater ease than its less-established rivals,\" it continues.",

      "Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who served as acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration, called the cuts \"self-defeating,\" since the office was established to help support a growing commercial space sector. Gallaudet now works as a consultant for space companies.",
      "\"One of our goals, broadly, was to support these growing tech industries. One of them was space, and we grew,\" Gallaudet told CBS News. \"If that office has employees fired, that means it's going to take more time for them to issue licenses to new companies.\"",
      "Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's conservative policy playbook, even called for Republicans to \"elevate\" the Office of Space Commerce, saying the office \"should be the vehicle for a new Administration to set a robust and unified whole-of-government commercial space policy that cements U.S. leadership in one of the most crucial industries of the future.\"",
      "One of the employees who remains on leave, Cole Donovan, served as an international affairs specialist within the Office of Space Commerce. His work focused on regulations and coordination between private space companies in the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"For my division, specifically, we don't have an expert anymore on EU law and EU regulation,\" he said. \"We had been helping U.S. companies navigate that process.\"",

    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

      "The National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees in February 2025 warning them of vulnerabilities in using the encrypted messaging application Signal, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "News of the NSA bulletin comes amid the continued fallout from an explosive article published Monday in The Atlantic. The publication's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, detailed how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth inadvertently disclosed war plans to him in an encrypted Signal chat group two hours before the U.S. military launched attacks against Houthi militia in Yemen. Goldberg wrote that Hegseth's messages included \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\"",
      "The NSA is an arm of the Defense Department and specializes in signals intelligence \u2014 which is derived from electronic transmissions \u2014 and cybersecurity. The agency is responsible for monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for U.S. national security interests.",
      "The unclassified but for-official-use-only documents provided to CBS News by a senior U.S. intelligence official are entitled \"Signal Vulnerability\" and were sent out the month before Goldberg was accidentally added to the group chat allegedly by national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin begins.",
      "The bulletin warned of Russian professional hacking groups employing phishing scams to gain access to encrypted conversations, bypassing the end-to-end encryption the application uses.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",
      "CBS News contacted the NSA for comment but did not receive a reply prior to publication.",
      "Signal responded to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were reportedly in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate panel.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. But the NSA bulletin advises that even information that is not categorized as classified should not be shared on Signal, advising users not to share \"unclassified, nonpublic\" information on the messaging platform.",
      "Ratcliffe said Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials. The group chat, Ratcliffe said, was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were asked by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",

    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced\u00a025% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S. The new duties could lead to sticker shock on a wide range of automobiles for American consumers, including those manufactured in the United States, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\"\u00a0 Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries, goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-trump-presidential-exemption-clean-air/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The EPA announced that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act by emailing President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "In its latest move to dismantle environmental regulation under the Trump Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act and other rules designed to limit air pollution with a simple offer: email us for a presidential exemption.",
      "Businesses that would like to avoid complying with certain EPA rules can email the agency with a reason justifying why it should be allowed an exemption and how it is in the best interest of the national security of the United States. According to the EPA website, all emails do not entitle the submitter to an exemption, but the president \"will make a decision\" based on the merits of the request.",
      "The EPA said in a statement to CBS News that section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act \"specifically states that the President may exempt any stationary source 'if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.'\"",
      "But many in the environmental sector were stunned by the proposal.",
      "\"This section of the Clean Air Act is designed to protect people from exposure to the most toxic chemicals -- the ones that are dangerous in the smallest concentrations,\" environmental law expert Michael Gerrard said in an email. \"It's shocking that EPA is now providing industries with a simple form they can use to get out of these rules and keep on emitting these harmful substances.\"",
      "For years, heavy industry has abided by rules and regulations set by the EPA to comply with the Clean Air Act, which has often led companies to invest heavily in expensive technology to reduce toxic air emissions, an expense critics have often derided as onerous.",
      "So, on March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the \"greatest day of deregulation\" and said the agency was reviewing 31 rules that, he claims, amount to \"trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and hidden taxes.\" The mission of the rollback is to reduce costly regulations that burden the industry. By reviewing the rules, Zeldin said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that \"As we unleash American energy, revitalize domestic manufacturing, cut costs for families, and restore the rule of law, we do so with the firm belief that America's greatest days lie ahead.\"",
      "The rollbacks were cheered by Republican leaders and industry alike, \"The action taken by the Trump EPA today is exactly what needs to be done to secure American energy dominance and restore the communities who have been negatively impacted by regulations and overreach from the Biden administration,\" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said in a statement. Capito is also the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the EPA.",
      "It could take years for the agency to finalize new rules to reduce the costs of environmental compliance, let alone the legal challenges it will face. In an attempt to fast-track this process, the EPA is offering this unique \"hall pass,\" as some describe the presidential exemption, to enable companies to stop complying now, rather than years later when the updated rules are complete.",
      "\"Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA is now the Environmental Polluter Agency. His invitation for companies to put arsenic and mercury into the air if they claim it enhances 'national security' is a vast abuse of the President's given authority,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said in a statement to CBS News. Merkley also sits on the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and its first priority is to review legislation on air pollution.",
      "Merkley's fellow committee member, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), had similar concerns, \"Trump and his puppets at EPA are giving the most toxic polluters carte blanche to poison our air,\" he said in an email to CBS News. \" As corrupt as this is, no one can have any confidence that either the technology or national security standards will be met.\"",
      "Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement, \"The idea that some obscure, rarely-used provision of the Clean Air Act empowers EPA to grant sweeping exemptions to polluting companies because they send an email is preposterous. It's clearly illegal - no doubt there.\"",
      "Environmental law experts believe the policy will be challenged in court. \"I've never seen anything like this before,\" said Mary Nichols, a distinguished counsel for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA Law School. Nichols says because the statute is so broad, it is subject to abuse. \"I think the likely first lawsuit is a blanket challenge to the entire procedure,\" she said.",
      "CBS News asked the EPA if it could explain how all the emails will be processed and assessed, whether each one will be individually considered by President Trump, and how many emails the agency has already received, but the EPA did not address those questions.",
      "But sending the email request to the EPA does create a paper trail that companies may want to consider. \"This is something that we will fight to make public,\" said Joe Bonfiglio, executive director of the U.S. region of the Environmental Defense Fund, a prominent environmental nonprofit. \"For companies who take advantage of this hall pass, there are organizations like ours who will make sure communities around those facilities know about the requests.\"",
      "Companies have until March 31 to email the EPA with the required information for the president to consider.",

      "Trump officials in multiple parts of the department have said they are aiming to implement much of the changes quickly, often within 10 days.",
      "The changes amount to a workforce that will be around 33% smaller than it was at the end of the Biden administration. There were around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records, up from 81,917 at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "Some 10,000 full-time employees will be cut through the layoffs, in addition to other vacant positions that will not be replaced. Thousands of full-time staff have already left the department in recent months, in addition to thousands more contractor and fellowship positions that were also eliminated.",
      "\"When combined with HHS' other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees,\" the department said in a release, estimating that taxpayers would save $1.8 billion from the changes.",
      "A fact sheet shared with reporters and health officials says that \"no additional cuts are currently planned\" beyond those announced Thursday and in recent weeks.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration, according to the fact sheet. The administration is also cutting 1,200 jobs from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\"This reduction will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers, nor will it impact inspectors,\" the fact sheet says of the FDA changes.",
      "At the CDC, the department says the workforce will decline by around 2,400 employees, to \"focus on returning to its core mission of preparing for and respond to epidemics and outbreaks.\" One U.S. official said the cuts are not intended to undermine infectious disease work at the agency.",
      "From the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the workforce will decline by \"approximately 300 employees, with a focus on reducing minor duplication\" at CMS, which had already been facing hiring limits due to a budget crunch in recent years. The reorganization will not impact Medicare or Medicaid services, it says.",
      "The department's reduction-in-force \"is primarily aimed at administrative positions,\" according to a letter sent Thursday to unions in mutliple HHS agencies, but \"will also target roles in high-cost regions\" and who are \"determined to be redundant or duplicative\" with others.",
      "\"Specific notices to employees may be sent as early as Friday, March 28,\" according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy said in video\u00a0annoncement shared Thursday by the department.",

      "Health officials had been bracing for steep cuts to be announced this week, as part of the sweeping restructuring architected with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force.",
      "Several health agency officials said they had seen stepped up security measures coming into work this morning. Managers have largely been in the dark about the changes, officials have said, aside from a handful of changes already announced within the department.",
      "One major change announced earlier this month would result in significantly cutting the number of general counsel offices, shrinking the ranks of the department's attorneys. One health official said the closures would amount to eliminating two-thirds of the HHS regional attorneys.",
      "Kennedy said earlier this week at the White House that the DOGE team headed by billionaire Elon Musk had \"identified extraordinary waste in my department and HHS.\" He cited what they considered duplicated work for communications, procurement, IT and HR departments across 40 operating divisions in HHS.",
      "\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies,\" Kennedy said Monday.",
      "One of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"",
      "\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale. We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of department sand agencies while preserving their core functions,\" Kennedy said in the Thursday video.",

      "This new AHA agency also effectively combines many of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" priorities under one roof, ranging from this year's update to federal dietary guidelines to public health statements about the use of fluoride. The work will be supported by the U.S. surgeon general, the fact sheet says.",
      "Officials within the Health Resources and Services Administration are expecting deep cuts from the merger, including to the agency's human resources and Provider Relief Bureau staff, two officials said.",
      "HRSA's Provider Relief Bureau had been charged with oversight of aid dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic in the health care industry. More than $1 billion in debts to the federal government could go unrecouped if the team's work is left unfinished, one official said.",
      "\"Our budget was already covered with the original funding and would have been recouped five times over, had we been allowed to do our job,\" the official said.",

      "Work from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which had been bracing for as much as 90% of their staff to be cut by DOGE, will be merged with another agency to create the Office of Strategy.",
      "And the functions from the Administration for Community Living targeted at older adults and people with disabilities will be moved to other agencies, the department said, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",

She didn't know where she was going to go yet and then I went to sleep relatively early that night and she sent me a couple of text messages,\" Cilliers, told \"48 Hours\" contributor Jonathan Vigliotti in an interview for\u00a0\"Christy and Hilda's Last Dance,\"\u00a0 now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "The next day, around 7a.m., Cilliers sent his wife a text message to check in, but didn't hear anything back. He thought she'd been out late and was sleeping in. He recalls feeling something wasn't right. The couple shared their locations on their phones by using their \"Share My Location,\" feature on their iPhones. \"We share our phone locations with each other just as a safety feature,\" said Cilliers. He noticed that Giles' phone was pinging at an unfamiliar address, an apartment on 8641 West Olympic Boulevard in West Los Angeles.",
      "Worried, but not yet panicked, Cilliers says he continued to try and reach her. Hours went by and still no word from Giles. \"I still hadn't heard back from her, and I saw her location had suddenly moved to an emergency room hospital \u2026 and at that point, like, I'm in real panic.\"",
      "Within minutes, Cillers' life changed drastically when Giles's phone pinged at the Southern California Medical Center at Culver City, Los Angeles. He called Christy's parents with the information, and a short time later they called him back and learned that his wife of just two years had died after being dropped outside the hospital by two masked men in a car without license plates. Hospital staff told investigators the men claimed to be \"good Samaritans.\" She had died from a drug overdose.",
      "\"When you were told that the cause of death was an overdose, did that add up to you?\" Vigliotti asked. \"Absolutely not \u2026 definitely not something that she would have done to herself ever,\" said Cilliers.",
      "His role as loving husband would suddenly turn to grieving investigator.",
      "\"In less than 24 hours, your world was turned upside down?\" asked Vigliotti. \"Shattered,\" Cilliers replied.",
      "Cilliers wasted no time trying to get answers about what happened to Giles. Armed with the digital trail Giles had left behind, he set to work. He gave investigators a screenshot of the location on West Olympic Boulevard where Christy's phone had been pinging that morning.",
      "Cilliers learned from the friend who had been out with the women that night that she shared phone locations with Cabrales. She told Cilliers that Cabrales' phone was pinging at the exact location where Giles had been, that mysterious address in West Lost Angeles.",
      "She called Cabrales' phone. A man answered and hung up. Afterwards, it just went to voicemail. They later learned that Hilda had also been left at a hospital, Kaiser Permanente, about two miles away from where Christy was taken. She had also suffered a drug overdose and was dying.",
      "\"Obviously, all our alarm bells are going off in our heads when both girls are dropped off at two different hospitals, two hours apart,\" said Cilliers. \"Something terrible happened that night.\"",
      "He took the last known location of both women on West Olympic Blvd and blasted it on social media.",
      "\"I posted her address on Instagram asking if anybody knew and that she had passed away. And I guess the story went like far and wide. A lot of people shared it,\" said Cilliers.",
      "He immediately got leads. \"People got back to me with saying that this guy lives at this address and he's a very like suspicious person, that there's lots of things out on the Internet about him, that he's not a very savory character. \u2026 A lot of really terrible things have been written about him online,\" said Cilliers.",
      "\"Obviously at this point, I know she's passed away, that she was at this person's address all night, all afternoon,\" said Cilliers. \"I knew something like the worst of the worst had happened.\"",
      "Investigators say it was the home of David Pearce, 39, a self-proclaimed \"Hollywood producer.\"",
      "Cilliers checked Giles' laptop: he could see her history of text messages. One, with a wide-eyed emoji, caught his attention: it was in an exchange between Christy and Hilda, where the two women planned to leave the location they'd been taken to and catch an Uber. But that ride never happened.",
      "Cilliers provided detectives with that text, which would soon turn into a key piece of evidence. \"I give as much information as I can to the detectives \u2026 and \u2026 I believe that that night, they knocked on his door for the first time to talk to him.\"",
      "The quest to get to the bottom of what caused his wife's death continued. After combing through social media posts and connecting the dots through conversations with friends, he made a timeline. The women started their night at the Soho House in West Hollywood earlier on Friday evening. Just after midnight, they continued to party. They went to see one of their favorite DJs at a warehouse party in East Los Angeles.",
      "\"I contacted everybody I could at the events that she went to that night and found these photos of these guys hanging out with them,\" Cilliers tells \"48 Hours.\" The photos proved that Pearce was at the same warehouse party, in the VIP section, with Christy and Hilda.",
      "Cilliers continued to put the pieces of the puzzle together. He obtained surveillance video from outside the warehouse location where the women were last seen alive. At 4:51 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 13, 2021, Pearce and his friends are seen leaving the warehouse with Giles and Cabrales. Surveillance images captured them getting into a car that would later be linked to the same location where the women's phones had been pinging all day.",
      "\"I mean it's just confirming my worst fears again that they were there at that place against their will,\" Cilliers tells \"48 Hours.\" \"We wanted to gather as much evidence as we could about exactly what happened \u2026 exactly what caused their death. At that point, we already knew who was responsible.\"",
      "Christy Giles and Hilda Marcela Cabrales both died from a toxic mix of drugs, including cocaine and fentanyl. In Giles's case, GHB \u2013 known as the date rape drug \u2013 was found in her system.",
      "Pearce was charged with two counts of first-degree felony murder for the rape and deaths of Christy Giles and Hilda Marcela Cabrales. He was also charged with seven counts of sexual assault involving seven different women.",
      "On Feb. 4, 2025, Pearce was found guilty of first-degree murder.\u00a0in the deaths of Giles and Cabrales.",
      "Jurors also found Pearce guilty of seven counts of sexual assault for the prior charges.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 National security adviser Mike Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have so far survived the disclosure that they ran a high-level meeting on a military operation via a non-government app and inadvertently included a journalist.",
      "But President Trump continues to privately vent his irritation about it and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout is quieting down, according to sources familiar with the matter. The issue is \"still a hot potato,\" one official told CBS News.",
      "Sources said Mr. Trump has been more irritated that Waltz had the phone number for the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, than he was about the use of the Signal app by top national security officials to discuss coming plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. The magazine published its account on Monday.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, multiple sources said. But in the end, Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump has not asked him to step down, several sources said. Publicly, Mr. Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "The Signal situation, which Waltz called \"a mistake,\" hasn't been the only snafu for the president's team this week. Mr. Trump on Wednesday evening was unaware that four U.S. military members had gone missing the day before in Lithuania until a reporter asked him about it during an on-camera event in the Oval Office.",
      "The Army soldiers went missing early Tuesday during a military exercise. The Pentagon had publicly released information about the overseas incident at midday Wednesday, but staff hadn't yet told the president.",
      "Asked if he had been briefed, Mr. Trump told the reporter: \"No, I haven't,\" before moving on to the next press question. Mr. Trump typically chooses to not receive daily classified intelligence briefings, unlike past presidents. The search for the soldiers was continuing Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, the White House still hadn't ruled out ousting someone over the Signal incident, sources said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, the president \"continues to have confidence in his national security team.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump is still unhappy with Waltz, as are some other top White House and Cabinet officials, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, sent a letter Thursday asking the acting inspector general for the Defense Department to conduct an inquiry into the incident and brief senators.",
      "It was Waltz who added Goldberg to the Signal chain, sources said. Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong, who has been taking fire from staunch Trump supporters and the conservative media over the incident, wasn't involved in setting up the chat, although he was a participant in the conversation, sources said.",
      "Senior officials don't think there was anything nefarious in adding the journalist to the chat \u2014 they believe it was inadvertent. A review of the incident by Elon Musk continued Thursday.",
      "One reason for the public show of confidence in the national security team, several sources said, is that Trump and top officials refuse to hand The Atlantic \u2014 and Democrats \u2014 a perceived victory.",

    "summary": "The comments come amid two more high-profile detentions by ICE of a Tufts University student and a University of Alabama student.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that 300 student visas have been revoked, asserting \"we have a right\" to rescind the visas of students who participate in campus protests, despite questions about due process and First Amendment objections.",
      "\"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa,\" Rubio said. \"If you lie to us and get a visa then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa.\"",
      "Rubio continued that if a student then lost his or her visa, \"you're no longer legally in the United States. And we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country.\"",
      "Rubio said that at least 300 students had their visas revoked. \"We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" he said.",
      "It's unclear if these students were notified of the revocations in advance.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about\u00a0Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Massachusetts on Tuesday.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk was one of four university students who was listed as the author of a March 2024 campus newspaper opinion piece urging Tufts to adopt resolutions from the student government to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" That article does not mention Hamas.",
      "Ozturk is currently being held at a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "The university said in a statement that she had been returning from a Ramadan iftar dinner when she was detained.\u00a0Surveillance video\u00a0showed she was taken into custody by six ICE agents who appear wearing masks and plain clothes and driving unmarked cars.",
      "A\u00a0University of Alabama doctoral student\u00a0originally from Iran was also taken into custody on Tuesday, according to the university. A search of an ICE database showed the student, Alireza Doroudi, was in custody. It was unclear as of Thursday why he was being detained or where he was being held.",
      "Both Ozturk and Doroudi were in the U.S. on F-1 visas, which allow international students to enter the country to study full-time at American universities.",
      "Labor unions representing university professors on Wednesday filed a lawsuit claiming the detentions of noncitizen students and faculty is a violation of the First Amendment, as is the threat to remove Columbia University's $400 million in federal funds if the university did not make changes.",
      "The lawsuit cites President Trump's March 4 post on social media that those participating in \"illegal protests\" would be arrested, saying that \"under First Amendment doctrine, the category 'illegal protests' is carefully circumscribed.\"",
      "\"Nevertheless, the post did not say how federal officials would identify 'illegal protests' or 'agitators' for purposes of implementing the President's stated policy, nor did it otherwise provide guidance to faculty, students, or administrators seeking to exercise (or allow others to exercise) First Amendment rights while avoiding the risk of imprisonment, deportation, expulsion, arrest, or loss of \"[a]ll\" federal funding,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The high-profile detentions of Ozturk and Doroudi  followed the detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University grad student who had been active in the 2024 campus pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil is a Palestinian born in Syria with a green card, or legal permanent residency, not a student visa. Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said at the time of his detention that an ICE agent said\u00a0they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that Khalil was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "After he was taken into custody, the government said it was invoking a rarely used section of U.S. immigration law to justify Khalil's detention and eventual deportation that allows the secretary of state to make noncitizens subject to deportation if he determines their presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "In a court filing earlier this week, the government also alleged that\u00a0Khalil failed to disclose on his immigration forms\u00a0his involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office of the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "The government also said in the filing that claims by Khalil's attorneys that his detention violated the First Amendment were a \"red herring.\"",
      "Khalil is currently in custody in a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "Rubio said after Khalil was taken into custody that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "When asked on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" if Rubio could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "Rubio said Khalil is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said about revoking visas.",

      "CBS News Detroit reached out to the Government of Canada, which paid for the ad, on Wednesday. John Babcock, spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, sent a statement Thursday, saying that the billboards were placed in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, D.C., and surrounding areas.",
      "\"The Government of Canada has launched an educational campaign to inform Americans of the economic impacts of tariffs. The campaign is a strategic investment in Canada's long-term economic interests, and its trade relationship with the United States,\" Babcock said. \"Tariffs are a tax on hard-working Americans in their daily lives. They lead to increased costs on everyday essentials, including fuel and groceries. The purpose is to increase the understanding of the American public and to counter misinformation.\"",
      "President Trump's tariffs were answered by Canada, who then implemented tariffs against the United States. Mr. Trump proposed 25% tariffs on the country and on all steel and aluminum imports. In response, Canada threatened to implement nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs.",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Wicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "Separately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ordered the administration officials who were part of the Signal chat to preserve all messages exchanged on the platform from March 11 to March 15 \u2014 the time frame during which the app was used to discuss the strikes in Yemen.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg represented agreement between the Justice Department and American Oversight, a watchdog group that had sued and claimed officials failed to follow federal recordkeeping laws. Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a declaration from a top lawyer at the Treasury Department who said the messages had been preserved.",
      "\"We're committed to preserving what the agencies have,\" Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer, told Boasberg.",
      "She said the department is working with the agencies to determine the records they have and ensure they are maintained as required by law.",
      "The judge, who has faced attacks by the president over his decision in a separate case, told the parties that the government is \"moving toward implementing what the plaintiffs seek.\"",
      "\"What I see here is a real chance to reach common ground on a number of the issues raised,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

      "The office of the director of national intelligence has not replied to a request for comment.",
      "Der Spiegel reported Wednesday that private contact details for Waltz, Gabbard and Hegseth had been leaked online.

      "Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers. On Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe both said they were not aware of any information that was shared in the chat regarding weapons packages, targets or timing. The Atlantic on Wednesday released more of the texts on those topics after officials on the chat stated repeatedly that nothing disclosed in the Signal group was classified.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday visited the high-security El Salvador prison where Venezuelans who the Trump administration alleges are gang members have been held since their removal from the United States. The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem's trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \"worst of the worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses while presenting little evidence that they were part of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so.",
      "\"We're going to let the courts play out,\" she told reporters following the visit.",
      "Noem toured an area holding some of the Venezuelans accused of being gang members. In the sweltering building, the men in white T-shirts and shorts stared silently from their cell, then were heard shouting an indiscernible chant when she left.",
      "In a cell block holding Salvadoran prisoners, about a dozen were lined up by guards near the front of their cell and told to remove their T-shirts and face masks. The men were heavily tattooed, some bearing the letters MS, for the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on their chests.",
      "After listening to Salvadoran officials, Noem turned her back to the cell and recorded a video message.",
      "If an immigrant commits a crime, \"this is one of the consequences you could face,\" Noem said. \"First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.\"",
      "Noem also met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has gained right-wing admiration in the U.S. due to his crackdown on the country's gangs, despite the democratic and due process implications that have come with it.",
      "\"This unprecedented relationship we have with El Salvador is going to be a model for other countries on how they can work with America,\" Noem said to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Since taking office, Noem has frequently been front and center in efforts to highlight the immigration crackdown. She took part in immigration enforcement operations, rode horses with Border Patrol agents and was the face of a television campaign warning people in the country illegally to self-deport.",
      "Noem's Wednesday visit is part of a three-day trip. She'll also travel to Colombia and Mexico.",
      "The Venezuelans were removed from the U.S. this month after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and said the U.S. was being invaded by the Tren de Aragua gang. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president wartime powers and allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "An appeals court Wednesday kept in place an order barring the administration from deporting more Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "A central outstanding question about the deportees' status is when and how they could ever be released from the prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, as they are not serving sentences. They no longer appear in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator and have not appeared before a judge in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration refers to them as the \"worst of the worst\" but hasn't identified who was deported or provided evidence that they're gang members.",
      "Relatives of some of the deportees have categorically denied any gang affiliation. The Venezuelan government and a group called the Families of Immigrants Committee in Venezuela hired a lawyer to help free those held in El Salvador. A lawyer for the firm, which currently represents about 30 Venezuelans, said they aren't gang members and have no criminal records.",
      "The U.S. government has acknowledged that many do not have such records.",
      "Flights were in the air March 15 when a federal judge issued a verbal order temporarily barring the deportations and ordered planes to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the judge's verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that about 261 people were deported on the flights, including 137 under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bukele opened the prison in 2023 as he made the Central American country's stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners.",
      "Prisoners can't have visitors. There are no workshops or educational programs.",
      "El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have consular support from their government.",
      "Video released by El Salvador's government after the deportees' arrival showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down.",
      "They were later shown at the prison kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison's all-white uniform \u2014 knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs \u2014 and placed in cells.",
      "For three years, El Salvador has been operating under a state of emergency that suspends fundamental rights as Bukele wages an all-out assault on the country's powerful street gangs. During that time, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties and jailed, often without due process.",
      "Bukele offered to hold U.S. deportees in the prison when Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited in February.",
      "At the prison Wednesday, El Salvador Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro showed Noem a cell holding Salvadorans he said had been there since the prison opened. \"No one expects that these people can go back to society and behave,\" he said.",

      "Players will need more than $2 and a dream to play. After the April 4 drawing, tickets will cost $5 each, Mega Millions said in a statement Tuesday. An optional add-on to potentially increase nonjackpot prizes for an additional dollar and a $3 feature for two plays for the jackpot will be discontinued.",
      "In exchange for the higher price, the game boasts better odds for winning. While the odds for winning any prize will improve from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23, the chances of winning the big prize will still be astronomical: going from 1 in 302,575,350 to 1 in 290,472,336. The change will make the odds of winning Mega Millions' jackpot closer to winning Powerball's, where the odds\u00a0are 1 in 292.2 million.",
      "One thing that hasn't changed is people are still less likely to win the jackpot than to be struck by lightning, the odds of which are 1 in 15,300 in a lifetime, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Players win a Mega Millions jackpot by matching the five white balls and the gold Mega Ball. The game's smallest prize is won by matching just the Mega Ball. The changes in the game's odds come from removing one of the Mega Balls.",
      "The size of the prizes are also changing. The jackpot will be a minimum of $50 million, up from $20 million. Mega Millions estimates that the average jackpot win with the new changes will be over $800 million, an increase from about $450 million. A random multiplier will also be added to the smaller prizes.",
      "\"Players who had won $2 in the old game will now take home $10, $15, $20, $25 or $50 under this game,\" Joshua Johnston, lead director of the Mega Millions Consortium, said in a statement. \"Those who had won $500 under the old rules will now take home $1,000; $1,500; $2,000; $2,500 or $5,000 in this new game.\"",

Hodak, 23, was a member of the 93rd Bombardment Squadron in the 19th Bombardment group in March 1945, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Hodak, of Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, was a gunner aboard a B-29 \"Superfortress\" aircraft. These planes had multiple machine guns, held over 20,000 pounds of bombs and were especially suited to fly to Japan from bases in China during World War II, according to the National Museum of the United States Air Force.",
      "Hodak's plane was shot down while on a mission to Tokyo. He was initially reported as missing in action, the DPAA said, but investigators learned he had been captured after the plane was taken down. He was taken to the Tokyo Military Prison.",
      "In late May 1945, U.S. aircraft heavily bombed Tokyo, causing huge fires and burning hundreds of structures, according to Military.com. One of the destroyed buildings was the Tokyo Military Prison. Hodak was among the service members being held there at the time. None of the people imprisoned at the facility survived the blaze, Military.com reported. They were buried in a mass grave.",
      "The American Graves Registration Service disinterred 65 sets of remains from the prison in early 1946, after World War II ended. The service was able to identify 25 sets of remains. One was a Japanese person, the DPAA said. The 39 unidentified sets of remains were interred as Unknowns at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",
      "In 2022, the sets of remains were disinterred again and sent to the DPAA laboratory for analysis. In 2024, the DPAA launched the Tokyo Prison Fire Project.

    "summary": "President Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles not manufactured in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

    "story": [
      "Mari Villar was slammed by a car that jumped the curb, breaking her legs and collapsing a lung. Amy Paulo was in pain from a femur surgery that wasn't healing properly. Katie Kriegshauser suffered organ failure during pregnancy, weakening her so much that she couldn't lift her baby daughter.",
      "All went to physical therapy, but their health insurers stopped paying before any could walk without assistance. Paulo spent nearly $1,500 out of her own pocket for more sessions.",
      "Millions of Americans rely on physical and occupational therapists to regain strength and motor skills after operations, diseases, and injuries. But recoveries are routinely stymied by a widespread constraint in health insurance policies: rigid caps on therapy sessions.",
      "Insurers frequently limit such sessions to as few as 20 a year, a KFF Health News examination finds, even for people with severe damage such as spinal cord injuries and strokes, who may need months of treatment, multiple times a week. Patients can face a bind: Without therapy, they can't return to work, but without working, they can't afford the therapy.",
      "Paulo said she pressed her insurer for more sessions, to no avail. \"I said, 'I'm in pain. I need the services. Is there anything I can do?'\" she recalled. \"They said, no, they can't override the hard limit for the plan.\"",
      "A typical physical therapy session for a privately insured patient to improve daily functioning costs $192 on average, according to the Health Care Cost Institute. Most run from a half hour to an hour.",
      "Insurers say annual visit limits help keep down costs, and therefore premiums, and are intended to prevent therapists from continuing treatment when patients are no longer improving. They say most injuries can be addressed in a dozen or fewer sessions and that people and employers who bought insurance could have purchased policies with better therapy benefits if it was a priority.",
      "Atul Patel, a physiatrist in Overland Park, Kansas, and the treasurer of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, said insurers' desire to prevent gratuitous therapy is understandable but has \"gone too far.\"",
      "\"Most patients get way less therapy than they would actually benefit from,\" he said.",
      "Hard caps on rehab endure in part because of an omission in the Affordable Care Act. While that law required insurers to cover rehab and barred them from setting spending restrictions on a patient's medical care, it did not prohibit establishing a maximum number of therapy sessions a year.",
      "More than 29,000 ACA health plans \u2014 nearly 4 in 5 \u2014 limit the annual number of physical therapy sessions, according to a KFF Health News analysis of plans sold last year to individuals and small businesses. Caps generally ranged from 20 to 60 visits; the most common was 20 a year.",
      "Health plans provided by employers often have limits of 20 or 30 sessions as well, said Cori Uccello, senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries.",
      "\"It's the gross reality in America right now,\" said Sam Porritt, chairman of the Falling Forward Foundation, a Kansas-based philanthropy that has paid for therapy for about 200 patients who exhausted their insurance over the past decade. \"No one knows about this except people in the industry. You find out about it when tragedy hits.\"",
      "Even in plans with no caps, patients are not guaranteed unlimited treatment. Therapists say insurers repeatedly require prior authorization, demanding a new request every two or three visits. Insurers frequently deny additional sessions if they believe there hasn't been improvement.",
      "\"We're seeing a lot of arbitrary denials just to see if you'll appeal,\" said Gwen Simons, a lawyer in Scarborough, Maine, who represents therapy practices. \"That's the point where the therapist throws up their hands.\"",
      "\"Couldn't pick her up\"",
      "Katie Kriegshauser, a 37-year-old psychologist from Kansas City, Missouri, developed pregnancy complications that shut down her liver, pancreas, and kidneys in November 2023. After giving birth to her daughter, she spent more than three months in a hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries and losing more than 40 pounds so quickly that doctors suspected her nerves became damaged from compression. Her neurologist told her he doubted she would ever walk again.",
      "Kriegshauser's UnitedHealthcare insurance plan allowed 30 visits at Ability KC, a rehabilitation clinic in Kansas City. She burned through them in six weeks in 2024 because she needed both physical therapy, to regain her mobility, and occupational therapy, for daily tasks such as getting dressed.",
      "\"At that point I was starting to use the walker from being completely in the wheelchair,\" Kriegshauser recalled. She said she wasn't strong enough to change her daughter's diaper. \"I couldn't pick her up out of her crib or put her down to sleep,\" she said.",
      "The Falling Forward Foundation paid for additional sessions that enabled her to walk independently and hold her daughter in her arms. \"A huge amount of progress happened in that period after my insurance ran out,\" she said.",
      "In an unsigned statement, UnitedHealthcare said it covered the services that were included in Kriegshauser's health plan. The company declined to permit an official to discuss its policies on the record because of security concerns.",
      "A shattered teenager",
      "Patients who need therapy near the start of a health plan's year are more likely to run out of visits. Mari Villar was 15 and had been walking with high school friends to get a bite to eat in May 2023 when a car leaped over a curb and smashed into her before the driver sped away.",
      "The accident broke both her legs, lacerated her liver, damaged her colon, severed an artery in her right leg, and collapsed her lung. She has undergone 11 operations, including emergency exploratory surgery to stop internal bleeding, four angioplasties, and the installation of screws and plates to hold her leg bones together.",
      "Villar spent nearly a month in Shirley Ryan AbilityLab's hospital in Chicago. She was discharged after her mother's insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, denied her physician's request for five more days, making her more reliant on outpatient therapy, according to records shared by her mother, Megan Bracamontes.",
      "Villar began going to one of Shirley Ryan's outpatient clinics, but by the end of 2023, she had used up the 30 physical therapy and 30 occupational therapy visits the Blue Cross plan allowed. Because the plan ran from July to June, she had no sessions left for the first half of 2024.",
      "\"I couldn't do much,\" Villar said. \"I made lots of progress there, but I was still on crutches.\"",
      "Dave Van de Walle, a Blue Cross spokesperson, said in an email that the insurer does not comment on individual cases. Razia Hashmi, vice president for clinical affairs at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in a written statement that patients who have run out of sessions should \"explore alternative treatment plans\" including home exercises.",
      "Villar received some extra sessions from the Falling Forward Foundation. While her plan year has reset, Villar is postponing most therapy sessions until after her next surgery so she will be less likely to run out again. Bracamontes said her daughter still can't feel or move her right foot and needs three more operations: one to relieve nerve pain, and two to try to restore mobility in her foot by lengthening her Achilles tendon and transferring a tendon in her left leg into her right.",
      "\"Therapy caps are very unfair because everyone's situation is different,\" Villar said. \"I really depend on my sessions to get me to a new normalcy. And not having that and going through all these procedures is scary to think about.\"",
      "Rationing therapy",
      "Most people who use all their sessions either stop going or pay out-of-pocket for extra therapy.",
      "Amy Paulo, a 34-year-old Massachusetts woman recovering from two operations on her left leg, maxed out the 40 visits covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in 2024, so she spent $1,445 out-of-pocket for 17 therapy sessions.",
      "Paulo needed physical therapy to recover from several surgeries to shorten her left leg to the length of her right leg \u2014 the difference a consequence of juvenile arthritis. Her recovery was prolonged, she said, because her femur didn't heal properly after one of the operations, in which surgeons cut out the middle of her femur and put a rod in its place.",
      "\"I went ballistic on Blue Cross many, many times,\" said Paulo, who works with developmentally delayed children.\"",
      "Amy McHugh, a Blue Cross spokesperson, declined to discuss Paulo's case. In an email, she said most employers who hire Blue Cross to administer their health benefits choose plans with \"our standard\" 60-visit limit, which she said is more generous than most insurers offer, but some employers \"choose to allow for more or fewer visits per year.\"",
      "Paulo said she expects to restrict her therapy sessions to once a week instead of the recommended twice a week because she'll need more help after an upcoming operation on her leg.",
      "\"We had to plan to save my visits for this surgery, as ridiculous as it sounds,\" she said.",
      "Medicare is more generous",
      "People with commercial insurance plans face more hurdles than those on Medicare, which sets dollar thresholds on therapy each year but allows therapists to continue providing services if they document medical necessity. This year the limits are $2,410 for physical and speech therapy and $2,410 for occupational therapy.",
      "Private Medicare Advantage plans don't have visit or dollar caps, but they often require prior authorization every few visits. The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found last year that MA plans deny requests for physical and occupational therapy at hospitals and nursing homes at higher rates than they reject other medical services.",
      "Therapists say many commercial plans require prior authorization and mete out approvals parsimoniously. Insurers often make therapists submit detailed notes, sometimes for each session, documenting patients' treatment plans, goals, and test results showing how well they perform each exercise.",
      "\"It's a battle of getting visits,\" said Jackee Ndwaru, an occupational therapist in Jacksonville, Florida. \"If you can't show progress they're not going to approve.\"",
      "An insurer overruled",
      "Marjorie Haney's insurance plan covered 20 therapy sessions a year, but Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield approved only a few visits at a time for the rotator cuff she tore in a bike accident in Maine. After 13 visits in 2021, Anthem refused to approve more, writing that her medical records \"do not show you made progress with specific daily tasks,\" according to the denial letter.",
      "Haney, a physical therapist herself, said the decision made no sense because at that stage of her recovery, the therapy was focused on preventing her shoulder from freezing up and gradually expanding its range of motion.",
      "\"I went through those visits like they were water,\" Haney, now 57, said. \"My range was getting better, but functionally I couldn't use my arm to lift things.\"",
      "Haney appealed to Maine's insurance bureau for an independent review. In its report overturning Anthem's decision, the bureau's physician consultant, William Barreto, concluded that Haney had made \"substantial improvement\" \u2014 she no longer needed a shoulder sling and was able to return to work with restrictions. Barreto also noted that nothing in Anthem's policy required progress with specific daily tasks, which was the basis for Anthem's refusal.",
      "\"Given the member's substantial restriction in active range of motion and inability to begin strengthening exercises, there is remaining deficit that requires the skills and training of a qualified physical therapist,\" the report said.",
      "Anthem said it requires repeated assessments before authorizing additional visits \"to ensure the member is receiving the right care for the right period of time based on his or her care needs.\" In the statement provided by Stephanie DuBois, an Anthem spokesperson, the insurer said this process \"also helps prevent members from using up all their covered treatment benefits too quickly, especially if they don't end up needing the maximum number of therapy visits.\"",
      "In 2023, Maine passed a law banning prior authorization for the first 12 rehab visits, making it one of the few states to curb insurer limitations on physical therapy. The law doesn't protect residents with plans based in other states or plans from a Maine employer who self-insures.",
      "Haney said after she won her appeal, she spaced out the sessions her plan permitted by going once weekly. \"I got another month,\" she said, \"and I stretched it out to six weeks.\"",

      "The three women from Revere, Massachusetts, 23-year-old Kaoutar Naqqad, 24-year-old Imane Mallah and 26-year-old Wafae El-Arar, were found unconscious in their hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in February. Investigators in Belize said last month that the women had a build-up of fluids in their lungs but were still awaiting final test results for the cause of death.",
      "Gian Cho, executive director of the National Forensics Science Service, said Wednesday that all three women had carboxyhemoglobin levels higher than 60%. Carboxyhemoglobin levels are typically lower than 2% in nonsmokers and lower than 5% in smokers.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas and is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned.\u00a0 Accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",

      "The screenshots show the timing and targets of the attack on Houthis in Yemen earlier this month were shared by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and discussed in the chat. The White House has stated \u2014 and Cabinet officials testified Tuesday \u2014 the information in the group chat wasn't classified, even though Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg received tactical details before the attack.",
      "At 11:44 a.m. ET on Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted in the chat, in all caps, according to screenshots provided by The Atlantic: \"TEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.\" The ensuing message included the timing of the expected strikes and what type of weapons would be used.",
      "\"This Signal message shows that the U.S. secretary of defense texted a group that included a phone number unknown to him\u2014Goldberg's cellphone\u2014at 11:44 a.m.,\" Goldberg and Shane Harris wrote in The Atlantic. \"This was 31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi 'Target Terrorist,' was expected to be killed by these American aircraft.\"",
      "\"If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests\u2014or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media\u2014the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds,\" Goldberg and Harris continued. \"The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.\"",
      "The White House has not denied the authenticity of the messages, but is sticking with its characterization of the information and continued to attack Goldberg.",
      "\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,'\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Wednesday morning. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.\"",
      "\"No locations,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz wrote on X Wednesday morning. \"No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE:\u00a0 President Trump is protecting America and our interests.\"",
      "He asserted that the sources of the intelligence were not discussed but did not address the timing or weapons packages used in the strikes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in group chat, posted on social media that Goldberg \"oversold what he had,\" and said the classified information that Goldberg claimed CIA director John Ratcliffe shared was \"the name of his chief of staff.\"",
      "Under questioning by Democrats at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Trump administration intelligence officials denied that the information in the chat was classified. Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who were both in the Houthi chat group, were asked by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",
      "The Atlantic said it asked Trump administration officials and the White House if they objected to publishing the messages in light of their denials that the messages contained classified information or \"war plans.\" Most did not respond, and Leavitt told The Atlantic the administration objected to the release, while insisting there was \"no classified information transmitted in the group chat.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive action to overhaul U.S. elections that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandate that all ballots be received by Election Day across the country.",
      "The order claims the U.S. has \"not adequately enforced Federal election requirements,\" citing as examples \"prohibit[ing] States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit[ing] non-citizens from registering to vote.\"",
      "The order says the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protections\" and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. The president also threatened to pull federal funding from states where election officials are not in compliance.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\" He said it \"seeks to seize authority over election technology and processes at the state and local level ... all while bypassing congressional approval.\"",
      "If implemented, it could cost state taxpayers tens of billions, he predicted, though Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, also expects the executive order to face a difficult road in the courts.",
      "While Congress has the power to regulate voting \u2014 and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act \u2014 the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" for elections.",
      "Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an \"unlawful\" weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is \"trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\" And Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, said the executive order \"is not just misguided \u2014 it is immoral and illegal.\"",
      "The executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies, like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, provide election support. The commission distributes grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.",
      "In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew\u00a0complaints from Republicans\u00a0who called it federal overreach. Mr. Trump rescinded that order.",
      "Mr. Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity. It states that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. The order also advises the commission to condition funding to states on these new guidelines.",
      "Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Mr. Trump for the executive order, calling it a \"great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.\"",
      "Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a \"welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.\"",
      "At least one Democratic attorney on Tuesday threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump's ire, said in a social media post, \"This will not stand. We will sue.\"",
      "The president has long claimed elections were being rigged, even before the results were known. He's battled certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, falsely blaming\u00a0widespread fraud for his loss.",

      "The S&P 500 dropped 64 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,712, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite nosed down 2% as investors pulled back from major technology players.",

But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Shares of automakers slid ahead of the announcement, with General Motors sinking 3.2% and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, dropping 3.5%. The Detroit automakers' manufacturing plants and supply chains are spread across North America, so additional tariffs would raise their costs and crimp profits.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% and are down 33% this year.",
      "Consumers are also likely to feel the sting of additional import duties. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated.",
      "Beyond the impact on the auto sector, investors have been rattled by President Trump's protectionist trade policies.

      "\"The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld by a federal appeals court on March 26. A White House spokesperson said it plans to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, who temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, has questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese decent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

      "The change is \"related to ongoing litigation,\" a White House administration official told CBS News. It is not clear which litigation challenging the dismantling of USAID caused DOGE to remove information about canceled contracts from its \"Wall of Receipts\" site. The official did not respond when asked for more information.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the 3,214 USAID contracts listed on DOGE's website contain no information other than the total contract value and the amount DOGE claims to have saved by canceling them. The canceled USAID contracts represent about 45% of the total number of itemized contracts on DOGE's website, and 57% of the $21.6 billion it claims to have saved from terminated contracts.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that DOGE likely violated the constitution when it acted to shutter USAID. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents DOGE from taking further action related to the shutdown of USAID.",
      "The USAID contracts alone total $12.4 billion in alleged savings, though multiple experts in federal contracting have said the method DOGE is using to calculate savings is flawed. DOGE uses the total potential value of a contract, which is often far higher than the actual amount an agency ends up spending, to estimate savings. The actual amount of funding cut as a result of USAID contract terminations is closer to $6.7 billion as of Tuesday, according to an analysis by former USAID data analyst Brian Banks.",
      "Multiple news outlets, including CBS News, have also identified errors in DOGE's accounting, with some contracts being double or triple counted. Many of the original errors have been removed but it's not clear if they are still included in the total $103 billion DOGE has claimed to have saved.",
      "DOGE, led by billionaire and President Trump's senior adviser Elon Musk, originally touted the list of canceled contracts as evidence of increased transparency.",
      "\"We're very public with what we do,\" Musk said in an interview with Ted Cruz on March 17. \"I don't know how we could be more transparent. Literally every action that we do, small or large, we post on the DOGE.gov website.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014 Six tourists died on Thursday when a tourist submarine sank off the resort of Hurghada on Egypt's Red Sea coast, the provincial governor said.",
      "The submarine was carrying 45 foreign tourists and five Egyptian crewmembers when it sank, Red Sea governor Maj. Gen. Amr Hanafi, said in a statement, adding that rescue teams were quickly sent.",
      "He said all six of the dead were Russians, and that 29 of the 39 tourists rescued were injured and taken to hospitals. No one was still missing from the vessel, he said. The Russian consulate in Hurghada said the tourists on the sunken vessel were Russian nationals, but Hanafi said the group also included citizens of India, Norway and Sweden.",
      "The governor's office posted video showing him visiting with some of the survivors at a hospital, including a child and her family.",
      "The state-owned Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper said investigations were underway to determine what caused the accident, the French news agency AFP reported.",
      "Hurghada, located about 285 miles southeast of the Egyptian capital Cairo, is a major destination for divers, snorkelers and other tourists drawn to the Red Sea's coral reefs.",
      "The submarine, named \"Sindbad,\" runs tours lasting about 40 minutes underwater, cruising at about 20-25 meters (65-80 feet) underwater with panoramic windows on the bottom to give views of the marine life, according to the website of the company that the Russian consulate identified as running the vessel.",

      "Tourism is an important sector of Egypt's economy but many tourist companies have stopped or limited traveling on the Red Sea due to the dangers from\u00a0conflicts in the region.",

    "summary": "No Senate confirmation hearing had been scheduled for U.N. ambassador nominee Elise Stefanik, a congresswoman from New York.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Elise Stefanik's nomination to be U.N. ambassador has been withdrawn, President Trump confirmed Thursday, with the president saying he's asked her to remain in Congress.",
      "The president's decision to pull her nomination ends two months of limbo for the New York Republican.",
      "\"As we advance our America First Agenda, it is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News reported her nomination was in jeopardy as GOP pressure mounted for her to back away from the position.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News there were ongoing discussions about whether she should withdraw from consideration. Stefanik had not resigned from her seat in Congress, and with the narrow majority in the House, Republicans need all the votes they can muster. House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.",
      "Republicans hold just 218 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 213 seats. There are currently four vacant seats. After the president's announcement, Johnson acknowledged the Republicans' slim majority on social media as he hailed Stefanik's \"selfless decision.\"",
      "\"It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise's agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies,\" Johnson said on social platform X, calling Stefanik \"a great leader and a devoted patriot.\"",
      "The speaker said he would invite Stefanik to return to the House Republicans' leadership team immediately.",
      "Democrats pounced on the withdrawal, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries noting Mr. Trump's margin of victory in Stefanik's district during November's presidential election.",
      "\"Donald Trump won the Elise Stefanik district by 21 points in November 2024. He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?\"",
      "In the Senate, there was little doubt Stefanik would have the votes to be confirmed. Her nomination was advanced by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 30.",
      "Republicans had discussed waiting to take further action on Stefanik's nomination to see how the Florida special elections go on April 1 for two vacant GOP seats. Both are expected to remain in Republican control.",
      "Stefanik did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Stefanik\u00a0has been among President Trump's most faithful allies and was the second nominee he announced for a Senate-confirmed position after the 2024 election. She was elected to Congress in 2014 and rose to House GOP leadership to be the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House.",

    "summary": "President Trump says the U.S. needs control of Greenland and the Panama Canal \"for national security.\" Here's why both places are so important.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump repeated vows to secure U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal in his speech to a joint a session of Congress\u00a0on March 4.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Greenland's prime minister responded, saying \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "Now, Vice President JD Vance and second lady\u00a0Usha Vance\u00a0are expected to visit Greenland this week, according to the White House. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz will also join the trip, sources familiar with the planning told CBS News, amid fallout from leaked messages about an attack on the Houthis in Yemen.\u00a0Donald Trump Jr. visited in January\u00a0before the president took office.",
      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada. The largest island in the world, it is about 836,000 square miles, around the size of Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to only around 60,000 people. It is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark and has its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Inside the Vances' Greenland visit",
      "Usha Vance was originally supposed to visit Greenland solo as part of an expanded cultural trip, but on Tuesday, March 25, the vice president announced he would join her. On Thursday, sources familiar with the planning told CBS News that Waltz would join the couple. The Vances have previously said they will leave for Greenland on Friday. One source told CBS News that Waltz will also leave Friday.",
      "The Vances are expected to travel to the country on Friday and spend time at Pituffik Space Base, the United States' northernmost military installation. The base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is locked in by ice for much of the year, according to its website, but operates its airfield year-round.",
      "The Vances are expected to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with service members at the base. It's not clear if Waltz will participate in the same activities.",
      "While announcing his visit, Vance didn't mention Mr. Trump's hopes to acquire Greenland but said that the \"really important\" nation has been threatened by other countries.",
      "\"A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there,\" Vance said in a video announcing his visit.",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he added. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "A\u00a0recent poll showed\u00a0that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

      "A World War II airman who was taken captive by Japanese forces and died in a prison fire after his plane was shot down has been accounted for, military officials said Wednesday.",
      "U.S. Army Air Forces Cpl. Glenn H. Hodak, 23, was a member of the 93rd Bombardment Squadron in the 19th Bombardment group in March 1945, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Hodak, of Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, was a gunner aboard a B-29 \"Superfortress\" aircraft. These planes had multiple machine guns, held over 20,000 pounds of bombs and were especially suited to fly to Japan from bases in China during World War II, according to the National Museum of the United States Air Force.",
      "Hodak's plane was shot down while on a mission to Tokyo. He was initially reported as missing in action, the DPAA said, but investigators learned he had been captured after the plane was taken down. He was taken to the Tokyo Military Prison.",
      "In late May 1945, U.S. aircraft heavily bombed Tokyo, causing huge fires and burning hundreds of structures, according to Military.com. One of the destroyed buildings was the Tokyo Military Prison. Hodak was among the service members being held there at the time. None of the people imprisoned at the facility survived the blaze, Military.com reported. They were buried in a mass grave.",
      "The American Graves Registration Service disinterred 65 sets of remains from the prison in early 1946, after World War II ended. The service was able to identify 25 sets of remains. One was a Japanese person, the DPAA said. The 39 unidentified sets of remains were interred as Unknowns at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",
      "In 2022, the sets of remains were disinterred again and sent to the DPAA laboratory for analysis. In 2024, the DPAA launched the Tokyo Prison Fire Project. In a social media post, the agency said the project \"faces considerable forensic challenges due to the burned and fragmentary condition of the remains and extreme commingling.\"",
      "To identify Hodak's remains, DPAA scientists used dental and anthropological analysis, as well as circumstantial evidence, the agency said. DNA sequencing has also been used to identify service members who died at the prison, the DPAA said on social media.",
      "\"The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has had recent success accounting for Americans from the Tokyo Prison Fire. We have accounted for two service members thus far for this project,\" the agency told CBS News.",

Officials in Japan have heard these comments from Mr. Trump before, and so far, they've continued shaping the country's national security plans based on the assurance of backing from the United States.",
      "Government officials admit they really have no other choice.",
      "\"There is no Plan B for Japan other than the U.S.,\" Takuya Akiyama, Principal Deputy Director of the North American Affairs Bureau at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CBS News. \"Treaty wise and also as a physical presence, no other country can substitute the U.S. It is unthinkable.\"",
      "The U.S. may be pulling back from Europe under President Trump, but despite his remarks about Japan, U.S. military cooperation with Tokyo has appeared stable, and may even expand as the White House ramps up its standoff with Asia's increasingly assertive superpower, China.",
      "China's threat to its neighbors",
      "Japanese officials may have breathed a sigh of relief after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to the White House in February. The Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment to Japan's defense, including amid Tokyo's dispute with Beijing over ownership of the Senkaku islands.",
      "It is one of many land ownership disputes between China and its neighbors over islands in the South China Sea \u2014 virtually all of which Beijing claims as its territory. The White House has repeatedly condemned Chinese aggression and militarization in the South China Sea, and U.S. warships and aircraft routinely carry out \"freedom of navigation\" exercises in the area \u2014 often drawing sharp rebukes from Beijing.",
      "Advisers to the Japanese prime minister spent the months after the U.S. election preparing him for the meeting with Mr. Trump. They focused on using clear and concise language to convey the benefits of the security alliance to the U.S., and the increase Japan has made in its own defense spending and military procurement from America, according to officials at the Japanese foreign ministry.",
      "China has been rapidly bolstering its military capabilities, including its nuclear program, in recent years, according to U.S. officials. Last year, China announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget, which was already the world's second-highest, behind only the United States.",
      "In February, Taiwan condemned China and deployed its own forces in response as the Chinese military held \"shooting training\" drills in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "\"From an American perspective, it's clear that if Taiwan falls, and if Japan falls, that our alliances in the Indo-Pacific are over,\" Kenneth Weinstein, Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute think tank, told CBS News. \"China will exercise extraordinary military sway \u2014 will be able to close down global shipping such as they see it, will be able to throttle access to the South China Sea and elsewhere.\"",
      "There have already been tense encounters between Japanese and Chinese naval vessels around the Senkaku islands, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo. According to data from Japan's coast guard, Chinese government vessels entered the maritime zone around the islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, on 355 of the 366 days of 2024 \u2014 the highest number of intrusions reported by Japan since China started operating around the islands in 2008.",
      "The Chinese vessels operating around the islands have increased not only in number, but in armament, carrying more and larger weapons as they circle the disputed territories, according to officials at the foreign and defense ministries.",
      "While Japanese analysts don't believe a Chinese military invasion of the Senkaku islands is imminent, they say there's a risk that an accident or incident involving fishing or other non-military vessels in the area could lead to a rapid military escalation.",
      "\"The Chinese Communist Party believes in power. They have started to act because they believe they now have the power to do so,\" China expert Akio Takahara, a professor at the Tokyo Woman's Christian University, told CBS News. \"We want the U.S. to increase their presence in this region, because the Chinese are certainly going to enhance their presence in the region.\"",
      "Major boost to U.S.-Japan defense cooperation coming?",
      "Japan has revamped its approach to defense in recent years, including by committing to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by 2027. Japan announced a major policy shift in 2022, abandoning the country's post-World War II, exclusively defense posture with a decision to acquire counterstrike capabilities.",
      "The Trump administration has seemingly approved of the changes, and it has not asked Japan for even greater increases in defense spending as some Japanese officials feared it might.",
      "While Mr. Trump complained specifically this month about Japan's hypothetical preparedness to meet its mutual defense obligation to the U.S. under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Japanese officials have tried to focus more on Article 6, under which Japan provides bases and facilities for U.S. forces. And that aspect of the relationship could be set to expand.",
      "The U.S. and Japan have been in discussions since before Mr. Trump came back to the White House about the possible establishment of a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan. If it happens, it would upgrade the role of the U.S. forces in Japan to a command headquarters with operational authority. The dialogue over the upgrade was announced under the Biden administration, after being requested by the Japanese.",
      "In the event of a regional security crisis \u2014 such as a Chinese attack on Taiwan or a disputed South China Sea island \u2014 having a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan would give the U.S. military the capacity to respond with commands from the region, rather than waiting for orders to come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to meet with his Japanese counterpart in late March to discuss efforts to bolster U.S. forces in the Pacific region.",
      "Concern over Ukraine",
      "The dramatic vacillations by the Trump administration in its stance on Ukraine have also raised concern in Japan. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Japan has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Japanese officials worry about the precedent that would be set if the U.S. is seen to abandon a partner nation in the face of an invasion by a more powerful neighbor.",
      "\"In light of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, countries' perceptions on security have drastically changed around the world,\" then-Japanese Prime minister Fumio Kishida said at a regional security summit In June 2022, several months into Russia's invasion. \"I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.\"",
      "The Japanese fear that if the U.S. and the world at large are prepared to accept a change in Europe's borders forced by Russian aggression, they could also decline to intervene in the case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "\"The Chinese will be encouraged that, perhaps if Xi Jinping did something similar, Trump will be as kind to Xi Jinping as he's been to Putin,\" professor Takahara told CBS News. \"That kind of message will be received in Beijing.\"",
      "Officials in Tokyo are trying to remain focused on the long-term bilateral relationship with Washington, looking beyond the Trump administration, but they know China is watching closely as the relationship develops, especially given the volatile nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "\"We don't know what Mr. Trump will be saying tomorrow and doing the day after. So, at least the Ishiba visit, the first round, went okay. We were happy about that,\" Takahara said. \"But what about the next round? When is it coming? No one knows.\"",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026.\u00a0The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities in Belize said Wednesday that three American women who were found dead last month while\u00a0on vacation in the country died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "The three women from Revere, Massachusetts, 23-year-old Kaoutar Naqqad, 24-year-old Imane Mallah and 26-year-old Wafae El-Arar, were found unconscious in their hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in February. Investigators in Belize said last month that the women had a build-up of fluids in their lungs but were still awaiting final test results for the cause of death.",
      "Gian Cho, executive director of the National Forensics Science Service, said Wednesday that all three women had carboxyhemoglobin levels higher than 60%. Carboxyhemoglobin levels are typically lower than 2% in nonsmokers and lower than 5% in smokers.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas and is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned.\u00a0 Accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams said that as a result of the findings, authorities have conducted a second test of the hotel room for carbon monoxide poisoning after initial testing showed no signs. Williams said they are still awaiting the final test results.",
      "Authorities also found and tested the alcohol and gummies found in the room. THC was found in one of the items, but no illicit substances were found in the bodies of the three women, Cho said.",
      "The families of the deceased said in a joint statement, \"While we remain shattered by the loss of these three bright lights in our world, we are incredibly heartened by the results of this investigation and grateful to those who completed it in a thorough and independent manner.\"",
      "\"We have said since the beginning of this investigation that their deaths were suspicious and raised concerns about initial reports in the news media. While today's official finding puts to rest those initial reports, we hope this will give authorities in law enforcement pause before they make similar suggestions during future investigations,\" the families said, noting they were still awaiting results of an independent review being conducted by Massachusettes authorities. \"Survivors such as our families deserve their best, honest work. We received it today but needed it throughout this investigative process.\"",
      "\"Our families remain incredibly grateful to the outpouring of support we have received from family, friends, leaders and loved ones since their passing. We appreciate the privacy that has been extended to our families as we grieve and are also grateful to the media who have helped ensure that Wafae, Imane, Kaoutar and the impact of their loss are a central part of your news coverage,\" they added. \"Our families ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this unimaginable loss. May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace. We will forever love and miss you, Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.",

    "story": [
      "The editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, has nothing to say about his relationship with national security adviser Mike Waltz, who inadvertently added him to a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Yemen days ago.",
      "\"I'm just not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz,\" Goldberg told CBS News in an interview Wednesday.",
      "Waltz claimed he has \"never met\" with Goldberg, wouldn't be able to pick him out of a police lineup and trashed his reputation, calling him \"the bottom scum of journalists.\" But photos surfaced online earlier Wednesday of the two together at an event at the French Embassy in 2021.",
      "\"If your eyeballs see us together, then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together,\" Goldberg said of the photos.",
      "Waltz has also suggested that Goldberg somehow added himself to the Signal chat that also included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 or that some other technical mishap that led to the breach. Goldberg called the claims \"crazy.\"",
      "\"This is what happened on March 11,\" Goldberg continued. \"I got a message request from Michael Waltz. I accepted the message request. That's what happened.\" Signal only allows users to add people to chat groups by phone number, QR code or username of the person they wish to add. The Atlantic story published Wednesday included a screenshot that showed Waltz as administrator and \"JG\" as a member of the group chat, named the \"Houthi PC small group.\"",
      "\"If I'm such a nefarious character,\" Goldberg said, \"why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information about the way an administration is contemplating military action? What do they really think is going to happen?\"",
      "Goldberg did not publish the contents of the message thread until more than a week after the Yemen strikes. On Monday, he posted a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat and characterized parts of the conversation about plans to bomb Houthi targets, rather than quoting them directly, citing his concerns that the details were too sensitive to publish. But after the group chat members and President Trump repeatedly denied that the information was classified, Goldberg, after checking with the administration to see if officials wanted anything redacted, published the text messages about the strikes on Wednesday.",
      "The additional messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Goldberg said it's in the public's interest to have the information and be able to judge the incident for themselves.",
      "\"The public has a right to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. There's obvious proof here that national security officials we're talking about real-time intelligence and military information on an open source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing,\" Goldberg said. \"When reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump Cabinet members sent texts on Signal, one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia, but the White House says he didn't have his phone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after\u00a0more text messages came to light\u00a0and revealed new details about what was shared.",
      "The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk.",
      "\"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,\" Himes said.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "\"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that \"war plans\" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.",
      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",

      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",

      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration continues to insist it didn't defy a federal judge's order when it failed to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order blocking the deportations of alleged gang members who hadn't been afforded due process. It's a case that's become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and federal courts.",
      "In a 14-page document\u00a0filed late Tuesday night, the Justice Department spelled out before Boasberg why it didn't turn around the two flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members despite his verbal order to do so.",
      "\"These removals both complied with the law and safeguarded Americans against members of a foreign terrorist organization. The Government will continue to defend the removals before this Court and, if necessary, on appeal challenging this Court's two injunctions issued on March 15,\" the filing reads. It's signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior DOJ officials.",
      "The government attempts to thread the needle regarding Boasberg's directive, arguing that it didn't \"remove\" any of the migrants after he entered his order and that it \"complied with the Court's injunction with respect to the two flights at issue\" because it didn't formally remove anyone after 7:25 p.m. Saturday, though acknowledging it \"did not order any removal flights to return to the United States.\"",
      "Boasberg asked Drew Ensign, the attorney for the Justice Department, if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did. But in its appellate court filing, the DOJ continued to argue that Boasberg's order was unclear and insufficient to be binding, asserting it \"failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a binding injunction\" because Boasberg and the court didn't state \"the reasons why it issued\" the injunction.",
      "\"It is well-settled (in law) that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" the filing alleges.",
      "The DOJ later in the filing argues that once the flights were out of U.S. airspace, they were \"military matters\" and President Trump has the power to order military flights wherever he wants.",
      "\"DOJ cites state secrets privilege\"",
      "On Monday, the administration invoked a state secrets privilege\u00a0and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has\u00a0asked for details\u00a0about when the planes landed and who was on board, information the administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift\u00a0Boasberg's order\u00a0and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the three-judge panel.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said, \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" referring to the way Nazis detained in the U.S.\u00a0during World World II were processed compared to the Venezuelan immigrants deported\u00a0to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" government attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison didn't have the chance to appear in court.",
      "Millett is one of the three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II. The law has only been invoked three times throughout American history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's assertions that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She's the one who didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, also an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\"\u00a0the judge wrote.",

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify about global threats facing the U.S. However the annual hearing, which typically focuses on threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, largely concentrated on the lapse.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",
      "Group chat controversy",
      "On Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans, although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later denied any war plans were discussed. Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The National Security Council said Monday in a statement to CBS News that the message thread \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now\": Democrats grill on group chat",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe both denied that classified information was shared in the group chat in a feisty exchange with Warner. Confronted by Warner, Gabbard initially declined to say whether she was part of the chat.",
      "\"Because it's all classified?\" Warner said.",
      "\"Because this is currently under review,\" Gabbard responded.",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now,\" Warner said.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year.",
      "\"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year. \"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "\"It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels,\" Ratcliffe said. \"My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "Ratcliffe later told Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommended that \"high-level officials who would be targeted by foreign adversaries\" use \"end-to-end encrypted apps whenever possible.\"",
      "The spy chiefs also denied that the conversation included information on weapons packages, targets or timing of the strikes, as Goldberg reported.",
      "\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Ratcliffe said, with Gabbard adding \"same answer.\"",
      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia noted that, according to the messages shared by Goldberg, the timing of the strikes were debated by Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth.",
      "\"They were discussing the timing of sending U.S. air crews into enemy airspace, where they faced an air defense threat, correct?\" Ossoff asked, repeating the question when Ratcliffe didn't directly answer. \"They're talking about the timing of U.S. airstrikes, correct?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "During questioning from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard also denied participating in any Signal group chats in which classified information was shared.",
      "Gabbard told Wyden she had \"no objection\" to cooperating with an audit to confirm such, while Ratcliffe said he would comply with any follow up that the National Security Council deemed appropriate.",
      "Another heated moment came during the back and forth between Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, and Ratcliffe. Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "\"It's an embarrassment,\" Bennet said. \"You need to do better.\"",

A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 22:36:38 -0400",
    "summary": "South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, but didn't rule on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's Constitutional Court on Monday overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader, while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "Many observers said Monday's ruling doesn't signal much on the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn't a key figure in Yoon's martial law imposition. But it could still embolden Yoon's staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Han became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly over his Dec. 3 imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis. But Han was impeached by the assembly as well in late December following political strife with opposition lawmakers.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country's top two officials intensified a domestic division and deepened worries about the country's diplomatic and economic activities. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, had since serving as acting president.",
      "On Monday, seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment. They ruled the accusations against him weren't against the law or weren't serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.",
      "Dismissing Han would have needed the support of at least six court justices.",
      "Following his reinstatement, Han told reporters he would focus on the \"most urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies. He also called for a national unity, saying \"there's no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\"",
      "The court has yet to rule on Yoon's impeachment. If the court upholds Yoon's impeachment, South Korea must hold a election for a new president. If it rules for him, Yoon will be restored to office and regain his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon was impeached about two weeks earlier than Han. Observers earlier predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon's case in mid-March but it hasn't done so.",
      "Yoon has been separately arrested and charged with rebellion in connection with his martial law decree. If convicted of that charge, he would face the death penalty or a life sentence. On March 8, Yoon was released from prison, after a Seoul district court allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing Yoon or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon's martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "At the center of squabbling over Yoon is why he sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after declaring martial law. Yoon says he aims to maintain order, but senior military and police officers sent there have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted it down unanimously.",
      "Han, a career diplomat who was appointed by Yoon, had attempted to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets, when he served as acting president. A major trigger for the opposition's push for his impeachment was Han's refusal to fill three vacancies on the nine-member Constitutional Court bench.",
      "Restoring the court's full membership was sensitive because a ruling upholding Yoon's impeachment requires support from at least six justices.",
      "Han's successor, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Both Han and Choi cited needing bipartisan consent to add justices to the court, but their critics suspected they were siding with Yoon's People Power Party, which wanted to increase Yoon's chances of returning to power. On Friday, the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion on Choi.",

      "After a yearlong search, the Sundance Film Festival announced Thursday that its new home will be Boulder, Colorado, keeping Sundance in the mountains but moving it out of Park City, the Utah ski town that had for decades provided the premier independent film gathering its picturesque snowy backdrop.",
      "Organizers said that after 40 years in the mountains, the festival had outgrown Park City, and lacked the necessary theaters or affordable housing to continue hosting what has become one of North America\u2019s most sprawling movie events. Sundance had narrowed down the options to Salt Lake City (with a smaller presence in Park City), Cincinnati and Boulder.",
      "'IMPORTANT LESSON': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST REVEALS 'FASCINATING' EXPERIENCE AT LIBERAL SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL",
      "Boulder emerged as their choice due to its close proximity to nature, its small-town charm and an engaged community that, organizer said, provides Sundance the ideal setting for its future.",
      "\"Boulder is a tech town, it\u2019s a college town, it\u2019s an arts town, and it\u2019s a mountain town,\" Amanda Kelso, acting chief executive of the Sundance Institute, said in an interview Thursday from Boulder. \"At 100,000 people, a larger town than Park City, it gives us the space to expand.\"",
      "Kelso, Sundance Institute board chair Ebs Burnough and Eugene Hernandez, director of the festival and head of programming, spoke shortly before announcing the festival\u2019s move in Boulder. Local officials, who helped lure Sundance with $34 million in tax credits over 10 years, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator and important contributor to our thriving culture,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (Dem.) said in a statement.",
      "Reacting to the decision, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (Rep.) said Thursday that Sundance will come to regret leaving Utah.",
      "\"As I\u2019ve said from the beginning, we wanted Sundance to stay,\" Cox said in a statement. \"We made that clear to their leadership and put together a highly competitive package. Ultimately, this decision is theirs to make, but I believe it\u2019s a mistake and that, one day, they\u2019ll realize they left behind not just a place, but their heritage.\"",
      "The marquee of the Egyptian Theatre appears during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah on Jan. 28, 2020.\u00a0 (Arthur Mola/Invision/AP)",
      "A changed endorsed by Sundance founder Robert Redford",
      "A shift from Park City to Boulder means Sundance stays at altitude but gives up being located in an expensive ski town. The mile-high Colorado city set in the foothills of the Rockies also maintains a sense of surrounding nature \u2014 something organizers stressed as a factor in their decision. Boulder\u2019s four-block pedestrian mall on Pearl Street, with nearby theaters, could also provide a similar sense of central hub like Park City\u2019s Main Street. The Macky Auditorium, on the University of Colorado campus, is expected to be a central stage for Sundance.",
      "The Sundance Institute was founded in 1981 by Robert Redford, who sought a location far from Hollywood to foster independent voices in film. In 1984, the institute took over the Sundance Film Festival, but the nonprofit\u2019s mission of helping young filmmakers grow through labs and workshops \u2014 Redford\u2019s real passion \u2014 continued year-round away from the festival.",
      "The 88-year-old Redford, who attended the University of Colorado in Boulder in his youth, gave the move his blessing.",
      "\"Words cannot express the sincere gratitude I have for Park City, the state of Utah, and all those in the Utah community that have helped to build the organization,\" Redford said in a statement. \"What we\u2019ve created is remarkably special and defining. As change is inevitable, we must always evolve and grow, which has been at the core of our survival.\"",
      "How Sundance chose its new home",
      "The festival made \"ethos and equity values\" one of its criteria, prompting many to wonder how much local politics would influence the choice by Sundance, which emphasizes inclusivity. Gov. Cox is currently weighing a bill that would ban the flying of certain flags at schools and government buildings, including the LGBTQ pride flag.",
      "Organizers said Boulder\u2019s \"welcoming environment aligns with the ethos the Sundance Film Festival developed in Park City.\"",
      "\"This process started 18 months ago and we\u2019ve been in Utah for 40 years. So politics really didn\u2019t guide the process,\" Burnough said Thursday. \"It was really and truly about evolution. That\u2019s where it landed. We didn\u2019t constantly spend time examining what bill was going forward or may or may not be signed.\"",
      "With its current contract expiration date looming, the hunt for a new host city began in earnest in April 2024. The initial group of six contenders also included Atlanta, Louisville, Kentucky and Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "What Sundance has meant for Park City, and the film world",
      "Before packing up, Sundance will have one last edition in Park City in January 2026.",
      "\"The Sundance Film Festival will be the Sundance Film Festival wherever we go. What\u2019s consistent is our mission,\" said Hernandez. \"This is a festival of global discovery. What\u2019s exciting about Boulder is this is a place we can build.\"",
      "Over the years, Sundance in Park City swelled into a premier marketplace for American film, drawing studio executives and parka-wearing celebrities into the Wasatch mountains every January. It helped launch countless filmmakers over the years, from Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies and Videotape\") to Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\").

      "The researchers also found\u00a0DNA changes related to immune system pathways in the placentas that were exposed to acetaminophen, which was linked to a higher chance of children developing ADHD.",

      "A nationwide study in Taiwan, however, found that the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy increased the development of ADHD in offspring, regardless of whether the mothers had mental health disorders.",
      "Many prior studies have relied on mothers\u2019 self-reporting \u2013 which underestimates use, as many people take acetaminophen without knowing it, according to Baker.",
      "Study limitations",

      "Another major limitation is the study design, as it cannot prove that acetaminophen use causes ADHD.",
      "\"We can never be 100% sure that an association is causal in an observational study like this, as there can always be unknown confounding factors,\" Baker told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD is a \"complex, multifactorial deficit in executive functioning\" that can manifest in a variety of ways, according to one expert. (iStock)",
      "\"We tried to control for as many factors as possible, including family history of mental health conditions, maternal use of antibiotics, maternal use of other drugs used for pain/fever, socioeconomic status of the family, and prenatal tobacco and alcohol exposure,\" he added.",
      "While the researchers may have identified a\u00a0possible risk for ADHD, the mental health condition is a \"complex, multifactorial deficit in executive functioning\" that can manifest in a variety of ways, according to Dr. Lama Bazzi, a psychiatrist in private practice in New York City.",
      "\"We can never be 100% sure that an association is causal in an observational study like this.\"",
      "There are approximately\u00a0six million pregnancies every year and 80% of women take at least one medication for a health problem diagnosed before or during pregnancy, according to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.",
      "The majority of women take acetaminophen at some point during pregnancy, with more use among those with\u00a0anxiety and depression, according to past research.",
      "\"We have evaluated the latest science and have not seen any evidence that we believe validates a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues,\" a spokesperson for Kenvue, the company that makes Tylenol, told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",

      "\"BMI is a measure of body size, but does not provide information on fat distribution, whereas waist circumference is a proxy more closely related to abdominal adiposity,\" they wrote.",
      "\"This distinction is crucial because visceral fat, which accumulates around the abdominal organs, is more metabolically active and has been implicated in adverse health outcomes, including insulin resistance, inflammation and abnormal blood fat levels. Consequently, individuals with similar BMIs may have distinct cancer risks due to differences in fat distribution.\"",
      "Why the difference between men and women?",
      "One potential reason for the gender discrepancy, according to the researchers, is that men are more likely to store fat viscerally (in the belly), while women generally accumulate more subcutaneous fat (under the skin) and peripheral fat (in the arms and legs).",
      "ALZHEIMER\u2019S AND PARKINSON\u2019S RISK IS HIGHER FOR PEOPLE WITH BODY FAT IN TWO SPECIFIC AREAS",

      "Strength training three times per week is ideal, one doctor advised. \"Resistance training reduces visceral fat and inflammation.\" (iStock)",
      "Osborn reiterated that BMI is limited in its ability to accurately measure excess fat.",

      "Minimizing risk",
      "To reduce cancer risk, Osborn recommends that men measure their waistlines to ensure they're in a healthy range. People can also track their visceral fat score on a medical-grade anthropometry scale, he said.",
      "\"Understand that belly fat isn\u2019t just cosmetic \u2014 it\u2019s carcinogenic.\"",

      "The majority of these side effects do not cause symptoms and resolve without treatment, but in rare cases ARIA can cause serious medical issues or can even be fatal.",
      "This most recent study showed that 30% of participants experienced ARIA, likely due to the higher doses of the drug.",

      "But that source also said they \"don't think it's fair\" to fully blame Stefanik, arguing that it was a failure of Republican Party leaders in general for letting the divisions \"fester.\"",
      "\"Nature abhors a vacuum. And you have 15 different county chairs, basically like three different regions of the state, pushing their own person. It's a really messy, ugly process,\" the source said. \"When you have a party leader making a decision versus a primary where you can run a race \u2014 it's the kind of thing you have to wrap up quickly.\"",
      "That person also pointed out Stefanik was \"one of the first ones ready to go\" as an early favorite for the Trump administration, and questioned whether she would be having the same issues had she resigned from Congress on Jan. 20 instead of being a \"loyalist\" to the GOP and staying for her vote.",

Initially seen in targeted attacks, it has now gone mainstream, affecting industries like hospitality and healthcare.",

First, you are told to press Windows + R, which opens the Windows Run dialog. Then you are instructed to press CTRL + V, which pastes a malicious script copied from the website\u2019s virtual clipboard.

      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag.

      "Hackers worldwide are exploiting any type of free document converter or downloader tool to carry out this scheme. The scam may involve websites that promise to convert files, such as turning a .doc into a .pdf, or tools that claim to merge multiple images into a single document.

      "3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware.",
      "4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it.",
      "5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware.",
      "6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files.",
      "7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware.",
      "8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection.",
      "9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The convenience of free online tools often blinds us to the risks they carry. Many users assume that if a website looks professional or ranks high on Google, it must be safe. Cybercriminals understand this mindset and take full advantage of it.",
      "The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.",

      "6) Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication:\u00a0Creating unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts and devices is essential. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

The iOS 18.2 update, released in December, patched the vulnerability by enforcing HTTPS for all network communications within the Passwords app, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or redirect traffic.",
      "If you\u2019re using an iPhone or iPad with the Passwords app, ensure your device is updated to iOS 18.2 or later. This ensures you\u2019re protected from this vulnerability. If you haven\u2019t updated yet and used the app on public Wi-Fi between September and December 2024, consider changing passwords for any accounts you accessed during that period, just to be safe.",

      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6) Regularly monitor all your accounts:\u00a0Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and report any unusual transactions or login attempts to Apple.",
      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

      "Most of us have at least one young woman in our lives that we cherish \u2014 a daughter, niece or goddaughter, for example. Well, this International Women\u2019s Day, I learned something that should be concerning to us all. Fully\u00a096% of all deepfakes \u2014 artificial intelligence-generated images and videos that use someone\u2019s likeness \u2014 are pornographic and target women without their consent.",
      "One well-known case involved an Australian law student who discovered that manipulated pornographic images of her were being shared online when she was just 18. But this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. According to a\u00a0recent survey of women in the U.S., AI deepfakes are among the types of online abuse that a significant number of women face despite being a relatively new technology.",
      "But this isn\u2019t the only type of online abuse women face.",
      "According to the same survey, one in four women in the U.S. say they\u2019ve experienced online abuse, including cyberbullying, doxxing, sexual harassment, trolling and AI deepfakes. And young women between the ages of 18 and 34 appear to experience much higher rates of online abuse than older generations.",

      "A woman with her daughter working on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why are younger women at higher risk?",
      "It probably has a lot to do with how much time younger people spend online.\u00a0Research shows, to no one\u2019s surprise, that younger generations use social media twice as much as older generations (80% versus 42%, respectively). However, it also indicates that women use it more than men.",
      "Data privacy also plays a role. A recent study showed younger generations are generally less concerned about keeping their personal information private compared to older generations. Growing up in a digital-first world, many younger people appear to be desensitized to data collection and are more willing to share personal information online. That, in turn, puts them at higher risk of cybercrimes and abuse.",

      "On Oct. 7, 2023, Evyatar was at the Nova music festival with three other friends when Hamas\u2019 attacks began. Two of Evyatar\u2019s friends did not survive the attacks, while he and his best friend, Guy Gilboa-Dalal, were taken hostage.",

In the video, the two men in their 20s appear frail and tired as they beg for their lives while being forced to watch a hostage release ceremony in Gaza.",
      "\"When it was finished, I could breathe,\" Ilay told Fox News Digital as he recalled watching the film for the first time. \"I saw them alive. I saw that they are together.\"",

He told Fox News Digital that the former hostages said the two men have been underground in the tunnels for most of their captivity and were only able to see sunlight when they were taken to the ceremony. As is the case with most hostages, Evyatar and Guy are given very little to eat and have limited access to water.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attempts to set the record straight on the Atlantic article.",
      "European leaders were notably silent on Tuesday following the text exchange between Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance, who noted their \"loathing\" of their long-standing allies.",
      "\"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,\" Hegseth said in response to Vance, who questioned U.S. leadership in advancing security policies in the Red Sea to counter Houthi aggression and reopen shipping lanes.",

      "\"There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this,\" he added in reference to the route that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, and which is vital in connecting shipping from Europe, the Middle East and Asia. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.\"",

      "The lack of public retort could suggest Europe is biting its tongue while it evaluates how to maintain a relationship with an administration that routinely argues against the value of its long-standing European allies.",

      "\"So I think a lot of Europeans, while not liking the way this conversation has unfolded\u2026can't actually dispute the substance, even if we don't like the methodology for this conversation,\" he added. \"And therefore, it is probably better to say little about it than to risk this sort of bigger argument about burden sharing, once again, coming to the fore.\"",
      "In the Signal text exchange, the administration officials said that \"further economic gain\" would need to be \"extracted in return\" for the U.S. taking the operational lead \u2013 which some British lawmakers took issue with, noting the Trump administration\u2019s renewed attempt to \"extort\" money from its allies.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces says it recently concluded the encirclement of Tel al-Sultan in Gaza. (IDF Video)",
      "Israel\u2019s war in Gaza resumed in full force last week after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire and a deadlock in negotiations over the release of the remaining hostages. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a new wave of airstrikes, quickly followed by coordinated ground operations in three key areas: the Netzarim Corridor, Gaza\u2019s northern coastline and the Rafah district in the south.",
      "With expanded U.S. support and favorable shifts in the regional landscape, this next phase signals a significant evolution in Israel\u2019s military objectives, from degrading Hamas\u2019s battlefield capabilities to dismantling its ability to govern.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been fighting them for 10 days,\" said Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror (res.), former Israeli national security advisor. \"All they\u2019ve managed to do is fire seven rockets. That tells you how much damage we\u2019ve inflicted already.\"",

      "This time, Israel is operating under dramatically improved conditions, both militarily and diplomatically.",
      "\"The strategic environment has changed,\" Amidror told Fox News Digital. \"Hezbollah is weaker, Iran is constrained, and the American administration is offering us true support. They\u2019re not telling us where to bomb or how to fight.\"",
      "With fewer threats on other fronts and strong backing from the Trump administration, the IDF has broadened its scope to include Hamas\u2019s political leadership.",
      "\"We\u2019re not just degrading military capabilities anymore,\" Amidror said. \"We\u2019re dismantling the structure that allowed Hamas to govern.\"",

He noted that Gaza currently has sufficient food reserves and that Israel is developing new delivery mechanisms that bypass Hamas entirely.",
      "Fifty-nine Israeli hostages remain in Hamas captivity. Their continued detention has sparked nationwide protests, with families urging the government to prioritize a negotiated release. But the renewed fighting puts those hostages in greater danger.",

If they don\u2019t, that alone is a reason to go back to war. And even if Hamas does return them, we\u2019ll be watching. If Hamas starts smuggling weapons again or training fighters, that, too, will be a reason to go in and hit them hard.\"",

      "While that sounds like the case of The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief being added to a group Signal chat by Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Waltz, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed military attack plans in Yemen, it\u2019s not.",
      "It\u2019s what happened to a longtime Department of Homeland Security employee who\u00a0told colleagues she inadvertently sent unclassified details of an upcoming Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation to a journalist in late January, according to former\u00a0ICE chief of staff Jason Houser, one former DHS official and one current DHS official. (The two officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they do not want to endanger their current or future career opportunities.)",
      "But unlike Waltz and Hegseth, who both remain in their jobs, the career DHS employee was put on administrative leave and told late last week that the agency intends to revoke her security clearance, the officials said.",
      "The Trump administration, meanwhile, has largely rallied around Waltz and Hegseth, with Trump on Wednesday calling it \u201call a witch hunt.\u201d",
      "The episode involving the career DHS employee has not been previously reported. Experts say it raises questions about unequal punishment for inadvertent leakers in the Trump administration.",
      "Mary McCord, a former top official in the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, which investigates the mishandling or leaking of classified information, said the two cases should be treated the same way.",
      "\"Both of these are examples of carelessness in the handling of highly sensitive information, the disclosure of which could put U.S. government employees or military members in danger,\" added McCord, who is now a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. \"We should expect the Signal chat breach to be taken at least as seriously\" as the DHS employee's breach.",
      "The DHS employee who was put on leave did not speak to NBC News. The officials who did speak didn't want to identify her out of fear she would face retaliation from members of the public who are pro-immigration enforcement.",
      "The DHS employee told colleagues she accidentally added a reporter from a conservative Washington-based print publication to an email that included information about upcoming ICE operations in the Denver area.\u00a0The officials said the information was not classified but considered law enforcement sensitive because it included the time of day for the operation and possible home locations where targets could be identified.",
      "Realizing her mistake immediately, the employee called the reporter who agreed not to disclose the information, the officials said.",
      "The ICE operation took place without incident, the officials said.",
      "But another person on the email group flagged the blunder to higher-ups at DHS at a time when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan were blaming leaks to the media for lower-than-expected arrest numbers during ICE roundups, the officials said.",
      "Days later, the employee was placed on leave pending an investigation, the officials said. She was asked to take a polygraph test and surrender her personal cellphone, which she declined. She was then notified that the agency intends to revoke her security clearance, the officials said, which could keep her from working in the homeland security space again.",
      "The employee has 30 days to appeal the revocation, one official said.",
      "The employee has served in various agencies across DHS since President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, including during the entirety of Trump\u2019s first term, the officials said.",
      "A DHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In the Signal incident, Hegseth shared details of upcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen, according to text messages shared by The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included in the chat.",
      "Even though Hegseth provided\u00a0the precise timing of planned fighter jet and drone launches and when bombs would hit their intended targets, the Trump administration has said no classified material was shared in the chat.",
      "Houser, the former ICE chief of staff, said the employee had a reputation for being \"mission-focused\" and \"apolitical.\"",
      "\"Targeting a career official who dedicated her service to protecting public safety and enforcing the law \u2014 while excusing political appointees who leaked sensitive war plans \u2014 shows this administration punishes integrity and protects recklessness. That doesn\u2019t just betray her, it weakens every public servant who risks their career to do the right thing,\" Houser said.",
      "\"It's staggering hypocrisy,\" he added. Houser noted that the career official was put on leave for sharing information that was not classified, \"while political appointees leak classified war plans and face zero consequences. This isn\u2019t just a double standard \u2014 it\u2019s reckless and dangerous.\"",
      "One former DHS official told NBC News that the Trump administration should review its handling of the case of the DHS career employee who accidentally emailed ICE plans in light of the news of the Signal chat involving Waltz, Hegseth and Goldberg.",
      "\"Career civilians and military suffer severe penalties for inadvertent mistakes significantly less serious,\" the former DHS official said. \"The inconsistency is appalling.\""

      "A key question that remains is whether any classified information was posted in the chat, something the administration denies. Still, Democrats and former national security officials claim that detailed plans ahead of the attacks sent in the group by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should have been considered classified.",
      "In response to a request for comment for this story, the White House deferred to Trump and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s past remarks.",
      "Here's a timeline of the Trump administration's responses to The Atlantic story since it went live on Monday.",
      "Monday, March 24: The White House learns about the story",
      "At a White House event with executives from Hyundai, Trump fielded the first questions about the story, telling reporters, \"I don\u2019t know anything about it,\" and going on to express his disdain for the magazine.",
      "The president added that the attack on the Houthis discussed in the Signal chat \"was very effective.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t know anything about it. You, you\u2019re telling me about it for the first time,\" he added about the story.",
      "Later, Leavitt echoed Trump's remarks, telling NBC News in a statement, \"As President Trump said, the attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective.\"",
      "She added that the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including national security adviser Mike Waltz.\u201d",
      "After he landed in Hawaii late Monday, Hegseth blasted Goldberg and said, \"Nobody was texting war plans and that\u2019s all I have to say about that.\"",
      "Tuesday, March 25: Senior intelligence officials face questions on Capitol Hill",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard faced a barrage of questions on Tuesday during a Senate hearing that was scheduled well before Monday's Atlantic article dropped.",
      "In testimony to Senate lawmakers, Ratcliffe acknowledged that he was one of the administration officials in the Signal chat and said the text thread was \"lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "Gabbard, on the other hand, dodged questions about whether she was a participant in the Signal chat, but told lawmakers, \"there was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group.\"",
      "During an ambassador meeting at the White House on the same day, Trump reiterated the claim, telling reporters, \u201cThere was no classified information, as I understand it. They used an app, if you want to call it an app that a lot of people use, a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use.\u201d",
      "Trump defended Waltz in an interview with NBC News, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he\u2019s a good man.\" Trump also blamed Goldberg's inclusion in the chat on \"one of Michael\u2019s people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday, Waltz took \"full responsibility\" for the mistake and said that a staffer was not to blame. He said that Goldberg was added to the chat because the journalist's number was listed under another person's name.",
      "\"Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean, is something we\u2019re trying to figure out,\" he said. \"We're going to improve it. We're going to fix it. We're going to move forward to achieve the president's agenda.\"",
      "Hegseth, in Hawaii on Tuesday, once again reiterated to reporters that \"nobody's texting war plans, and that's all I have to say.\"",
      "\"I know exactly what I'm doing, exactly what we're directing, and I'm really proud of what we accomplished, the successful missions that night and going forward,\" the defense secretary added.",
      "Wednesday, March 26: Full transcript of group chat is released",
      "Following two days of denial from the administration that classified material was discussed over Signal, The Atlantic on Wednesday published the full transcript of the group chat. In response, some Trump administration officials focused on the fact that The Atlantic initially used the term \"war plans\" to describe the topic of conversation but on Wednesday referred to \"attack plans.\"",
      "\"No\u00a0locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS,\" Waltz wrote in a post on X.",
      "\"These were NOT 'war plans,'\" Leavitt wrote in a post on X, continuing to bash Goldberg.",
      "In remarks to reporters while boarding a plane to Guam, Hegseth again claimed, \"Nobody\u2019s texting war plans.\"",
      "\"And as a matter of fact, they even changed the title to 'attack plans,'\" Hegseth added, referencing the headline of Wednesday's Atlantic piece, \"because they know it's not war plans. There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information.\"",
      "Wednesday's story included messages where Hegseth specified types of U.S. military aircraft and the timing of recent airstrikes against Houthi militias in Yemen. The texts did not include information about specific targets.",
      "In a Wednesday interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Goldberg insisted that \"attack plans\" replacing \"war plans\" in his headline was a distinction without a difference.",
      "\"What are they arguing? That an attack is different than a war? Or they put operational details of a forthcoming attack on a terrorist organization ... into a Signal chat that included phone numbers that they didn\u2019t recognize?\" Goldberg said. \"I don\u2019t even understand what that means. They\u2019re talking about attacking and killing terrorists using various weapon systems.\"",
      "The Atlantic editor-in-chief went on to accuse Leavitt of playing \"some sort of weird semantic game\" in her earlier post on X.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe appeared at another congressional hearing, this time in front of the House Intelligence Committee. Gabbard echoed comments made by Hegseth and others, saying, \u201cThe conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the president and national security adviser stated, no classified information was shared. There were no sources, methods,\u00a0locations\u00a0or war plans that were shared.\u201d",
      "Trump also downplayed the story during an executive order signing, blaming the press while also distancing himself from the discussion. \"I think it\u2019s all a\u00a0witch\u00a0hunt,\" he said.\u00a0\"That\u2019s all. I think it\u2019s a\u00a0witch\u00a0hunt. I wasn\u2019t involved with it.\"",
      "But as lawmakers and national security experts began to raise concerns about the specific military details seen in the transcripts, some administration officials also began to soften their language around whether or not there was classified information.",
      "During the executive order signing, Trump was asked if he still believed that nothing classified was shared during the Signal conversation. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure, you\u2019ll have to ask the various people involved. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in his first public remarks about the incident, said that he had \"been assured by the Pentagon and everyone involved that none of the information that was on there \u2014 though not intended to be divulged, obviously, that was a mistake and that shouldn\u2019t have happened, and the White House is looking at it \u2014 but that none of the information on there at any point threatened the operation of the lives of our servicemen.\"",
      "Asked if any of the information discussed was classified, Rubio said, \"Well, the Pentagon says it was not, and not only do they say it was not, they make very clear that it didn\u2019t put in danger anyone\u2019s life or the mission.\"",
      "Thursday, March 27: Senators push for answers",
      "Congressional pressure has continued to grow in the days since the chats were revealed. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., sent a letter to the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense\u00a0asking for a formal review of the situation and a briefing once that review is complete. Reed told reporters on Wednesday that\u00a0if no review happens, \"you have to assume the worst.\u201d",
      "Leavitt on Thursday struck a softer tone on the story, telling reporters outside of the White House, \u201cWell, we have never denied that this was a mistake, and the national security adviser took, took responsibility for that, and we have said we are making changes. We are looking into the matter to ensure it can never happen again.\u201d",
      "In a news conference, Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on the matter for the first time, declining to say whether the Justice Department would investigate the disclosure of military plans in the Signal chat.",
      "\u201cIt was sensitive information \u2014 not classified \u2014 and inadvertently released,\u201d she told reporters, \u201cand what we should be talking about was: it was a very successful operation.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise\u2019s agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump\u2019s America First policies,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "CBS News\u00a0was first to report that Trump was considering withdrawing her nomination.",
      "The unexpected development marks a significant blow to Stefanik, a Trump loyalist and rising star in the party. Stefanik was reported favorably out of the Foreign Relations Committee at the end of January, but never received a confirmation vote in the full Senate.",
      "Stefanik\u2019s Instagram stories on Thursday featured highlights of her decadelong congressional career. One House Republican close to her said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., had informed lawmakers he was planning to host a going-away party for Stefanik on Monday.",
      "Senate Republicans had anticipated Stefanik would be easily confirmed.",
      "\u201cShe must be so disappointed. She would have been easily confirmed in my view,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said after the news broke. \u201cI thought she was a great nominee.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., chalked up Stefanik\u2019s withdrawl to the\u00a0\u201cpolitical realities that they\u2019re grappling with in the House right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery vote counts,\u201d\u00a0Thune said.",
      "While nearly all other of Trump\u2019s high-level administration appointments have been confirmed by the Senate, the upper chamber has\u00a0slow-walked Stefanik\u2019s confirmation\u00a0for weeks due to concerns over House Republicans\u2019 narrow majority.",
      "The GOP currently controls 218 seats in the House to 213 for the Democrats, meaning the speaker can only afford a minimum of two defections on votes. Republicans are hoping to add reinforcements after next week\u2019s special elections to fill two vacant deep-red House seats in Florida.",
      "But there is concern in the party that the race in Florida\u2019s 6th Congressional District for a seat previously held by Michael Waltz, who is now the national security adviser, is more competitive than expected after the Democratic candidate posted a massive fundraising haul.",
      "Stefanik cited \"special elections\" in her Fox News comments, without specifying the Florida race.",
      "Had Stefanik been confirmed to the U.N. ambassador post, it would have opened up another GOP-held seat and set up a special election in upstate New York that may not have taken place for months. Trump's Truth Social post hinted at concerns about holding the seat, even though he easily carried it in the 2024 election.",
      "National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said of Stefanik\u2019s district: \u201cWe\u2019d win this seat in a special election, and we\u2019ll win it in a general election.\u201d",
      "On multiple occasions this year, Trump and Johnson have needed Stefanik\u2019s vote to advance Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "On Feb. 25, House Republicans\u00a0adopted a budget resolution\u00a0with zero votes to spare, a critical step to begin the process to pass Trump\u2019s sweeping border, energy and tax policy plans.",
      "And just this month, the House\u00a0narrowly voted to pass a six-month GOP funding bill\u00a0to avert a government shutdown,\u00a0jamming Senate Democrats\u00a0who despised the proposal.",
      "In the coming months, House Republicans will face another difficult gantlet as they try to pass their\u00a0reconciliation package\u00a0that contains many of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign promises.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the move shows  the political tide is turning against the GOP.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump won the Elise Stefanik district by 21 points in November 2024. He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her,\u201d Jeffries said in a statement. \u201cThe Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?\u201d",
      "Early in her political career, Stefanik worked in the George W. Bush White House and later worked on the Romney-Ryan campaign in 2012.",
      "Stefanik was just 30 when she was first elected to the House, making history at the time as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. She previously served as a co-chair of the Tuesday Group, a bloc of moderate House Republicans.",
      "But with Trump\u2019s rise, Stefanik fashioned herself as a conservative MAGA warrior. Already popular in Trump world, her star rose even further in 2023 when she pointedly questioned the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology over their policies and handling of antisemitic incidents on their campuses.",
      "University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and Harvard President Claudine Gay both resigned following the hearing."

      "\"I said 'yes' before they finished the sentence,\" he recalls in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "White died in 2021\u00a0at the age of 99. Now, the late actor, known for her roles in \"The Golden Girls\" and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" is being honored with a Forever Stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service starting March 27.",
      "The stamp celebrates White\u2019s decades-long entertainment career and her advocacy for animals, an element subtly woven into Stephanos\u2019s design.",
      "For Stephanos, who has spent decades creating portraits for outlets like Rolling Stone, Mad Magazine, and Sports Illustrated, the Betty White stamp was particularly meaningful. The illustrator learned his conception for the stamp had been approved just days before his mother died.",
      "\"This is now a very, very personal piece for me,\" he says. \"[My mother] got to see her son do something really cool.\"",
      "Stephanos recalls gathering around a television with his family to watch White on TV. His grandmother had also been named Betty, and in her final days, his mother, despite being in poor health, saw the design go viral.",
      "Stephanos recognized something familiar in White\u2019s trademark blend of wit and warmth \u2014 qualities that reminded him of home.",
      "\"She reminded me of my mother. She had this real ability to say something, and then jaws would drop, and people would be like, \u2018Did she really just say that?'\" he says. \"She\u2019s one of those people who could get away with things that a lot of people couldn\u2019t because she was an older lady, and she had that sweet smile, and it\u2019s delivery \u2014 it was never mean. It was never mean. It was always good humor, even when she was roasting somebody.\"",
      "For the stamp, Stephanos drew inspiration from a\u00a0portrait of White taken by Kwaku Alston in 2010. Alston\u2019s photograph shows White in the later part of her career, wearing red, eyes bright with her signature spark.",
      "\"It\u2019s just a great photo \u2014\u00a0a sweet spot in her older years,\" he says. \"I just kind of used that as reference and then kind of changed the colors and tried to make it more handmade than a photo would be.\"",
      "Stephanos\u2019 image is a stylized portrait of White dressed in purple instead of red to reflect a deeper part of White\u2019s legacy.",
      "\"Purple is the color of protest. She had such a positive personality. She never seemed angry, even though protest is a form of anger,\u201d he says.",
      "Even the earring he chose for White was selected with care.",
      "Stephanos sought a subtle way to reflect Betty White\u2019s animal advocacy in the stamp after her estate requested it be part of the design. One morning, Stephanos noticed his wife\u2019s animal-print dress and shiny earrings. He looked down and realized he had drawn a paw print, and an idea clicked.",
      "\"I was like, 'Oh, wait a minute. We could just do a paw print earring,'\" he says.",
      "The small but meaningful detail was ultimately approved and became part of the final stamp, which can be seen on White\u2019s right ear in the portrait.",
      "Stephanos thinks of stamps as \"little pieces of art\" that \"dress up our correspondence.\"",
      "\"I know when I get something with an interesting stamp, I take a second, I look at it and appreciate it. I think it\u2019s one of the great things that humans have figured out: a way to communicate in this way,\" he says.",
      "It\u2019s part of why White\u2019s stamp means so much to him.",
      "\"This is the only stamp I\u2019m going to use for the rest of my life,\" he says with a laugh. \"I\u2019m going to be so obnoxious with this.\"",
      "When asked what kind of message he\u2019d send with it, his answer is certain.",
      "\"She was such a positive, funny, witty, bright light,\" he says. \"I think anything that you want to send with a kind of a positive, happy tone (her stamp) would totally be appropriate.\""

All four No. 1 seeds are still alive, and there\u2019s plenty of talent on the rosters who are trying to upset them en route to the Elite Eight.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s to come in the tournament\u2019s second weekend.",
      "No. 6 BYU vs. No. 2 Alabama (7:09 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "This matchup figures to be a shootout between the top offense in the country (the Crimson Tide) and another that averages over 80 points per game (the Cougars). Alabama is in the Sweet 16 for the third straight season, and it has to be feeling confident after it cruised to victory in the second round despite a subpar performance by senior guard Mark Sears. BYU, meanwhile, sneaked past Wisconsin with a two-point win in the second round. Can the Cougars keep up with the Crimson Tide?",
      "No. 4 Maryland vs. No. 1 Florida (7:39 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "The Terrapins and the Gators are both coming off thrilling wins, with Maryland needing a Derik Queen buzzer-beater to put away Colorado State, while Florida executed a late comeback to knock off defending champ Connecticut. The Terps are likely to have their hands full with Gators guard Walter Clayton Jr., who has been shooting lights out through two tournament games. Clayton has scored 23 in each of the first two rounds and has hit nine of his 17 3-point attempts.",
      "No. 4 Arizona vs. No. 1 Duke (9:39 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "The Blue Devils have arguably been the most impressive team in the men\u2019s bracket, winning their first two games by an average of 33.5 points. Duke is going to be heavily favored again in this one, and it has actually already beaten the Wildcats this season. If Arizona has any chance, senior guard Caleb Love will need to have a big night, as he did against Oregon in the last round. Love, who played for North Carolina for three years, will at least be very familiar with his opponent.",
      "No. 10 Arkansas vs. No. 3 Texas Tech (10:09 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "The Razorbacks are the lowest seed left in the men\u2019s tournament and the closest we have to a Cinderella story. Arkansas is coming off one of the best wins of the tournament, as head coach John Calipari exacted a little revenge on longtime foe Rick Pitino and the St. John\u2019s Red Storm with an upset win. Can Calipari continue his Razorbacks renaissance? Arkansas may be ranked 10th in this region, but the team has come a long way since it started 0-5 in SEC play.",
      "No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 2 Michigan State (7:09 ET Friday)",
      "A game that will be both a clash of styles and programs. The Spartans are in their 16th Sweet 16 under Tom Izzo, while the Rebels have made it past the second round for the first time since 2001. Ole Miss\u2019 success in the tournament has in large part been due to the long ball, as the Rebels are shooting 48.7% from deep through two games. Michigan State likes to get physical defensively, and Ole Miss will have to be prepared for a grittier game.",
      "No. 3 Kentucky vs. No. 2 Tennessee (7:39 p.m. ET Friday)",
      "These SEC foes will meet for the third time this year in Indianapolis, and the Wildcats have had the upper hand so far. Kentucky won both matchups against the Volunteers in the regular season, and in particular it gave Tennessee\u2019s offense fits. The Vols shot only 22.2% from 3-point range in their two losses to the Wildcats, unable to get shots to fall from outside. Tennessee is still favored in this one, but its mettle will be tested if shots aren\u2019t falling early.",

      "No. 5 Michigan vs. No. 1 Auburn (9:39 p.m. ET Friday)",
      "The Wolverines lost three straight to end the regular season but have been on a roll since, winning the Big Ten tournament before making their way to the Sweet 16. The frontcourt will be worth keeping an eye on in this game, as Michigan will throw out a combo of 7-footers \u2014 centers Danny Wolf and Vladislav Goldin \u2014 to counter the effectiveness of Auburn big man Johni Broome.",
      "No. 4 Purdue vs. No. 1 Houston (10:09 p.m. ET Friday)",
      "The final matchup of the weekend will be a pseudo-home game for the Boilermakers, with Lucas Oil Stadium only about 65 miles from Purdue\u2019s campus. Will a home-court boost be enough for the Boilermakers\u2019 offense, however? Purdue will need all the extra juice it can get to upset the Cougars, who are incredibly stingy on defense. Houston leads the country in points allowed per game, and only one opponent has broken 70 points in its last five contests."

    "summary": "The order states that Vice President JD Vance will be in charge of efforts to prohibit federal funding for Smithsonian programs that are not in line with the administration's goals.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday taking aim at the Smithsonian and its museums, education and research centers.",
      "Trump directed Vice President JD Vance to eliminate \u201cimproper, divisive, or anti-American\u201d ideology from programs at the Smithsonian Institution, which receives federal funding.",
      "\u201cOnce widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" the order reads.\u00a0\"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\u201d",
      "In the order, Trump accuses the Biden administration of advancing \u201ccorrosive ideology\u201d at the museums, singling out certain entities, like the National Museum of African American History and Culture that he said perpetuated \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201crace-centered\u201d ideas.",
      "Representatives for the Smithsonian Institution did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday night.",
      "Vance, who is a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, will also be tasked with working with congressional leaders to appoint board members who are \u201ccommitted to advancing the celebration of America\u2019s extraordinary heritage and progress.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s order further directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum\u00a0to restore federal parks and monuments that have been \u201cimproperly removed or changed\u201d in the last five years to perpetuate \u201ca false revision of history\u00a0or improperly minimize or disparage certain historical figures or events.\u201d",
      "The order is in line with Trump's rationale for reverting the name of Alaska\u2019s Mount Denali to Mount McKinley, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's explanation for reversing a Biden administration decision to rename military bases honoring Confederate leaders.",
      "The order comes as the Trump administration presses forward in its war on diversity, equity and inclusion, a widely used label applied to efforts to improve workplace culture and create more opportunities for disadvantaged groups.",
      "Trump has issued directives placing all federal employees in DEI roles on administrative leave, closing all DEI-related offices and programs and removing mentions to the framework from all federal websites and social media accounts.",
      "Similarly, the Education Department this month\u00a0announced investigations into more\u00a0than 50 universities it accused of \u201cengaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs.\u201d",
      "And the Defense Department this month deleted thousands of pages honoring contributions by women, Black, Native American and other minority groups as part of an effort to ensure it did not promote any DEI concepts. Some of the pages were restored after public backlash.",
      "The Smithsonian Institution was created by Congress in 1846 to serve as an \"establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\"",
      "It consists of 21 museums, 14 education and research centers and the National Zoo, all maintained by more than 6,500 employees and more than 3,800 onsite volunteers. More than 17 million people visit the collection of museums annually.",
      "The Smithsonian has two sources of funding: federal appropriations and income generated from gifts, revenue-generating activities and investments. In its most recent budget request, the institution asked Congress for more than $1 billion to fund \"essential operating expenses.\"",
      "\"Donors tend to be attracted to museum openings and exhibitions, not the prosaic annual budgetary requirements of staffing, maintenance, and operations that we rely on the federal Government for help to meet. For all our collaborations and ancillary sources of funding, the U.S. Congress remains our most important partner,\" Lonnie G. Bunch, the secretary for the Smithsonian said in the request.",
      "Trump's order directs his administration to work with Congress to ensure that future Smithsonian funding does not go to exhibits or programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race, or promote ideologies inconsistent with Federal law\" or \"recognize men as women.\""

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-administration-takes-aim-immigrant-students-rcna198346",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:58:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has been targeting foreign-born graduate and doctoral students whose main transgression seems to be activism.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday the State Department has revoked 300 or more student visas, as the White House increasingly targets foreign-born students whose main transgression seems to be activism.",
      "Rubio warned that the administration was looking out for \u201cthese lunatics.\u201d Around the country, scholars have been picked up, in some cases by masked immigration agents, and held in detention centers, sometimes a thousand miles from their homes with little warning and often with few details about why they were being detained.",
      "\u201cIt might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,\u201d Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana, where he was meeting with leaders.",
      "Many of those rounded up by Trump officials attended or were part of the pro-Palestinian movement that swept college campuses last year, and while the administration hasn\u2019t said publicly why these students are being singled out over others, at least one sought by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appeared on lists made by far-right pro-Israel groups as targets for deportation.",
      "And Trump allies, many in government again, telegraphed for months before he took office that they\u2019d seek to deport students who openly advocated for Hamas or other U.S.-designated terrorist groups or after they participated in an unauthorized campus protest and were suspended, expelled or jailed.",
      "The detentions are a signal of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to clamp down on the actions of legal permanent residents, student visa holders and others who live and work legally in the United States, one that threatens to undermine a fundamental American right to free speech and to assemble, experts and advocates said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something uniquely disturbing about sending a message to the best and the brightest around the world, who traditionally have flocked to U.S. universities because of their openness, because of their freedom, because of their intellectual vigor, and now say, \u2018We don\u2019t want you here,\u2019\u201d said Ben Wizner, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d Tom Homan, has repeatedly said the administration\u2019s deportation policy is \u201cworst first,\u201d meaning it is prioritizing removing people with criminal records or people suspected of being national security threats. According to the Department of Homeland Security data, there are at least 400,000 noncitizens convicted of crimes in the United States. The administration has sent more than 200 Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, alleging that the migrants have gang ties, claims that families and attorneys of some of those deported have strongly denied.",
      "Targeting students is a shift from their stated goal of going after criminals, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Bush-Joseph said that for noncitizens, \u201cthe government has so much discretion when it comes to granting or taking away immigration benefits, and that can be done based on a number of reasons.\u201d",
      "The State Department has used as justification for some student deportation proceedings an immigration provision that dates to the Cold War and gives Rubio the authority to deport noncitizens if their\u00a0 activities pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d And U.S. officials can revoke a student visa if they deem the student a threat.",
      "Some scholars have already been deported. And arrests continue. Just this week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested two students near their homes. One was Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student from Iran studying at the University of Alabama. ICE didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about Doroudi\u2019s immigration status or why he was arrested. The University said a doctoral student had been detained but gave no other details.",
      "Another was Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was in the United States with a valid student visa and pulled off the street.",
      "Ozturk co-authored an opinion essay in the Tufts student newspaper last year criticizing the university for how it responded to student demands, calling for the school to \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide\u201d and \u201cdivest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\u201d The essay, which was authored by four students and endorsed by 32 others, does not mention Hamas.",
      "In response to questions about Ozturk\u2019s arrest, Rubio questioned why \u201cany country in the world\u201d would allow people to come into their countries and disrupt college campuses.",
      "\u201cWe gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to be a social activist that comes in and tears up our university campuses,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf you invite me into your home because I say, \u2018Oh, I want to go to your house for dinner,\u2019 and I come into your house and I start putting mud on your couch and spray-painting your kitchen, I bet you you\u2019re going to kick me out,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "Ozturk is being held at a Louisiana detention facility. It\u2019s not clear where Doroudi has been sent, and little is known about his case.",
      "The National Iranian American Council demanded information on Doroudi\u2019s whereabouts and whether he\u2019d been charged with a crime and called for those \u201cunjustly detained\u201d to be released.",
      "\u201cDoroudi\u2019s arrest comes on the heels of the baseless arrest of students and a green card holder as apparent retaliation against their speech and activism against war,\u201d the group said.",
      "Meanwhile, one far-right group has compiled names and other identifying information of students and professionals  \u2014 both noncitizens and U.S. citizens \u2014 who are alleged to be \u201cpromoting hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews on college campuses,\u201d saying its goal is to combat antisemitism on campuses. Another group says it handed the Trump administration a list of hundreds of names for deportation; at least one of the students listed on both sites, Momodou Taal, has been targeted by the Trump administration for deportation and asked to surrender to ICE. Taal, a Ph.D. student who is a U.S. visa holder, participated in protests at Cornell University expressing support for Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Among the other students targeted by the Trump administration:",
      "\u2014 Yunseo Chung, 21, a Columbia University student who took part in the protests. She is a legal permanent resident and doesn\u2019t need a student visa; she moved to the United States as a child from South Korea. She is fighting deportation in court, and last week, a federal judge ruled that she can\u2019t be detained as the legal case continues.",
      "\u2014 Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian student who participated in the protests at Columbia last spring. Immigration officials say she had overstayed her student visa and was arrested by ICE.",
      "\u2014 Badar Khan Suri, a graduate student from India who was teaching at Georgetown University on a student visa when he was arrested this month. Suri filed a court petition in Alexandria, Virginia, in hope of being released from detention. He is being held at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, according to the ICE detainee locator. Homeland Security officials said on X he was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and Columbia University graduate student who was detained over his pro-Palestinian activism on campus, immigration officials said. He\u2019s being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Facility in Jena. A federal judge in New York recently ruled that a challenge to his arrest and detention should be heard in New Jersey. The judge issued an order blocking the government from deporting Khalil as his case proceeds. He also faces a separate deportation case in immigration court in Louisiana, with his next hearing set for early April.",
      "Samah Sisay, one of Khalil\u2019s lawyers, said lawyers and advocates are concerned that more students will be targeted and that many may also face criminal charges for their activism if government officials cite potential terrorism concerns.",
      "\u201cNone of them have criminal records,\u201d Sisay said. \u201cThis is an attack on speech, and I think any sort of criminal allegations that may be brought in the future would still be attached to this desire to chill free speech and to really say that certain speech is not welcomed under this administration and can lead to you being criminalized, detained, and deported.\u201d",
      "And it\u2019s increasingly unclear whether colleges will support students in the face of growing efforts to deport students who speak out. Just last week, Columbia University bowed to Trump\u2019s demands after he threatened to cancel $400 million in federal research grants for \u201cinaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u201d The university agreed to sweeping changes.",
      "Ranjani Srinavasan, a Columbia University doctoral student from India, isn\u2019t detained by ICE, because she left for Canada, instead.",
      "She told NBC News she got a message on March 5 from the U.S. consulate in Chennai, India, that her student visa had been revoked. She said she had participated in some protests. On the night of a large demonstration where students occupied Hamilton Hall, she had been trying to get to her dorm and was among the dozens swept up by police, but the charges were late dropped, her lawyer said.",
      "Two days later, ICE agents turned up at her apartment, but another person in the apartment with her didn\u2019t let them in because they didn\u2019t have a warrant, Srinavasan said. The agents returned the next day, and again were not let inside. Then, Srinavasan got a message from the international student office saying that her visa had been revoked and that she had to leave the United States and the school.",
      "Until then, she had been grading papers as a teaching assistant and finishing out the last six months in her five-year Ph.D. program.",
      "\u201cIf I had opened the door,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cI would be in a detention center now.\u201d"

    "summary": "Seven members of the Department of Government Efficiency broke their media blockade and sat for a group interview with Fox News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has had one public face since late January: tech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk, who posts nearly constantly about DOGE on social media and has given several media interviews about its budget-slashing effort.",
      "Musk said as recently as last month that it was a \u201ccrime\u201d to publicly name other people who worked at DOGE, and his strict secrecy helped to keep DOGE employees out of the spotlight, even as they went about radically remaking the federal government and trying to dismantle entire agencies.",
      "But in a switch, Musk introduced a few other faces Thursday in a group interview on Fox News that featured some of his chief lieutenants. They included DOGE staffers who have worked quietly behind the scenes to upend key components of the U.S. government such as the Treasury Department and the Social Security Administration.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Seven DOGE employees participated in the interview on \u201cSpecial Report\u201d hosted by Bret Baier, and it was by far their most extensive public comments since President Donald Trump began his second term Jan. 20.",
      "The seven DOGE staffers struck a more technocratic tone than Musk often does in his rhetoric about the federal government. None referenced a chainsaw or a wood chipper \u2014 two of Musk\u2019s go-to analogies \u2014 choosing instead to talk about the duplication they see in government software systems.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that the government can have an Apple Store-like experience: beautifully designed, great user experience, modern systems,\u201d said Joe Gebbia, a co-founder of Airbnb who is focused on overhauling the retirement system for federal workers.",
      "Gebbia has a net worth of $8 billion, making him one of the 400 wealthiest people in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk is ranked first, with $337 billion.",
      "DOGE staffers have generally kept a low profile, with news organizations relying sometimes on anonymous sources to compile lists of DOGE employees in defiance of threats by Musk.",
      "But some of the staffers interviewed Thursday, including Tom Krause, had previously popped up in lawsuits challenging DOGE\u2019s authority. In February, after a lawsuit by labor unions, the Trump administration agreed that Krause\u2019s access to Treasury Department payment systems would be \u201cread only,\u201d without the authority to make changes.",
      "Krause told Fox News\u2019 Baier that he wants to be able to audit all the payments the government makes.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is applying private company standards to the federal government,\u201d he said.",
      "The interview did not include some of the most-talked-about DOGE staffers, such as one 19-year-old who has gone by the nickname \u201cBig Balls.\u201d",
      "All seven of the interviewed staffers are men, and they did not include Amy Gleason, the person whom the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE. Her name did not come up in the hour-long Fox News program, and Trump has repeatedly said that Musk is the head of DOGE.",
      "All seven are also new to government work, with some of them including Steve Davis joining from Musk\u2019s private companies. Davis has worked at Musk\u2019s SpaceX and The Boring Co. and he has been an investor in Musk\u2019s social media app, X.",
      "Davis said the stakes for DOGE were high, arguing that the country was at risk of \u201cgoing bankrupt.\u201d",
      "Another DOGE staffer, Anthony Armstrong, formerly a Morgan Stanley investment banker who worked on Musk\u2019s deal to buy X, said in the interview that he did not believe the changes brought on by DOGE had been as radical as critics argue. He said that reductions-in-force, or firings, amounted to less than 0.15% of the federal workforce, and he said there was still money \u201csloshing out the door.\u201d",
      "The other DOGE staffers interviewed were Aram Moghaddassi, who specializes in the Social Security system, Brad Smith, who works with the Department of Health and Human Services, and Tyler Hassen, who\u2019s assigned to the Interior Department.",
      "Musk frequently chimed in as Baier questioned the seven DOGE staffers, generally to emphasize their points or rephrase their answers. Backing up Armstrong, Musk argued that, \u201cBasically, almost no one\u2019s gotten fired.\u201d",
      "Asked by Baier about rulings by several federal judges that DOGE had exceeded its legal authority, Musk went on the offensive and argued, without naming specifics, that the federal judges are corrupt.",
      "Musk said he remained committed to DOGE\u2019s goal of cutting the federal budget deficit by $1 trillion, though he reframed the goal in percentage terms, saying it would be a 15% reduction in spending. Musk also appeared to endorse sparing Social Security from cuts, saying that people who are \u201clegitimate\u201d beneficiaries would see their benefits go up, not down, although he did not define the term.",
      "\u201cWe feel confident that a 15% reduction can be done without affecting any of the critical government services,\u201d Musk said.",
      "But budget experts say that even if DOGE succeeds at slashing spending, Trump\u2019s policies including major tax cuts would still substantially add to the deficit if they came to fruition."

      "But Trump is also annoyed that the race to replace Waltz in Congress is\u00a0shaping up to be more competitive than it should be for Republicans \u2014 and next week's special election in Florida only opened up because Trump selected Waltz for his post in the administration.",
      "Even though GOP leaders are confident the Republican candidate in that special election, Randy Fine, will pull off a win, Trump is still worried that the optics are fueling a negative narrative and making the party look bad, the sources said. Trump is holding tele-town halls Thursday night for Fine and another Republican candidate in a second Florida special election. Had Stefanik been confirmed as U.N. ambassador, it would have created another special election and removed a Republican from the tightly divided House amid efforts to pass Trump's legislative agenda.",
      "The White House did not comment on questions about Trump's conversations Thursday.",
      "Trump's frustration with Waltz comes as a chorus of allies have called for Trump to fire the national security adviser as a fall guy for the group chat fiasco.",
      "But while Waltz came in for criticism because Goldberg's inclusion in the chat ultimately resulted in its publication, others have scrutinized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth more closely, because he shared details of military plans over a commercial app instead of using traditional government channels for sensitive information.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday asked the Defense Department's inspector general to open an investigation into the Signal chat and, specifically, whether department policies on classification and sharing sensitive information were broken. Wicker and the ranking member on the panel, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., sent the letter to the inspector general together.",
      "\u201cThe information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified,\u201d Wicker told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Yet Hegseth has gotten full-throated backing from Trump and others.",
      "\"Hegseth\u00a0is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this.\u00a0Hegseth? How do you bring\u00a0Hegseth\u00a0into it? He had nothing to do,\" Trump said Wednesday in response to questions from reporters.",
      "In the same media availability, Trump said of Waltz, \"Mike Waltz, I guess he said he claimed responsibility,\" before adding: \"But again, the attacks were unbelievably successful, and that\u2019s ultimately what you should be talking about.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that Trump \"continues to have confidence in his national security team.\"",
      "Hegseth has defended himself by telling reporters there was \"no classified information\" in the chat, a refrain the administration and many other Republicans have adopted as well.",
      "\"There\u2019s no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information,\" Hegseth said Wednesday.",
      "Other MAGA allies have come to Hegseth's defense, too.",
      "\"We dare the media and these radical Democrats to come after Pete Hegseth,\" said Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump ally and aide in his first administration. \"We have his back.\"",
      "Still, one House Republican with experience in national security matters told NBC News on Thursday that Hegseth should resign, saying that if Biden-era Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had done what Hegseth did, \"we would have already drawn up, you know, impeachment and asked for his resignation.\""

      "A new focus group with Black men who voted for Donald Trump in swing states in November showed that nearly all of them remain staunchly with him, but that the Department of Government Efficiency and his tariffs are potential pain points.",
      "The group of 12 voters \u2014 who participated in a recent focus group observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 Deciders series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago \u2014 included six independents, four Democrats and two Republicans. Ten of them stood by their 2024 vote, with the remaining two saying they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump again if given a do-over.",
      "DOGE: The results were far more mixed when it came to Elon Musk and DOGE. Five said they approved of DOGE\u2019s actions, three said they disapproved and the rest weren\u2019t sure yet.",
      "Among those backing DOGE, the spending audits and cuts were seen as bringing a bit of the private sector to government work, aimed at increasing efficiency of employees paid by taxpayer money.",

You shouldn\u2019t be an untouchable, you shouldn\u2019t be a sacred cow,\u201d said Dorris S., a 56-year-old independent from Pennsylvania. \u201cThey\u2019re there to maximize productivity and efficiency. I used to manage restaurants, we had health inspectors.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Thomas A., a 49-year-old Democrat from Georgia who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and switched to Trump in 2024, said that while DOGE is doing \u201csome good,\u201d he\u2019s concerned about the power Trump has delegated to Musk. He also wondered if DOGE\u2019s work could be antithetical to a push to improve the economy and help everyday Americans.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s too focused on cutting the weeds and the clutter, but he needs to focus on the economy and how to help people,\u201d he said of Trump.",
      "Tariffs: Only three out of 12 participants affirmatively said Trump is making battling inflation a top priority, with those who said so largely connecting it to his threats to enact sweeping tariffs or cut government spending. The two voters who disapproved of Trump after voting for him both raised concerns about tariffs.",
      "Democrats: Still, this group of voters was down on the Democrats, using words such as \u201cliars,\u201d \u201cuntrustworthy,\u201d \u201cungodly,\u201d \u201ca weird agenda\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d to describe the party today.",

      "This telling puts National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the hot seat \u2014 absolving the rest of the senior officials in the chat \u2014 and diverts attention from the most alarming aspects of the episode.",
      "The White House would like to gloss over that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared military operation plans against the Houthis outside of secure government communications systems.",
      "Similarly, Trump\u2019s team would prefer if no attention was paid to the fact that several Cabinet secretaries, the White House chief of staff and a White House deputy chief of staff appeared to have chosen not to object to using a commercial app that allows users to delete messages.",
      "Administration officials note that the strikes against the Houthis were successful, as though arriving home safely is a justification for reckless driving.",
      "White House officials and Attorney General Pam Bondi have insisted that none of the information was classified. That\u2019s also a distraction. Even if the information was classified, there\u2019s no world in which the White House would admit all of those people would be careless with this information. It\u2019s also irrelevant as a practical matter because Bondi would never prosecute department and agency leaders.",
      "None of these excuses serve Trump well. They don\u2019t make him look stronger or more committed to national security.",
      "As NBC News reported Wednesday, it\u2019s not just Democrats calling on Trump to fire someone. There are MAGA Republicans who think Trump should find someone to take the fall. If he doesn\u2019t, that risks leaving a stain on him. And there\u2019s no spinning out of that.",

      "A computer science student at Columbia University said he has been kicked out by the school after he built an artificial intelligence tool to cheat in tech job interviews and documented the fallout online.",
      "Chungin \u201cRoy\u201d Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world\u2019s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions.",
      "In a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time.",
      "It was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.\u201cI think 99% people probably haven\u2019t realized how far-reaching this could be,\u201d Lee told NBC News. \u201cIn the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems. But now that people are putting the two together, I think no form of online assessment is safe.\u201d",
      "Lee, who is in New York City, said he got the internship offer from Amazon this year. In February, he went online to broadcast that he \u201cused AI to pass my Amazon Interview.\u201d (The video got about 100,000 views before YouTube removed it, citing a copyright claim by Amazon.)",
      "Lee claims he used Interview Coder to nab offers from all four of the companies he tested it on: Amazon, Capital One, Meta and TikTok. He said that he rejected Amazon\u2019s offer and that several of the other companies rescinded their offers after he publicly posted about his use of AI.",
      "As a result of his publicized stunt, Columbia University ushered Lee through a disciplinary process that resulted in a yearlong suspension, he said. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on individual students, citing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations.",
      "Margaret Callahan, a spokesperson for Amazon, said that while the company welcomes candidates\u2019 sharing their experiences working with generative AI tools when it\u2019s relevant to the roles they\u2019re applying for, they must also acknowledge that they won\u2019t use unauthorized tools \u2014 such as generative AI technology \u2014 to help them\u00a0during the interview or assessment process.",
      "Capital One, Meta and TikTok didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Since he began documenting his journey on social media roughly a month ago, Lee said, Interview Coder has had user growth of 50% week over week, and it\u2019s now making $170,000 in monthly subscriptions.",
      "He has continued building his brand online as a combative rule breaker by\u00a0posting what he claims to be emails with recruiters and documents from his subsequent disciplinary process with Columbia. He has gained more than 43,000 new followers on X, where he has seen the most support for his stunt. On LinkedIn, where he has also gained about new 11,000 followers, the reactions have been more mixed, with some users calling his product \u201cmorally unethical\u201d or \u201ccorrupt.\u201d",
      "Lee said he\u2019s \u201cnot really worried about burning bridges\u201d within the academic and corporate worlds at the start of his career, as he prefers to invest in entrepreneurship.",
      "Trolling the companies, he said, was an act of protest against what he perceives as their overreliance on LeetCode, a popular online platform that provides preparatory questions for coding interviews.",
      "\u201cI was in the top 2% of global LeetCode users, and this was probably, like, the 600 most miserable hours of my life when programming,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe questions are not indicative of what you do in the real world. They\u2019re riddles that you have to memorize.\u201d",
      "Other AI-powered interview cheating apps, such as Leetcode Wizard, which touts successful results for thousands of users, have also become increasingly popular during the generative AI boom of recent years.",
      "Some of them specifically tap into what many software engineers have expressed as a growing disillusionment with LeetCode.",
      "LeetCode \u201cdoesn\u2019t properly allow engineers to demonstrate their abilities when it comes to programming, while also ignoring the use of AI in daily programming work,\u201d Isabel de Vries, Leetcode Wizard\u2019s head of marketing, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that candidates would want to use similar tools during their interviews.\u201d",
      "Lee said he knew posting his Amazon interview would be a \u201creally visual, viral way\u201d to tackle the issue that motivated him to create Interview Coder in the first place. He said success would mean getting big tech companies to change their interview formats. Now that tools like his are rising in use and popularity, the genie can\u2019t be put back in the bottle.",
      "\u201cI think cheating on these online assessment interviews is really much more common than people think,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMany CS students who are pretty serious about recruiting and stuff know that there are apps like this. It\u2019s just not understood at a large scale.\u201d"

      "The U.S. Health and Human Services said earlier this month that the Maine Department of Education, Maine Principals\u2019 Association and a high school are each in violation of Title IX because of the participation of transgender athletes. The federal investigation came after a public spat between Trump and Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills about the subject.",
      "The health department gave the institutions ten days to comply with a voluntary agreement to settle the issue by banning the athletes. The principals\u2019 association, which oversees high school sports in the state and School Administrative District 51, which includes Greely High School, both said they will not comply with the agreement.",
      "The federal health department cited Greely High School, in the Portland suburb of Cumberland, because of a report that a transgender student won a girls\u2019 track competition. The district said in a letter to the community Thursday that is not complying because it will instead \u201ccontinue to follow state law and the Maine Human Rights Act.\u201d",
      "The district statement also said: \u201cTo our students: Thank you for your maturity, perseverance, and dedication to learning through these distractions. Please continue to lead the way.\u201d",
      "The Maine Principals\u2019 Association said in a statement it is also \u201cbound by the law, including the Maine Human Rights Act, which our participation policy reflects.\u201d A spokesperson for the Maine Department of Education referred the matter to the state attorney general\u2019s office, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also did not respond to a request for comment.

      "Mills and Trump sparred over the subject last month during a meeting of governors at the White House. During the meeting, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state does not comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports.",

      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: Spoilers ahead for Season Eight, Episode 12, of \"9-1-1.\"",
      "After 11 episodes apart, Eddie Diaz has finally reunited with his son, Christopher, on \"9-1-1.\"",
      "Season Eight, Episode 12, of the ABC drama picked up three weeks after Episode 10, when Eddie (Ryan Guzman) moved back home to El Paso, Texas, to reunite with Chris (Gavin McHugh), who left Los Angeles at the end of Season Seven.",
      "The episode, titled \"Disconnected,\" also saw dispatcher Maddie Han (Jennifer Love Hewitt) deal with the aftermath of her kidnapping.",
      "At the end of the midseason premiere, Maddie was taken from her home by police detective Amber Braeburn (Abigail Spencer), who turned out to be the serial killer Maddie and Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) had been looking for all along.",
      "Once firefighter husband Howie \"Chimney\" Han (Kenneth Choi) set out to try and rescue Maddie, and put himself in harm's way, she gave up trying to talk down Amber and fought back, starting a clash that resulted with her throat being slashed.",
      "\"I've got to put my characters through hell,\" showrunner Tim Minear tells TODAY.com. \"It was her turn. You know what? I spun that wheel. Her number came up.\"",
      "In Episode 12, Maddie tries to go back to work but on her first call, loses her voice, which turns out to be a psychological response to the trauma she faced.",
      "As she reels from being separated from her job, Eddie similarly struggles to find his footing in Texas. His house is proving to be a major fixer-upper, and he isn't able to join a local fire station in El Paso amid a hiring freeze. So, he trades in his tricked-out truck for a sedan with better gas mileage to become an Uber driver \u2014 a development he keeps from his parents and Chris.",
      "That is, until his son is the one hopping in the back of his car for a ride.",
      "After the awkward moment of truth, Eddie recaps the encounter over FaceTime to his best friend and former co-worker, Evan \"Buck\" Buckley (Oliver Stark), who encourages him to talk to Chris directly.",
      "While Eddie's texts to his son go unanswered, Chris surprises his dad by showing up at his house unannounced. The 14-year-old says he wants Eddie to stay in El Paso. Eddie then apologizes for lying about his current profession, telling Chris, \u201cI just wanted you to be proud of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am proud of you,\u201d Chris responds, and the father and son share a long-awaited hug.",
      "Maddie also ends the episode reconnecting with her daughter \u2014\u00a0verbally that is. After briefly losing track of Jee-Yun at a playground, Maddie struggles to shout her child's name, until her voice comes roaring back.",
      "Below, Minear breaks down Maddie's and Eddie\u2019s big breakthroughs in Episode 12 and previews what's ahead.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "To remind her where her power is, really.",
      "I just thought it was interesting. By being attacked the way she was, having her throat cut, that does sort of temporarily take away her voice, but then it becomes, like a psychological version of that. I sort of like the metaphor that Maddie's voice \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s the thing that people hear over that phone, and it\u2019s a tether to hope or death. So that voice is really her superpower.",
      "So we had several different versions of how her voice came back, and pretty much all of them were predicated on her child. But we did have what I felt were, like, sort of convoluted ways that it happened.",
      "And then I think it may have been (writer) Molly Green\u2019s idea to have her just be out in a public place. And a thing that any parent can actually really relate to is you turn around for a split second and you look back and you have that moment of panic, because it\u2019s like, \"Wait, where\u2019d my kid go?\"",
      "So, when she really needed her voice, it came back. And it\u2019s really because of the things that Athena was saying to her in a previous scene. That she has to wrestle with her own fear on her job, but then she thinks about the people that need her, and she muscles through. And that\u2019s exactly what happens to Maddie in that moment.",
      "I think Eddie feels like a bit of an outsider in his life. So I think what it would have looked like is kind of what you're seeing, where Eddie is going over to his parents' house for family dinners. His mother in particular is sort of taking on the role of parent, and so she's almost treating Eddie and Christopher like they were both her sons \u2014 almost treating Eddie like he's Christopher's brother, as opposed to his father.",
      "But the first thing Eddie needs to do is kind of like lay down some roots and get his house ready so that Christopher can move in.",
      "But his whole story so far has been that he doesn\u2019t want to spook his kid. He\u2019s approaching this in \u2014 I\u2019m not even advocating that he\u2019s made the right choice here \u2014 but he\u2019s approaching this in a very circumspect way. And he just, he wants to make sure that it\u2019s Chris\u2019 choice to come back. I think his mother in particular is kind of leveraging that against him a little bit.",
      "I think he is learning Father Brian\u2019s lesson.",
      "But I think this instance is very different than what happened with him in LA. He was lying to everybody by omission. He\u2019s kind of doing that again.",
      "Eddie seems to have some patterns here. I think Eddie needs to work on that. Now that I think about it, he sort of lets people believe what they believe.",
      "It's a little bit different here because he was withholding something intentionally in the Kim storyline. Here, it's more that he didn't mean to give the wrong impression, but he's too afraid to correct that mistake.",
      "It means everything. The door is now open for Eddie. Now he just needs to walk through it.",
      "Well it's the very next episode, so I don't necessarily want to spoil it, but Eddie needs to dad up, and that is the story that we tell in the next episode.",
      "Eddie and his relationship with his parents vis-\u00e0-vis Christopher is very much the focus of Eddie's story in the next episode.",
      "The episode is called \"Invisible.\" And the characters feel invisible, and even Hen feels invisible, which is unusual for Hen. But there\u2019s just a really nice story of Hen doing what she does best, which is bonding on a human level with a patient, with a character who's feeling unseen, and she helps him to feel more seen, and it doesn\u2019t quite go as she expects.",
      "I don\u2019t think their dynamic really has changed. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, I\u2019ve been writing these characters the same since Eddie\u2019s introduction, since the beginning of Season Two. And I think they were on good, solid ground when they parted at the end of Episode 10.",
      "What I would say is, there\u2019s a thing that happens in tonight's episode, where Buck has the opportunity to encourage Eddie to come back to LA. Eddie, in a weak moment, or in a vulnerable moment, I should say, when his job situation is not panning out the way he had hoped, suggests that maybe he should just come back and do his old job, because he\u2019s not living with his kid anyway, and he needs to provide for him. And it\u2019s Buck who says, \"You can\u2019t come back.\"",
      "So I think what you see, and it's subtle, is a little growth for Buck. Like this time, he didn\u2019t have to hem and haw, he didn\u2019t have to go adopt an animal. He just said the thing that Eddie needed to hear. And it was at a, you know, not a huge price for Buck, but he really was just thinking about the other person in this instance, and I think that's growth.",
      "It's always a trick, when you're in Season Eight of something, and you're continuously putting your characters in peril, that you do want to feel like there's fallout, that there are stakes, that the things that happen to them matter.",
      "The stakes are very high going forward for the rest of the season. And not just for one character.",
      "I mean I think it would be revisited should the need for the reading of a will arrive.",
      "But you know I'm quite sure Eddie doesn't share every move he makes with his parents. And so I would not assume that they know that at all.",
      "Family, faith and loyalty, I think for both of them."

      "\u201cFull disclosure, I put on a smile a lot of those times because I was struggling a lot in my personal life,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about what I\u2019m capable of handling, and also what you should not handle. That was me saying \u2018bye\u2019 to \u2018The Voice\u2019 and having this big move. I love that family, but I was like, \u2018I\u2019m struggling. I can\u2019t smile anymore.

      "Erickson had only told Hunter early in the competition that she had autism, but then shared it with the group after their moment together. Probst spoke about why he allowed Hunter to break with the usual rules of no contact with an opposing tribe.",
      "\"Normally, when a challenge ends, we keep the tribes separated, but I think everybody here saw that something really powerful was happening,\" Probst said. \"Eva was struggling, emotionally struggling. Clearly there was a connection with a former tribe mate in Joe. I felt it was OK for me to suggest they hug, and I could see everybody agreed.\"",

      "\"Now you got me. I\u2019m a parent, too, and I do see it. Wow, this has never happened. But I see it, too, and it\u2019s why I love \u2018Survivor.\u2019\"",
      "Erickson told People in an interview that it was \"crazy seeing Jeff cry.\"",
      "\"Seeing Jeff get so emotional about the situation and thinking about his own family and his kids, that was the moment when it hit me, that this is a moment that is going to be remembered,\" she said. \"He\u2019s seen so many people and been through so much through all of years of 'Survivor,' and now seeing that this moment broke him, I was like, OK, this is bigger than I can imagine.\u201d",

      "\u201cI said \u2018yes\u2019 before they finished the sentence,\u201d he recalls in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "White died in 2021 at the age of 99. Now, the late actor, known for her roles in \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d is being honored with Forever Stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service starting March 27.",
      "The stamp celebrates White\u2019s decades-long entertainment career and her advocacy for animals, an element subtly woven into Stephanos\u2019s design.",
      "For Stephanos, who has spent decades creating portraits for outlets like Rolling Stone, Mad Magazine, and Sports Illustrated, the Betty White stamp was particularly meaningful. The illustrator learned his conception for the stamp had been approved just days before his mother died.",
      "\u201cThis is now a very, very personal piece for me,\u201c he says. \u201c(My mother) got to see her son do something really cool.\u201d",
      "Stephanos recalls gathering around a television with his family to watch White on TV. His grandmother had also been named Betty, and in her final days, his mother, despite being in poor health, saw the design go viral.",
      "Stephanos recognized something familiar in White\u2019s trademark blend of wit and warmth \u2014 qualities that reminded him of home.",
      "\u201cShe reminded me of my mother. She had this real ability to say something, and then jaws would drop, and people would be like, \u2018Did she really just say that?\u2018\u201c he says. \u201cShe\u2019s one of those people who could get away with things that a lot of people couldn\u2019t because she was an older lady, and she had that sweet smile, and it\u2019s delivery \u2014 it was never mean. It was never mean. It was always good humor, even when she was roasting somebody.\u201d",
      "For the stamp, Stephanos drew inspiration from a portrait of White taken by Kwaku Alston in 2010. Alston\u2019s photograph shows White in the later part of her career, wearing red, eyes bright with her signature spark.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a great photo \u2014\u00a0a sweet spot in her older years,\u201c he says. \u201cI just kind of used that as reference and then kind of changed the colors and tried to make it more handmade than a photo would be.\u201c",
      "Stephanos\u2019 image is a stylized portrait of White dressed in purple instead of red to reflect a deeper part of White\u2019s legacy.",
      "\u201cPurple is the color of protest. She had such a positive personality. She never seemed angry, even though protest is a form of anger,\u201d he says.",
      "Even the earring he chose for White was selected with care.",
      "Stephanos sought a subtle way to reflect Betty White\u2019s animal advocacy in the stamp after her estate requested it be part of the design. One morning, Stephanos noticed his wife\u2019s animal-print dress and shiny earrings. He looked down and realized he had drawn a paw print, and an idea clicked.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, wait a minute. We could just do a paw print earring,\u201d he says.",
      "The small but meaningful detail was ultimately approved and became part of the final stamp, which can be seen on White\u2019s right ear in the portrait.",
      "Stephanos thinks of stamps as \u201clittle pieces of art\u201d that \u201cdress up our correspondence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know when I get something with an interesting stamp, I take a second, I look at it and appreciate it. I think it\u2019s one of the great things that humans have figured out: a way to communicate in this way,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s part of why White\u2019s stamp means so much to him.",
      "\u201cThis is the only stamp I\u2019m going to use for the rest of my life,\u201c he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going to be so obnoxious with this.\u201d",
      "When asked what kind of message he\u2019d send with it, his answer is certain.",
      "\u201cShe was such a positive, funny, witty, bright light,\u201d he says. \u201cI think anything that you want to send with a kind of a positive, happy tone (her stamp) would totally be appropriate.\u201d"

      "Duke University has responded to the latest episode of \"The White Lotus,\" calling the inclusion of a Duke T-shirt on a character who is contemplating suicide and killing members of his own family \"troubling.\"",
      "Frank Tramble, vice president for communications, marketing and public affairs at Duke University, said in a March 27 statement to TODAY.com that the school did not \"approve the use of its marks\" in the hit HBO show.",
      "\u201cDuke appreciates artistic expression and creative storytelling, but characters prominently wearing apparel bearing Duke\u2019s federally registered trademarks creates confusion and mistakenly suggests an endorsement or affiliation where none exists,\" Tramble said.",
      "\u201c'The White Lotus' not only uses our brand without permission, but in our view uses it on imagery that is troubling, does not reflect our values or who we are, and simply goes too far,\" he continued.",
      "Tramble noted that suicide is the second-leading cause of death on college campuses.",
      "\"As imagery from the show is being shared widely across social media, we are using our brand to promote mental health awareness and remind people that help is available,\" Tramble said.",
      "In Episode 6 of the hit HBO show, Jason Isaacs\u2019 character Tim Ratliff wears a Duke T-shirt as he ideates a potential murder-suicide, and vivid depictions of Tim killing himself and shooting other members of his family are shown throughout the episode.",

      "The rivalry between Duke and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a plotline on the show \u2014 Tim and his eldest son, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), both went to Duke, while his wife Victoria (Parker Posey) and their daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), attended Chapel Hill.",
      "And their youngest Ratliff son, Lochlan (Sam Nivola), is deciding between going to Duke and Chapel Hill while they're vacationing at the resort in Thailand.",
      "The reason the family went to Thailand was tied to Piper's studies at UNC as well. She told her family she needed to go to Thailand to complete her thesis at Chapel Hill, though it's later revealed that she actually wants to move to Thailand to study under a monk.",
      "While the family is vacationing, Tim learns he's under investigation for alleged financial crimes back at home \u2014 fueling his desperation on what to do in response."

    "summary": "The true story of Gold & Greed explained. Who was Forrest Fenn? Who found his treasure? What was in his poem? Where was his treasure found?",
    "story": [
      "When art and antiquities dealer Forrest Fenn revealed he had hidden a box of gold, jewels and other precious artifacts somewhere in the wilderness of the American West, he set off a decade-long treasure hunt that drew hundreds of thousands of seekers from around the world.",
      "People scaled mountains, rafted down rivers and trekked through forests in the hopes of discovering Fenn\u2019s secret box of riches, which was said to be worth up to $2 million. The legions of devoted treasure hunters were armed only with clues from a cryptic poem penned by Fenn, as well as other hints he scattered throughout his memoir and press interviews.",
      "Now, five years after the treasure was found, the mania around the quest is the subject of a new Netflix docuseries, \u201cGold & Greed: The Hunt for Fenn\u2019s Treasure.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the largest, biggest modern day treasure hunt of our time,\u201d director Jared McGilliard said in an interview Thursday with NBC News\u2019 Joe Fryer. \u201cIt harkens back to Indiana Jones \u2026 it just felt like a dream story to tell.\u201d",
      "The three-part series explores Forrest Fenn\u2019s motivations for hiding the treasure, and tells the stories of multiple people from all walks of life who sought the treasure for years.",
      "For many seekers, the quest for the treasure was rewarding in itself, McGilliard says.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little overused trope, but the journey is the adventure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt got people outside. It changed their perspective on themselves and their own life and what they can accomplish \u2026 People began to dream again, about how their life could change and on this amazing adventure.\u201d",
      "The series also explores the treasure hunt\u2019s dark side, notably the fact that five people lost their lives in their search for Fenn\u2019s cache of riches.",
      "And, without sharing any spoilers, the docuseries also includes one bombshell twist that suggests the hunt may not be over yet.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the true story behind \u201cGold & Greed,\u201d including who Forrest Fenn was, what his mysterious poem said, and how the treasure was found.",
      "Who was Forrest Fenn and what was his treasure?",
      "Forrest Fenn was an art and antiquities dealer and Vietnam War veteran based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His star-studded client list included Ralph Lauren, Robert Redford and Suzanne Somers, TODAY reported in 2013.",
      "In 1988, Fenn, who was born in 1930, learned he had kidney cancer and was told he had a 20% chance of surviving three more years.",
      "Facing this diagnosis, he pondered how he would be remembered and what he wished to leave behind. Eventually, when thoughts about his mortality \u201chit bottom,\u201d Fenn was struck by an idea.",
      "\u201cIt had been so much fun building my collection over the decades, why not let others come searching for some of it while I\u2019m still here, and maybe continue looking for it after I\u2019m gone?\u201d he wrote in his 2010 memoir, \u201cThe Thrill of the Chase.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I decided to fill a treasure chest with gold and jewels, then secret it \u2014 leaving clues on how to find it for any searcher willing to try,\u201d he continued.",
      "Fenn began filling an antique lock box with a heap of treasures he had accumulated over the years, including gold nuggets, two of which weighed more than a pound, and many other smaller gold pieces and coins, he revealed in his memoir.",
      "The box\u2019s treasures also included ancient Chinese carved jade figures, a Spanish 17th-century gold ring, and an antique gold bracelet set with 254 rubies, six emeralds, two Ceylon sapphires and several small diamonds.",
      "All told, the box contained about 20 troy pounds of gold and was estimated to be worth up to $2 million.",
      "Fenn spent years building the treasure box, and eventually hid it in the Rocky Mountains in around 2010, TODAY reported in 2013.",
      "As suggested by the title of his memoir, Fenn hid the box not only to enrich whoever found it, but to inspire treasure hunters to find intangible rewards in the search itself.",
      "\u201cGet your kids out in the countryside, take them fishing and get them away from their little hand-held machines,\u201d he told TODAY.",
      "In his memoir, he provided some clues as to the location of the treasure, noting it was \u201cin the mountains somewhere north of Santa Fe.\u201d He also said he hid the chest \u201cso it would be difficult to find but not impossible.\u201d",
      "Fenn also wrote a poem, included in his memoir, that he said contained nine clues about the location of the treasure. He noted that some subtle hints about the hidden loot were also scattered throughout his book.",
      "In addition to these clues, he appeared multiple times on TODAY in 2013 to reveal more hints about the location of the treasure. He shared that the treasure was not hidden in Idaho or Utah, nor was it hidden in a graveyard, hidden higher than 5,000 feet above sea level, or \u201cassociated with any structure.\u201d",
      "As interest grew in his hidden bounty, Fenn became an almost cult-like figure to thousands of fortune seekers, who combed through his writings and even used software to analyze his facial expressions in TV interviews to glean hints about the box\u2019s whereabouts, according to the documentary.",
      "Following his 1988 diagnosis, Fenn recovered from cancer. He died in Santa Fe of natural causes at 90 in 2020, the Associated Press reported. He was survived by his wife, Peggy, who died later that year, their two daughters, and multiple grandchildren.",
      "What did Forest Fenn's poem say?",
      "Fenn included a poem in his memoir that contained nine clues, which \"if followed precisely\u201d would lead to the location of his hidden treasure.",
      "\u201cThe clues are in consecutive order. If you want to find the treasure chest, you have my book,\u201d he told Lorena Mills in an interview on Report from Santa Fe in 2011.",
      "He said treasure seekers should begin by reading the book \u201cjust normally,\u201d and then go back and \u201cread the poem six, eight, 10 times, study every line, every word.\u201d",
      "Then, he recommended, \u201cread the book again slowly with the idea of looking for clues or hints that are in the book that will help you follow the clues (in the poem). You can find the chest with just the clues, but there are hints in the book that will help you with the clues.\u201d",
      "The poem reads as follows:",
      "As I have gone alone in there",
      "And with my treasures bold,",
      "I can keep my secret where,",
      "And hint of riches new and old.",
      "Begin it where warm waters halt",
      "And take it in the canyon down,",
      "Not far, but too far to walk.",
      "Put in below the home of Brown.",
      "From there it\u2019s no place for the meek,",
      "The end is drawing ever nigh;",
      "There\u2019ll be no paddle up your creek,",
      "Just heavy loads and water high.",
      "If you\u2019ve been wise and found the blaze,",
      "Look quickly down, your quest to cease,",
      "But tarry scant with marvel gaze,",
      "Just take the chest and go in peace.",
      "So why is it that I must go",
      "And leave my trove for all to seek?",
      "The answer I already know",
      "I\u2019ve done it tired, and now I\u2019m weak.",
      "So hear me all and listen good,",
      "Your effort will be worth the cold.",
      "If you are brave and in the wood",
      "I give you title to the gold.",
      "What happened during the hunt?",
      "Hundreds of thousands of treasure hunters around the world searched for Fenn\u2019s hidden box of riches, with some die-hard seekers devoting years of their lives to the quest.",
      "Fenn communicated regularly with fans, and once estimated he had received 13,000 emails and 18 marriage proposals from treasure seekers, according to journalist Ben Wallace, who wrote an in-depth feature about the quest for New York Magazine in 2020, and was interviewed in the documentary.",
      "The search \u201cgave them meaning in their lives and it led people to give up everything in pursuit of the treasure,\u201d Wallace said in the documentary. \u201cPeople were going through their savings to fund their searches, relationships ending, some people going to prison.\u201d",
      "A psychologist at the University of North Dakota even conducted a study on the Fenn treasure hunters in 2020 and found that 10% of seekers who blogged about their quests \u201cdescribed their involvement as a possible addiction.\u201d",
      "\u201cGold & Greed\u201d follows the stories of several devoted treasure hunters, including Cynthia Meacham, a retiree who trekked around the Rockies for years in search of the riches and developed a close personal relationship with Fenn.",
      "The documentary also chronicles the quest of Chris Hurst, a father who spent years hunting for the treasure in the Wyoming wilderness with his two sons in the hopes of giving his wife an easier retirement. The Hursts sold many of their assets and downsized their home to help fund their quest, Wyoming\u2019s Powell Tribune reported in 2020.",
      "For Justin Posey, another treasure seeker featured in the documentary, the hunt was \"less about the gold.\"",
      "\"It was about solving this puzzle that combined poetry and history and wilderness exploration,\" he told Joe Fryer on NBC News. \"It was just about deciphering the clues. And it almost became like a meditative experience.\"",
      "While Posey didn't find the treasure, he became linked to Fenn's legacy in another surprising way, as revealed in a major twist at the end of the docuseries.",
      "While Fenn\u2019s hidden treasure inspired wonder and an Indiana Jones-like sense of adventure in many searchers, the chase also had a dark side.",
      "At least five people died while seeking the treasure, including Randy Bilyeu, whose body was found near the Rio Grande river months after he went missing while searching for the loot in 2016, according to The Guardian. Another searcher, Paris Wallace, was also found dead along the Rio Grande the following year.",
      "Treasure hunter Jeff Murphy died after falling 500 feet in Yellowstone National Park in 2017, and searcher Eric Ashby drowned while rafting the Arkansas River in Colorado.",
      "A fifth treasure seeker, Michael Wayne Sexson, also died in 2017 after trekking into Dinosaur National Monument along the Utah-Colorado border without adequate clothing or food, according to the Denver Post.",
      "As the potential dangers of the quest became more apparent, Pete Kassetas, the former New Mexico State Police Chief, publicly implored Fenn to call off the search.",
      "\u201cI did not know how to stop this. I wanted to quit sending in people to save the searchers,\u201d Kassetas said in the documentary.",
      "In 2017, Fenn said in a statement that he would not encourage people to stop seeking the treasure.",
      "\u201cI have given a lot of thought about ending the search, but I am not sure what that would accomplish,\u201d the statement read, as shown in the documentary.",
      "Who found Forrest Fenn's treasure?",
      "The search for Fenn\u2019s treasure ended a decade after it began when it was confirmed that Jack Stuef, a then-32-year-old medical student, had found the antique box in Wyoming on June 6, 2020.",
      "\u201cThis treasure hunt was the most frustrating experience of my life,\u201d Stuef wrote in a Medium essay that year. \u201cThere were a few times when I, exhausted, covered in scratches and bites and sweat and pine pitch, and nearing the end of my day\u2019s water supply, sat down on a downed tree and just cried alone in the woods in sheer frustration.\u201d",
      "He did not disclose the exact location of the treasure, although other seekers later used photos to zoom in on the exact place the box had likely been discovered, as shown in the documentary.",
      "Stuef, who described himself as a \u201cmillennial with student loans to pay off,\u201d sold the majority of Fenn\u2019s treasure at auction in 2022.",
      "The final auction brought in about $1.3 million and included more than 400 items, including gold coins and nuggets, gold dust, and precious jewelry, as well as a glass jar holding a scroll apparently printed with a 20,000-word autobiography of Fenn, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "Stuef said he had initially hoped to maintain his anonymity, and said Fenn had been fully supportive of protecting his identity.",
      "\u201cNot because I have anything to hide, but because Forrest and his family endured stalkers, death threats, home invasions, frivolous lawsuits, and a potential kidnapping \u2014 all at the hands of people with delusions related to his treasure,\u201d Stuef wrote in a later Medium essay. \u201cI don\u2019t want those things to happen to me and my family.\u201d",
      "However, Stuef ended up revealing his identity in December 2020 after he learned about what he described as a \u201cmeritless lawsuit\u201d was going to be brought against him by a woman he didn\u2019t know.",
      "\u201cThis would make my name a matter of public record, so I chose to come forward today,\u201d he wrote on Medium.",
      "He called the lawsuit an \u201cabuse of the court system\u201d and maintained he was \u201cthe legitimate finder of the treasure.\u201d",
      "Stuef says he was \u201cthankful\u201d to meet Fenn once before he died, and honored the collector and author\u2019s legacy in an essay after he died in 2020.",
      "\u201cOf course, Forrest\u2019s greatest gift to humanity was his treasure,\u201d Stuef wrote. \u201cSure, it could only be given to one person, the one who found it, but it inspired hope the world over and the joy of discovery for all those who got to go out and appreciate the wonders of the Rockies.\u201d"

      "Since its debut in 2018, \"The Conners\" has provided plenty of laughs and a bit of controversy. In May 2018, ABC canceled the \u201cRoseanne\u201d spinoff after its star Roseanne Barr published racist posts on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "The series was later rebranded as \"The Conners\" and Barr's character was killed off. The matriarch's death plays a focal point in the Season 7 premiere, with her family considering legal action against the pharmaceutical company responsible for her opioid addiction.",
      "Missed the season premiere? We're recapping all the highlights below.",
      "The family considers suing over Roseanne's death",
      "Barr's character previously died of an accidental opioid overdose. In the Season 7 premiere, her sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) learns about a court ruling that would allow the family to sue the drug manufacturer.",
      "Darlene (Sara Gilbert) is encouraged by the news and thinks a financial settlement could give the family a much needed \"safety net.\" However, her father Dan (John Goodman) isn't so keen on the idea and says, \"We'll lose because they've got big, fancy lawyers.\"",
      "Jackie insists that it's still a viable option because there are many lawyers that work for contingency on these cases, meaning they'd only have to pay a lawyer if they win the case.",
      "Still, Dan doesn't think it's worth the hassle and says, \"No amount of money is gonna bring your sister back or your mom.\"",
      "While talking with his wife Louise (Katey Sagal), Dan says he doesn't want to dig up all the pain from Roseanne's death once again, especially since there's no guarantee that they'll win the case.",
      "Louise says he doesn't have to go through with it, but Dan says he feels guilty and basically wants her to force him to do it. However, she says it's not her decision to make.",
      "Later in the episode, Dan and Jackie argue about the case and Jackie questions Dan about how he's changed, saying he used to be someone \"who would never walk away from a fight.\" Jackie says she feels like she needs to start a case and he tells her to do what she has to do.",
      "\"I have the guts to do something you won't,\" she says. \"If you don't hear from me it's because I don't know who are you are anymore, Dan.\"",
      "Tyler and Becky adjust to living together",
      "The season premiere picks up where Season 6 left off, with Tyler (Sean Astin) moving in with Becky (Lecy Goranson) at Darlene's house.",
      "Becky is trying to work on her thesis and finish her master's degree, but Tyler is going above and beyond with romantic gestures and Becky has a hard time focusing while spending so much quality time with her beau.",
      "Becky tells Darlene she doesn't want to burst their \"romantic bubble phase,\" especially since Tyler is \"too sensitive\" for her to tell him to ease up a bit.",
      "One night, Tyler cooks for Becky and she wants to have a little talk\u00a0about their relationship. Lucky for her, he opens up first, saying, \"Showing you how much I love you is ruining my life\" since it's taking up so much time.",
      "Becky plays along, pretending that she's fine with all the romantic gestures but admitting that they could cut back on it.",
      "Ben returns and Darlene feels neglected",
      "After getting a promotion at work, Darlene comes home one day and is psyched that Ben (Jay R. Ferguson) will be returning home after traveling for work.",
      "When he arrives, Darlene shows Ben a makeshift office space she created for him in their house. However, he says he's already rented out an office space.",
      "Darlene soon feels neglected that Ben is spending so much time at work and takes Becky's advice to make more of an effort in their relationship. She shows up at his office one day and asks if Ben wants to go to a bar that night but he says he has to work.",
      "Louise reassures Darlene that this hectic time is just temporary and says work will calm down for Ben soon.",
      "Jackie confronts Mark about his job",
      "Last season, Mark (Ames McNamara) took a job hacking computers to say money for college. As a cover, he told his family he was working for a Fortune 500 company.",
      "In the Season 7 premiere, Jackie begins to wonder how Mark is earning so much money. After doing some sleuthing, she finds a note in his backpack that says he's the \"best hacker ever.\" She confronts him, warning him that he might get hooked on the job.",
      "Mark reassures Jackie that he's going to stop when he has enough money for school, but she's not so sure. Jackie, meanwhile, has been contemplating a return to the police force and lets Mark know his actions could lead him to be on the police's radar."

      "Alvarado Garcia explained that, upon initial examination of the body, authorities found that Miller had vomit in his mouth and nose, leading them to conclude that he had asphyxiated with his own vomit.",
      "Miller's death is also being investigated by the agents of the Quepos and Parrita Subdelegation of the OIJ."

      "In his acting career, Robert DeNiro has portrayed a godfather, an Irishman, and a good fella. Now, he plays a pair of wise guys.",
      "In \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d DeNiro plays not one, but two infamous mobsters: Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, a pair of mafia leaders who grew to power in tandem and became practically destined rivals in the New York City crime scene.",
      "Written by Nicholas Pileggi, author of \u201cWiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family,\u201d the book that inspired the mafia and crime drama standard \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d this Barry Levinson-directed film (director of \u201cRain Man\u201d) is a heavily detailed historical telling of the relationship between Costello and Genovese, including a power struggle and an attempted killing that leave the once close-knit ties between the two mob bosses strained.",
      "Costello, referred to as \u201cking of the rackets\u201d in the film, preferred to do most of his work from behind the scenes. On the other hand, DeNiro\u2019s other role as the Naples-born Vito Genovese is ambitious, power-hungry and in search of being the \u201cboss of bosses\u201d of the mafia, using aggressive tactics to gain power.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d follows the two mafia bosses\u2019 effective rivalry created when Genovese arrives home from Naples after World War II in search of Costello\u2019s position as head boss.",
      "Keep reading for an in-depth look at the depiction of crime bosses Frank Costello and Vito Genovese.",
      "Who were Vito Genovese and Frank Costello?",
      "Vito Genovese and Frank Costello both came to the New York after being born in Italy, then became involved in organized crime.",
      "Vito Genovese was 15 years old when he arrived in New York City from Naples, Italy. His first brush with the law came when he was 19, according to \u201cThe Deadly Don: Vito Genovese\u201d by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anthony M. DeStefano. By the time he was in his 60s, per 1958 letter to the FBI director included in a FOIA request document, he was \u201cwithout a doubt one of the most notorious of the country\u2019s hoodlums.\u201d",
      "Originally named Francesco Castiglia and born in Calabria in 1891, Frank Costello came to Manhattan as a child in 1895. According to the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement, Costello became a member of the Five Points Gang in Manhattan and was jailed for at least four times for assault, robbery and at least four counts of weapons possession between 1908 and 1918.",
      "Costello then became a well-known bootlegger during the Prohibition era. Working alongside other well-known criminals \u2014 most importantly the infamous Charles \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano \u2014 he was associated with Joe Masseria\u2019s bootlegging organization among other ventures throughout the 1920s, per the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement.",
      "In 1931, Luciano established and led the \u201cCommission,\u201d a union of the five most powerful families in the criminal underworld, in the aftermath of the bloody Castellammarese War. Genovese became his underboss, with Costello serving as Genovese\u2019s consigliere.",
      "What was their relationship like?",
      "In \u201cThe Deadly Don: Vito Genovese,\u201d DeStefano lays out Costello and Genovese\u2019s tense relationship and how it came to be that way.",
      "According to DeStefano, the rivalry began when Luciano received a prison sentence for up to 50 years for compulsory prostitution in 1936, and gave the reigns to Costello instead of Genovese.",
      "The book describes Costello as a \u201cmobster-diplomat whose entrenchment with the Democratic party, conciliatory manner, and legitimate interests\u201d made him a good choice for the role. \u201cSo long as Costello was around, Genovese had a sense of inferiority,\u201d the book reads.",
      "But Genovese wasn\u2019t around for long. In 1937, the year after he was naturalized an American citizen, Genovese fled New York because he was named a suspect in the 1934 murder of Ferdinand Boccia.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d picks up in 1945 when Genovese arrived back in New York from Italy, after being indicted in the murder. He was later acquitted due to a lack of evidence from a corroborating witness, the New York Times wrote at the time.",
      "The movie follows Genovese back in New York getting his bearings and working with Costello to get back on the street. Then, Costello got sent away: He was convicted of obstructed and lying to Congress and served 18 months.",
      "While Costello was in prison, Genovese became the top acting boss of the Luciano family",
      "Genovese attempted to maintain control of the Commission even after Costello left prison. He ordered a hit on Costello outside his Central Park West apartment building in 1957.",
      "\"The shooting of Costello only grazed his head, and the old crime boss fully recovered. But Costello got the message, and in a truce with Genovese, he agreed to 'retire' from the mob, leaving leadership of the family in Genovese's hands,\" DeStefano writes.",
      "What happened to Vito Genovese and Frank Costello?",
      "Later in 1957, Genovese and other mafia bosses gathered in the Apalachin, New York home of Joseph Barbara.",
      "According to DeStefano's book, the purpose of the meeting was for Genovese to anoint himself \"as boss of the family.\" Other business included the murder of mafia boss Albert Anastasia, which occurred earlier that year.",
      "Law enforcement broke up the meeting and took over 60 attendees in for questioning. Charges were later dropped, but the meeting \"backfired badly\" for the mobsters, according to DeStefano's book. The meeting also forced FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to acknowledge the mafia publicly for the first time, changing the course of organized crime history.",
      "Genovese later received a 15-year prison sentence for narcotics trafficking and died in prison in 1969.",
      "Costello died of a heart attack at age 82 after living a life out of the public. Costello\u2019s obituary mentioned his interest for gardening in his Long Island home during his life out of the mafia, referenced in the conclusion of the film."

      "King Charles III experienced unspecified side effects of his cancer treatment and was briefly in the hospital on Thursday, Buckingham Palace said.",
      "\"Following scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer this morning, The King experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital,\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.",
      "No details were provided on the length of the observation period nor what the king's side effects entailed. He has since returned to Clarence House, one of the royal residences in London.",
      "The monarch's engagements for Friday have been postponed as a result. Charles was scheduled to have four events in Birmingham that he is \"greatly disappointed\" to have to miss, according to the palace.",
      "\"He very much hopes that they can rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible,\" the palace said.",
      "Buckingham Palace revealed that Charles had been diagnosed with cancer in February 2024, but information on the British royal's condition has been sparse. The announcement came weeks ahead of news that Princess Kate was undergoing \"preventative chemotherapy.\"",
      "The palace has not publicized what type of cancer either royal was diagnosed with nor the stage of the disease. Kate announced her cancer was in remission earlier this year.",
      "A source told NBC News in December that Charles' treatment is \"moving in a positive direction.\" The source said there's been progress in his condition but that treatment would continue into 2025 as the cancer is in a \u201cmanaged condition.\"",
      "Charles became king on Sept. 8, 2022, following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. She was the longest serving monarch in the United Kingdom's history and, subsequently, Charles was the longest-serving heir to the throne before becoming the sovereign."

    "summary": "Oscar winner Hamdan Ballal, his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood said he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers.",
    "story": [
      "Only a few weeks ago, Hamdan Ballal stood on a stage in Los Angeles accepting an Oscar for the film\u00a0\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d\u00a0a documentary depicting his West Bank village\u2019s struggle against Israel\u2019s occupation.",
      "On Tuesday, Ballal \u2014 his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood \u2014 recounted to The Associated Press how he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers the night before. The settler, he said, kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during a settler attack on his village.",
      "The soldiers then detained him and two other Palestinians. Ballal said he was kept blindfolded for more than 20 hours, sitting on the floor under a blasting air conditioner. The soldiers kicked, punched or hit him with a stick whenever they came on their guard shifts, he said. Ballal doesn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but he said he heard them saying his name and the word \u201cOscar.\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d he said in an interview at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims that Ballal was beaten by soldiers. The settler whom Ballal identified as his attacker, Shem Tov Luski \u2014 who has threatened Ballal in the past \u2014 denied he or the soldiers beat him and told the AP that he and other Palestinians in the village had thrown stones at his car. He said he didn\u2019t know Ballal was an Oscar winner.",
      "The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks as well as one Israeli civilian, who was soon released. Ballal denied throwing stones.",
      "\u2018I\u2019m dying\u2019",
      "The attack took place Monday night in the southern West Bank village of Susiya. It\u2019s part of the Masafer Yatta region featured in \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts the Palestinian residents\u2019 attempts to fend off settler attacks and the military\u2019s plans to demolish their homes.",
      "At around sunset, as residents were ending their daylong Ramadan fast, roughly two dozen Jewish settlers along with police entered the village, throwing stones at houses and breaking property, witnesses say. Around 30 soldiers arrived soon after. Jewish Israelis in an activist group supporting the villagers showed video of themselves also being attacked, with settlers hitting their car with sticks and stones.",
      "Ballal said he filmed some of the damage caused by the settlers. Then he went to his own home and locked it, with his wife and three young children inside.",
      "\u201cI told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,\u201d he said.",
      "Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.",
      "Lamia Ballal, the director\u2019s wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d",
      "Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. \u201cHe broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,\u201d he said.",
      "He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal\u2019s house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night\u2019s events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.",
      "On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal\u2019s home, and the family car\u2019s windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.",
      "Under detention",
      "Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.",
      "Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was \u201cfreezing\u201d from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.",
      "The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cAll my body is pain,\u201d he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron.",
      "Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.",
      "Confrontations with settlers",
      "In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight.",
      "\u201cThis is my land, I was given it by God,\u201d Luski says. \u201cNext time it won\u2019t be nice.\u201d He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to\u00a0Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife.",
      "\u201cRape for a higher cause,\u201d he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.",
      "The film \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a\u00a0joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "Settlers have also set up outposts around the area and at times destroy Palestinian property. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually\u00a0turn a blind eye\u00a0or intervene on behalf of the settlers.",
      "The film has drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed\u00a0ending the lease\u00a0of a movie theater that screened it.",
      "Basel Adra, another of the film\u2019s co-directors and a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there\u2019s been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping this.\u201d",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.",
      "The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and\u00a0displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis."

      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.",
      "\u201cLike most politics, this is mostly posturing.\u201d"

According to Russian state news agency TASS, Shoigu said they discussed security issues \u201cin different regions and on the Korean Peninsula in particular.\u201d",
      "Cooperation with North Korea continued even as Moscow and Kyiv agreed on a limited and temporary ceasefire, as the White House made shaky attempts in Saudi Arabia this week to broker a long-term deal.

      "The volume of those weapons is also \u201cexpected to increase depending on battlefield developments,\u201d it added.",
      "North Korea\u2019s troops, widely considered disciplined and trained, nevertheless lack battlefield experience, which experts say is why they have suffered relatively high casualties from drone and artillery attacks.",
      "Still, Pyongyang\u2019s contribution is a further sign of deepening ties with the Kremlin, with which it signed a mutual defense treaty last year, elevating their status to that of formal allies. North Korea has receievd technical assistance from Russia for its satellite program, according to Seoul.",
      "U.S. officials and others say that North Korea may also be receiving support for its growing nuclear ambitions in return for its military support.",

      "It can be hard to describe that feeling of being overcome by the unbearable cuteness of a fluffy little cat or a chubby-cheeked baby. But there\u2019s now an official word for it in English: gigil.",
      "Borrowed from Tagalog, one of the primary languages of the Philippines, gigil is among 42 words that are untranslatable or have no direct English equivalents that have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in March.",
      "Gigil (pronounced \u201cghee-gill\u201d), which the OED says dates to 1990 and is also used in Philippine English, refers to a feeling \u201cso intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is\u202fwe find so adorable,\u201d according to the OED\u2019s latest update.",

      "For example, komorebi is a Japanese word to describe sunlight dappling through leaves, while the Norwegian term utepils means sitting outside enjoying a beer, both of which have no English equivalents but are gaining popularity.",
      "Sometimes, people who speak English alongside other languages use loanwords with \u201cenough frequency\u201d that they eventually become part of the vocabulary of their variety of English, Salazar said.",
      "Aside from gigil, the list includes 10 other loanwords from the Philippines, such as videoke, the Filipino version of karaoke, and terror, a strict, harsh or demanding teacher.Twelve of the new words come from the Philippines\u2019 Southeast Asian neighbors Malaysia and Singapore. Nearly half of them refer to food such as otak-otak, a dish consisting of seafood mixed with spices and coconut milk, and ketupat, a small rice cake boiled in a pouch of woven palm leaves.",
      "The region\u2019s colloquial exclamation alamak, which is used to convey surprise and dismay, is also included in the list, though its exact origin is uncertain.",
      "Of the 11 words borrowed from South Africa, two are expressions that relate to feelings of frustration and anger \u2014 gatvol, a slang term describing a person who feels extremely annoyed, and the hell-in, a colloquial phrase used predicatively to talk about a furious individual.",
      "Irish contributes eight loanwords to the OED update. They include debs, a formal social event for students, and class, a general term of approval that appears in the popular Northern Ireland sitcom \u201cDerry Girls.\u201d",
      "With around 500,000 words and 150 years of history, the OED is widely regarded as the accepted authority on the English language.",
      "OED editors review thousands of word suggestions every year to determine which words to include in updates. The dictionary has a watch list database with contributions from various sources, such as its own reading programs, crowdsourcing appeals, and automated monitoring and analysis of language in use."

Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain as another fire spread closer.",

      "The agency said the test demonstrated the reconnaissance drone\u2019s ability to track multiple targets and monitor troop movements on land and at sea, potentially enhancing North Korea\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations and ability to neutralize enemy threats. The report said the new exploding drones were designed for various attack missions and featured unspecified artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the drones\u2019 performance and approved plans to expand production, emphasizing that drones and AI should be \u201ctop\u201d priorities in efforts to advance his armed forces and adapt them to modern warfare, KCNA said. The agency said the tests took place as Kim visited a drone technology complex and an electronic warfare research group on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "The South Korean Defense Ministry did not immediately comment on the North Korean report.",
      "Kim previously inspected other demonstrations of drones that explode on impact in November and August last year.",
      "North Korea also accused South Korea last year of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North\u2019s capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occurred again. The South Korean military did not confirm whether the North\u2019s claims were true.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have escalated recently as Kim continues to expand his military capabilities, which now include various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.",
      "Kim is also aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine, sending troops and military equipment to support Russia\u2019s efforts. This has raised concerns that he may receive Russian technology transfers in return, further strengthening the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a report Thursday that it believes North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February and has continued supplying ammunition, short-range missiles, self-propelled howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers. The Joint Chiefs assessed that, of the approximately 11,000 North Korean troops sent to fight in the war against Ukraine, around 4,000 have been killed or injured."

    "summary": "Chinese researchers are reporting two new steps in the quest for pig-to-human organ transplants: a successful pig kidney transplant and an experiment with a pig liver.",
    "story": [
      "Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the quest\u00a0for animal-to-human organ transplants\u00a0\u2014 with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too.",
      "A Chinese patient is the\u00a0third\u00a0person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.",
      "Scientists are\u00a0genetically altering pigs\u00a0so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014\u00a0two pig hearts\u00a0and\u00a0two pig kidneys\u00a0\u2014 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2014 an\u00a0Alabama woman\u00a0who received a transplant in November and a\u00a0New Hampshire man\u00a0who received one in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",
      "Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient \u201cis very well\u201d and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang, of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi\u2019an, told reporters in a briefing this week.",
      "Wang, part of the hospital\u2019s xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman who was diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.",
      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",
      "The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.",
      "\u201cWe do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,\u201d Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.",
      "In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of \u201cbridge\u201d support\u00a0by externally attaching a pig liver\u00a0to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.",
      "In China, Wang\u2019s team didn\u2019t remove the deceased person\u2019s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.",
      "That \u201cclouds the picture,\u201d said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn\u2019t involved with the work. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully a first step but it\u2019s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.\u201d",
      "Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome.",
      "According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it\u2019s unclear how that experiment turned out."

    "summary": "A coalition of research institutions is working on the tool to offer users more accurate responses that take into account language variances and culturally specific details.",
    "story": [
      "Latin America has been the cradle of\u00a0now globally popular literary and\u00a0musical genres, staple foods like the potato and\u00a0the inspiration behind the well-known Happy Meal.  It could also become the cradle of a new form of AI.",
      "A coalition of research institutions is working on what they call\u00a0LatAmGPT \u2014  a tool that can take into account the region's language variances, cultural experiences and \u201cidiosyncrasies.\u201d",
      "The aim is to offer users a more faithful peek into and representation of the Americas and the Caribbean than that of large language models (LLMs) that have mostly come from U.S. or\u00a0Chinese\u00a0companies and were largely trained in English.",
      "\u201cWe want to develop our capabilities, find local AI-based solutions and create a better understanding of these tools in Latin America and about Latin America,\u201d said Rodrigo Dur\u00e1n Rojas, director of Chile\u2019s National Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is coordinating the effort.",
      "Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that for general purposes, the project will be hard pressed to compete with \u201cstate of the art models with multimillion budgets,\u201d but that \u201cwhat our model can offer that others don\u2019t is a much richer and representative outlook of Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d its people and its outputs.",
      "For example, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said initial testing has shown LatAmGPT to have far better results when queried about South American history, and that the same is expected for when the LLM is asked to, say, write a poem in the style of local authors or provide an overview of regional education policy.",
      "There are more than 30 institutions involved in developing LatAmGPT from countries across the hemisphere, and collaborators include Latinos in the U.S. such as Freddy Vilches Meneses, an associate professor of Hispanic studies at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon. This,\u00a0he\u00a0said, is in recognition of how \u201cLatino and Latin American experiences are a cultural fellowship that goes beyond geography.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are elements of Latin America in Oregon, in California, in Texas,\" Vilches Meneses said. \"We want to make sure to incorporate that Latino experience as well.\u201d",
      "LatAmGPT, which aims to launch its first publicly available version around June, was announced last month\u00a0on the heels of\u00a0a\u00a0regional\u00a0commitment\u00a0made\u00a0during a\u00a0summit\u00a0on artificial intelligence in Uruguay to focus on \u201cethical, inclusive and beneficial\u201d technological development to \u201cpromote and protect human rights\u201d and explore the best possible public policies for AI governance.",
      "That impulse follows an increasing uptake in the region of technological advances such as the use of drones to monitor deforestation\u00a0in the Amazon rainforest, the development of apps to encourage more people to continue learning\u00a0Indigenous languages, the creation of\u00a0algorithms\u00a0to aid in the search for\u00a0forcibly disappeared\u00a0people or the adoption of\u00a0blockchain mechanisms to preserve historical documents of past dictatorship's actions.",
      "Some of those preserved documents are now being used as sources to train LatAmGPT, along with papers, records and logs that institutions such as libraries and national archives have made available specifically for the project. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said this gives the model more nuance and localized breadth than the general internet data scraping other systems tend to use.",
      "\u201cLatAmGPT will have more context than the other model languages and should therefore hallucinate far less\u201d when it comes to its use cases, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said. Hallucination is what AI researchers call when a model seemingly makes up an answer that's incorrect or\u00a0false though it's presented as factual.",
      "So far the project\u2019s dataset has more than 8 terabytes of information so the model can run on about 55 billion parameters (the variables with which an LLM makes a prediction output, like neurons that synapse or connect in a human brain). Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that\u2019s somewhat close to what the first public version of ChatGPT had when OpenAI launched it in the fall of 2022.",
      "The challenges of diverse dialects and complex grammar",
      "ChatGPT and other models like Google\u2019s Gemini have also sought in recent years to include a wider scope of data to offer the programs in languages other than English and with \u201clocalizations\u201d\u2014 such as the LLM knowing to respond in the metric system when relevant or to understand idioms.",
      "Those companies acknowledge the importance of expanding that offering. HyunJeong Choe, the director of engineering and internationalization for Google\u2019s Gemini Apps, said it\u2019s \u201ca dedicated experience\u201d that can be \u201cessential for cultural relevancy and sensitivity.\u201d",
      "But they also recognize it\u2019s a particularly complex endeavor, since most training data available to them is in English. \u201cThe intricacies of different languages can pose a significant obstacle for all AI models. ... Languages with complex grammar, diverse dialects or limited digital resources may be harder to train,\u201d Choe said.",
      "LatAmGPT,\u00a0through\u00a0its institutional networks\u00a0with libraries and archives, has somewhat skirted this issue \u2014 but not entirely. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said they\u2019re still struggling to incorporate Indigenous languages spoken by millions in the region because written documentation is not as widely available.",
      "But they're still aiming to try as they continuously perfect their model \u2014 though they stress the importance of collaboration.",
      "\u201cThe quality and attributes of the results we can get will depend on us as Latin Americans joining in to contribute as much as we can,\u201d said Vilches Meneses, the Lewis & Clark professor.",
      "Currently, with the tentative June launch date, LatAmGPT is still receiving data as collaborators regularly check in with specific questions to benchmark it in comparison to other available models.",
      "Among the questions they're testing are queries on the many different names and terms used in the region for a specific word like \"car,\" or a request for the GPT to make a comparison chart of how the region's countries have responded to mass immigration from\u00a0places like Venezuela.",
      "A large goal of LatAmGPT is to become familiar with these technological advances so they can be included in public policies and regulations, according to Dur\u00e1n Rojas.",
      "For that, the creation of the transcontinental network to help develop the project is key, and per Dur\u00e1n Rojas will likely remain so.",
      "\u201cThe most meaningful aspect, the greatest legacy, is this interconnectedness we\u2019ve found to strengthen and develop AI-based solutions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe model, I mean it\u2019s great that we\u2019re making it, but the collaboration \u2014 that\u2019s what will most impact how we build things going forward.\u201d",
      "And with that there is a growing opportunity to offer further contributions with a Latino touch.",
      "\u201cAt its base, this is jointly creating something from Latin America for Latin America and for the world, as proof to ourselves and to others that we can also produce high tech,\u201d Vilches Meneses said, \u201cand that we can contribute to knowledge of artificial intelligence while still employing our\u00a0social and cultural intelligence.\u201d",

      "Duonychus, which means \u201ctwo claws\u201d in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones and a long neck ending in a small head, and it was covered in down and quill-like feathers.",
      "\u201cIt kind of blew my mind,\u201d the lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal\u00a0iScience, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, an associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News by email. \u201cI felt this rush of excitement, like, \u2018Wait\u2026 am I actually looking at something completely new here?\u2019\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs were already the \u201cweirdest dinosaurs out there,\u201d Kobayashi said. \u201cDuonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It\u2019s like evolution said, \u2018Let\u2019s try something different,\u2019 and just ran with it.\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period,\u00a0145 million to 66 million years ago.",
      "Despite having only two claws, Duonychus was an \u201ceffective grasper\u201d that could reach branches or swaths of vegetation up to nearly 5 inches in diameter.",
      "\u201cDinosaurs weren\u2019t just stuck in one body plan \u2014 they were constantly experimenting, evolving, doing weird stuff,\u201d Kobayashi added, calling them \u201ctotal oddballs.\u201d",
      "A study co-author, Darla Zelenitsky, an associate professor at the University of Calgary in Canada, described Duonychus' claws as \u201csharp and huge,\u201d about 1 foot long.",
      "Duonychus would have used their claws to grasp and pull vegetation to the mouth during feeding, Zelenitsky said in an email Wednesday, adding that claws could also have had other functions, like self-defense or grappling.",
      "Though Therizinosaurs were part of the theropod group, which included meat-eaters like Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus, Duonychus mainly ate leaves from large shrubs and trees.",
      "The specimen was excavated in 2012 by researchers from the Mongolian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Paleontology\u00a0from the Gobi Desert\u2019s Bayanshiree Formation, which dates back 90 million years and is known for its exceptional diversity of Therizinosaurs.",
      "The fossil was a partial skeleton without a skull and legs, but the hands were \u201cexceptionally preserved,\u201d according to the study. The Duonychus individual was not fully mature.",

      "The number of digits doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to hooking and pulling, Benton said, adding that the third finger may have been an \u201cencumbrance\u201d due to its short length.",
