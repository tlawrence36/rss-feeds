      "Tonia Haddix, 56, was also ordered Thursday to serve three years of supervised release after her 46-month prison sentence ends.",
      "Haddix, who ran a primate facility the St. Louis suburb of Festus, pleaded guilty in March to two counts of perjury and one of obstructing justice.",
      "It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in \u201cconfined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures\u201d at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility.",
      "Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies \u201cBuddy\u201d and \u201cGeorge of the Jungle.\u201d Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie \u201cBuddy\u201d alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved.",
      "Haddix signed a consent decree in 2020 agreeing to send four of the chimps to a Florida sanctuary. The order allowed her to keep three others, including Tonka, at a facility she was to build.",
      "But after a judge found that was not complying with the agreement, authorities arrived in 2021 and removed the remaining chimps, except for Tonka. Haddix claimed Tonka had died and that she had cremated the remains, according to court records.",
      "\u201cI wanted to keep trying to save Tonka if l could. But then he just died on his own, so there was no saving him,\u201d she said, according to court records.",

      "Eddie Palmieri, the pioneering rumba and Latin jazz musician, has died at 88",
      "Eddie Palmieri, the avant-garde musician who was one of the most innovative artists of rumba and Latin jazz, has died. He was 88.",
      "Fania Records announced Palmieri's death Wednesday evening. Palmieri\u2019s daughter Gabriela told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after \u201can extended illness.\u201d",
      "The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums.",
      "Palmieri was born in New York\u2019s Spanish Harlem on December 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle\u2019s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums.",
      "He eventually abandoned the instrument and went back to the playing piano. \u201cI\u2019m a frustrated percussionist, so I take it out on the piano,\u201d the musician once said in his website biography.",
      "His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album \u201cThe Sun of Latin Music,\u201d and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams.",
      "In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: \u201cLearning to play the piano well. ... Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\u201d",
      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed\u2019s band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \u201cV\u00e1monos pa\u2019l monte,\u201d with his brother Charlie as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",
      "Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of \u201cHarlem River Drive,\u201d in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz.",
      "Later, in 1974, he recorded \u201cThe Sun of Latin Music\u201d with a young Lalo Rodr\u00edguez. The album became the first Latin production to win a Grammy.",
      "The following year he recorded the album \u201cEddie Palmieri & Friends in Concert, Live at the University of Puerto Rico,\u201d considered by many fans to be a salsa gem.",

      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",
      "Even in this first outing, his performance drew bravos from the audience and critics.",
      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",
      "Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the opening \u201cRing\u201d installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment he walked onstage, everyone sensed his God-like presence,\u201d Dudamel said in an email to the AP. \u201cWhen he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.\u201d",

      "As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment I became a man, my mom told me: \u2018When you walk in the street, don\u2019t walk too tall. Make yourself small, so you don\u2019t stand out, so you can survive,\u2019\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s extremely hard on himself,\u201d said Gaffigan, who is conducting the Santa Fe performances and recalled the first time he heard from Green after he was cast.",
      "\u201cHe called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,\u201d Gaffigan said, \u201cAnd from the first words on the telephone, he said, \u2018I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?\u2019 \u2026 I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting this time.",

      "Kristin Scott Thomas draws on her own childhood losses for her directorial debut \u201cMy Mother's Wedding.\u201d",
      "Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. Both were Royal Navy pilots who died in crashes. The first happened when she was 5. The second at age 11. Thomas uses these facts, a kind of origin story, as the basis for her directorial debut, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a comedic drama about family, trauma and getting on with it that opens in theaters Friday.",
      "Knowing that the story comes from a real place is important for the experience. It gives \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a perfectly average film that doesn\u2019t quite land the way it should, an emotional depth that it\u2019s otherwise lacking. This is a strange shortcoming considering the caliber of the cast, including Thomas as the bride to be, and Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham and Scarlett Johansson as her daughters. But it\u2019s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren\u2019t guarantees that a movie will work.",
      "In the film, the deaths may be in the distant past, but they continue to haunt Diana\u2019s (Thomas) adult daughters as she prepares to marry another. Diana\u2019s new man is not a dashing pilot, forever preserved in handsome youth. Geoffrey (James Fleet) is very gray. He likes to talk about birds, ospreys in particular, has never had children and comes with a very silly last name (Loveglove) that she plans to take. Her girls are not exactly impressed, though they\u2019ve all got their own stuff to deal with.",
      "It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I\u2019ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she\u2019s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto).",
      "Miller\u2019s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest \u201cDame Of Darkness\u201d is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. And Beecham is the youngest Georgina, a nurse who suspects that her husband is having an affair. To find out, the girls hire a private detective to surveil her house and show them the footage after the wedding.",
      "It's a very busy, fraught weekend for everyone. There\u2019s lots of fretting over why Katherine won\u2019t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. There\u2019s lingering anxiety about their mom marrying this man who seems so unlike the two heroes that came before and much discussion about the importance of last names, marriage and making sure kids feel like they belong to someone. Some things get resolved, but it's hard to shake the feeling that everyone might need a new therapist by the end.",

      "\u201cThe 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents\u2019 generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s,\" she said.",
      "In addition, both experts drew parallels between the political and social dynamics of the two decades, such as technology booms and catastrophic events.",
      "\u201cAt the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cI think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.\u201d",
      "The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said.

      "Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, \u201cWeapons,\" and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If there\u2019s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie \u201cWeapons,\u201d it\u2019s that the best laughs won\u2019t come from the jokes he writes.",
      "The film follows Cregger\u2019s 2022 solo directorial debut \u201cBarbarians,\u201d the widely celebrated genre-bending horror. This time, the young director bends even more, spinning a town into chaos when all children but one from the same classroom mysteriously vanish, leaving a trail of questions in their place.",
      "The Warner Bros. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious \u2014 a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIf the humor is coming from an authentic reaction that a character\u2019s having, then it works,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that didn\u2019t make it into the movie that I thought were going to be so funny. And then we did a test screening, and nobody laughed and I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s gotta go.\u201d",
      "Paranoia runs deep in the film. The town's heartbroken parents are represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Archer, whose son was among the missing. The students\u2019 teacher, played by Julia Garner, is determined to solve the mystery, despite parents blaming her for the disappearances.",
      "The humor here comes naturally, Cregger said, as characters navigate the absurd events happening around them.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not playing for the laugh, otherwise you lose the laugh,\u201d said Brolin, whose character stumbles through his grief, a state ripe for what he called genuine and \u201cembarrassingly funny\u201d moments.",
      "If 17 kids up and ran out of their homes at 2:17 a.m. one morning with no trace, what would a community do? That question drove \u201cWeapons,\u201d painting a picture of a town left reeling by the mystery.",
      "The film setting \u2014 the fictional small town of Maybrook, Illinois \u2014 is just as integral to the plot as any of its main characters. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie\u2019s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are \u201copposite side of the same coin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because this isn\u2019t even like a proper horror film,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it\u2019s kind of its own genre, in a way.\u201d",
      "The town\u2019s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Parents are outraged, storming into town halls and angrily demanding answers from the police, the school and, most pointedly, the students\u2019 teacher. Yet, when Garner\u2019s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage.",

      "\u201cWe definitely have a, \u2018Whoa, not my problem,\u2019 kind of a thing when chaos is occurring, because we see it so much on TV that I think we\u2019re able to just kind of tune it out, even when it\u2019s happening in front of us,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cLiving in America, I\u2019ve seen crazy things happen with my own eyes right in front of me, and I\u2019ve just kept walking for better or worse, so I don\u2019t know, it feels real.\u201d",
      "Brolin \u2014 who's found wide-reaching success across Hollywood, from the 1985 classic, \u201cThe Goonies,\u201d to the Marvel universe \u2014 initially hesitated when approached for the film. As a father of four, facing his worst nightmare \u2014 losing his children \u2014 was \u201cnot something I want to show up to work for,\u201d he said.",
      "But \u201cWeapons\u201d lends the characters a layer of depth that allowed horror, a genre he said is typically treated as cosmetic, to suddenly have \u201cdepth, and humor and absurdity,\u201d which, coupled with his own adult daughter\u2019s love of \u201cBarbarian,\u201d was enough to convince him to sign on.",
      "The movie subtly mocks suburban life, as goriness and horror occur under the sights of nosy neighbors, corrupt police departments and struggling relationships.",
      "Each character that drives the plot forward is just as flawed as they are victims of tragedy. Gandy, the schoolteacher, is harassed by parents for her missing students, but is secretly battling alcoholism. Archer, the heartbroken father, is failing in his job and his marriage as he navigates his son\u2019s absence. Paul Morgan, played by Alden Ehrenreich, is a local beat police officer with secrets of his own.",
      "\u201cEvery character is perceived in a certain way and then every character breaks,\u201d Brolin said. \u201cIt all comes down to this very base thing: What if you lost the thing that you value the most? How do you deal?\u201d",
      "For Ehrenreich, who\u2019s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, \u201cWeapons\u201d offered a different pace, but its horror wasn\u2019t what drew him in. Rather, he was captivated by the film\u2019s depth and weirdness.",
      "\u201cThe weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I\u2019ve read in years,\u201d Ehrenreich said.",

    "summary": "The body-swappers are back",
    "story": [
      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

She\u2019s flirting with Jake (Chad Michael Murray) \u2014 yes, the hunky guy from the original \u2014 and her flirting is so weird, Jake thinks she's having a stroke.",
      "It all barrels toward a conclusion that we won\u2019t spoil. Will the wedding be derailed by the efforts of Lily and Harper? Will that derailment be temporary? Will the sisters-to-be reach an understanding? Will Lohan get to play the electric guitar? Will everyone grow to appreciate each other?",
      "That last question, we can answer. Of course they will. Whoever they are, and whatever they just did.",

      "Kennedy's decision to terminate the projects is the latest in a string of decisions that have put the longtime vaccine critic's doubts about shots into full effect at the nation's health department. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened.",
      "The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1.",
      "\u201cTo replace the troubled mRNA programs, we\u2019re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don\u2019t collapse when viruses mutate,\" Kennedy said in the video.",
      "Infectious disease experts say the mRNA technology used in vaccines is safe, and they credit its development during the first Trump administration with slowing the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Future pandemics, they warned, will be harder to stop without the help of mRNA.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,\u201d said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations.",
      "He noted mRNA technology offers potential advantages of rapid production, crucial in the event of a new pandemic that requires a new vaccine.",
      "The shelving of the mRNA projects is short-sighted as concerns about a bird flu pandemic continue to loom, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cIt's certainly saved millions of lives,\u201d Offit said of the existing mRNA vaccines.",
      "Scientists are using mRNA for more than infectious disease vaccines, with researchers around the world exploring its use for cancer immunotherapies. At the White House earlier this year, billionaire tech entrepreneur Larry Ellison praised mRNA for its potential to treat cancer.",

      "Traditionally, vaccines have required growing pieces of viruses, often in chicken eggs or giant vats of cells, then purifying that material. The mRNA approach starts with a snippet of genetic code that carries instructions for making proteins. Scientists pick the protein to target, inject that blueprint and the body makes just enough to trigger immune protection \u2014 producing its own vaccine dose.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, HHS said \u201cother uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement.\"",
      "The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna, which was studying a combination COVID-19 and flu mRNA shot, had said it believed mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional vaccines.",

He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police.",
      "He accused the football league of hiding the dangers of brain injuries linked to contact sports. Tamura didn\u2019t play professional football but played during his high school years in Southern California, where he grew up.",
      "His mother told the dispatchers on Sept. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for \"depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia.\" She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. It was one of two incidents that led to Tamura being admitted to hospitals for mental health crises.",

      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",

      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",

      "Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don\u2019t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.",

      "Research shows mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.",
      "But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.",
      "That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.",
      "Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to \u201cmake enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology \u201ccould change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins \u2014 often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs \u2014 and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it's ready to fight back.",
      "But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.",
      "The \u201cm\u201d stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.",
      "They take a snippet of that genetic code that carries instructions for making the protein they want the vaccine to target. Injecting that snippet instructs the body to become its own mini-vaccine factory, making enough copies of the protein for the immune system to recognize and react.",
      "Years of research show protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 both the types made with mRNA and a type made with traditional technology \u2014 does wane over time. The vaccinations provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected.",

      "Today's COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.",
      "Osterholm counts about 15 infectious disease vaccines that could benefit from mRNA technology, but that's not the only potential. Many disease therapies take aim at proteins, making mRNA a potential technique for developing new treatments. Researchers already are testing an mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine for pancreatic cancer.

      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",
      "WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.",

      "The oral vaccine \u2013 proven to be safe and effective \u2014 has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no management,\u201d he said, citing a lack of accountability.",
      "Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a \u201cmajor course correction.\u201d John shared the emails with AP and said he\u2019s received no response.",
      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",
      "In Karachi, locals told AP they didn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s fixation on polio and complained of other issues \u2014 dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cPolio eradication has created a monster,\u201d Closser said. It doesn\u2019t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.",

      "Three new studies highlight the severe health impacts of recent wildfires on Maui and in Los Angeles",
      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",

      "The study also found 40% saying their health had declined since the fires, with close to half talking about increased fatigue and weakness, eye irritation and lung-related symptoms.",
      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",
      "The increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.",
      "The third study was led by researchers in Finland. They used mathematical modeling to estimate that there were 440 more deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 than what would normally have been expected, and said those are related to the fires.",

The committee voted 5-4 in favor of the cut.",

      "Australian authorities say the Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral in four decades",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say.",
      "But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths \u2014 caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change \u2014 have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday.",
      "The change underscores a new level of volatility on the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the report said.",
      "Mike Emslie, who heads the tropical marine research agency\u2019s long-term monitoring program, said the live coral cover measured in 2024 was the largest recorded in 39 years of surveys.",
      "The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world\u2019s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said.",
      "\u201cThese are substantial impacts and evidence that the increasing frequency of coral bleaching is really starting to have detrimental effects on the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Emslie said on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhile there\u2019s still a lot of coral cover out there, these are record declines that we have seen in any one year of monitoring,\u201d he added.",
      "Emslie\u2019s agency divides the Great Barrier Reef, which extends 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) along the Queensland state coast, into three similarly-sized regions: northern, central and southern.",
      "Living coral cover shrunk by almost a third in the south in a year, a quarter in the north and by 14% in the central region, the report said.",
      "Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest \u2014 and fourth ever recorded \u2014 mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world\u2019s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s coral reef watch. So far at least 83 countries have been impacted.",
      "This bleaching event started in January 2023 and was declared a global crisis in April 2024. It easily eclipsed the previous biggest global coral bleaching event, from 2014 to 2017, when 68.2% had bleaching from heat stress.",

Australia in March this year started aerial surveys of 281 reefs across the Torres Strait and the entire northern Great Barrier Reef and found widespread coral bleaching. Of the 281 reefs, 78 were more than 30% bleached.",
      "Coral has a hard time thriving and at times even surviving in prolonged hot water. They can survive short bursts, but once certain thresholds of weeks and high temperatures are passed, the coral is bleached, which means it turns white because it expels the algae that live in the tissue and give them their colors. Bleached corals are not dead, but they are weaker and more vulnerable to disease.",
      "Coral reefs often bounce back from these mass global bleaching events, but often they are not as strong as they were before.",
      "Coral reefs are considered a \u201cunique and threatened system\u201d due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018. The world has now warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. That report said \u201ctropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.\u201d",
      "The report said back-to-back big bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef in the mid 2010s \u201csuggest that the research community may have underestimated climate risks for coral reefs.\u201d",

      "N\u00e9lida P\u00e9rez feeds street cats in Old Havana, but Cuba's worsening economic crisis is making it increasingly difficult",
      "HAVANA -- Every afternoon, 81-year-old N\u00e9lida P\u00e9rez begins her familiar walk down the cobblestone streets of Old Havana, a procession of hungry cats trailing close behind her.",
      "For years, P\u00e9rez has taken it upon herself to feed some of the street cats that roam this part of town, which is also one of the most popular tourist spots in the Cuban capital. She once relied on her own food or restaurant donations, but as the island\u2019s economic situation worsened and tourism declined, it has become increasingly difficult to provide for them.",
      "\u201cI have never in my life asked anyone for a plate of food to feed my cats,\" P\u00e9rez told The Associated Press. \"Now I see myself in difficulties because there is no tourism and there is an economic crisis.\u201d",
      "Since 2020, Cuba has faced a worsening economic crisis, driven by COVID-19 shutdowns, stricter U.S. sanctions, and an internal monetary reform that triggered inflation.",
      "Although the government provides vaccines, sterilization and some free clinics, it does not have the means to provide shelter and food for street cats and dogs. While official data is unavailable, activists say that many pet lovers have turned their homes \u2014 even small apartments \u2014 into shelters, but they are struggling to keep up with the demand and provide adequate care.",
      "\u201cThe streets will kill them,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Iglesias, a 51-year-old pharmacist who adopted five dogs and has rescued and found homes for a dozen others. Iglesias explained that the hardest part is getting food. A 20-kilo (44-pound) bag of dog food, which lasts one dog for about 45 days, costs around $80 \u2014 a sum that is out of reach for most. This forces people to feed animals with pig organ meat (offal), chicken parts or mince meat \u2014 which are also not easy to obtain.",
      "On top of that, annual vaccines cost about $20 and a vet visit is another $10, all while the average monthly salary on the island is only about $12.",
      "Experts say that the abandonment of animals in Cuba is a result of several factors, including rising food and medicine prices, the migration of hundreds of thousands of Cubans in the last five years, and a high mortality rate among older adults.",
      "\u201cPeople are more focused on their problems, which are numerous: Cubans don\u2019t have water, they don\u2019t have electricity, and getting food is becoming increasingly difficult,\u201d said Annelie Gonz\u00e1lez, one of the leaders of the Aldameros Project, a cat colony located in a park in Havana\u2019s historic center.",

      "She and a small group of volunteers began feeding 15 cats in Aldameros Park at the beginning of the pandemic. Today, they care for more than 150. Over the years, through their own efforts and some donations, they were able to install water pumps, pens for special cases, and cages for the kittens.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez points to a number that she said reveals the shocking scale of the problem: at the start of the decade, roughly three abandoned cats appeared in the park each week. This year, that figure has soared to 15 per day.",

      "Zelenskyy\u2019s fast-tracking of the law was a step too far, the public concluded.",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly reversed course last month on a law that would have curbed the independence of the country\u2019s anti-corruption watchdogs after widespread protests that threatened the stability of his leadership for the first time since Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "It's unlikely that the damage to the president\u2019s image can be changed as easily.",
      "Zelenskyy's reversal followed years of public discontent that simmered around his inner circle, some of whom have been accused of corruption. But Ukrainians have been largely deferential toward their president in wartime, trusting him to lead the fight against the Kremlin and even acquiescing in the suspension of some civil liberties.",
      "The protests showed the limits of that goodwill after the public concluded that Zelenskyy\u2019s fast-tracking of the law was a step too far.",
      "\u201cPeople will support Zelenskyy in whatever he does as it relates to the war. But the previous level of trust \u201cthat he will carry out everything correctly, without outside interests, has been damaged,\" said Tetiana Shevchuk, a board member of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center, which fights graft. Zelenskyy \"will need to work hard to get it back.\u201d",
      "A Gallup poll released Thursday found that about two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of the way Zelenskyy is handling his job as president, down from 84% in 2022. Another poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found a similar pattern, with trust in Zelenskyy down from just before the war started and a sharp decrease since after the signing of the law.",
      "Both polls were conducted in July and excluded adults living in regions of the country that were not controlled by Ukraine or were under entrenched Russian control.",
      "The initial decision to sign the proposal hurt Zelenskyy's standing among Ukrainians, loyal lawmakers and Western allies, including one foreign minister who told The Associated Press that his willingness to backtrack on the law would help restore \u201clost trust.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy sparked the outcry when he signed measures to reduce the powers of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, or SAPO.",
      "Zelenskyy said the initial bill was meant to root out Russian influence in those agencies, but he did not provide evidence to support the claim. The bill became a law so quickly that lawmakers said they barely had time to read it. For the Ukrainian people, patience wore thin.",
      "From the outset of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, the public tolerated restrictions such as martial law and postponed elections. But critics also argued that the consolidation of the president\u2019s authority undermined the country\u2019s democratic institutions, along with the checks and balances necessary for transparency. Members of Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle and the corruption allegations fueled public resentment.",
      "The resulting anti-corruption protests in July in Kyiv and other cities were among the largest in years, drawing thousands of demonstrators and reflecting widespread public demand for transparency and accountability even during wartime.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not one law that brought people to the streets, but a series of events and mostly an accumulation of feelings and wanting to show the government there are certain red lines,\u201d Shevchuk said.",
      "Ukrainian leaders have been sensitive to public opinion ever since the Euromaidan protests of 2013 and 2014, which ignited extraordinary political changes, including the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych. Those protests marked a decisive moment in Ukraine\u2019s history and galvanized public intolerance toward corruption and abuse of power.",
      "Until recently, Zelenskyy\u2019s decisions and public statements aligned mostly with public opinion. He watches polls closely. For instance, he did not say that Ukraine would be unable to win back occupied territory militarily until polls showed that Ukrainians were willing to end the war for territorial concessions.",
      "Many of the suspicions about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle focused on the head of his presidential office, Andriy Yermak, who is seen as having too much power, according to activists and Ukrainian and Western officials. In recent weeks, two other individuals close to Zelenskyy sparked public ire ahead of the protests.",
      "The first was former Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov, a close ally of Zelenskyy\u2019s, who in June was formally named a suspect in a high-profile land-grab case. Later, the NABU announced that he was the sixth suspect in a large corruption scheme led by a Kyiv property developer.",

It was his decision, and we are team players.\u201d",

      "\u201cProbably there should have been a dialogue. Communication is always necessary,\u201d he told reporters on July 24.",
      "The firm faith in Zelenskyy led one lawmaker to joke that if the president nominated a spoon for prime minister, Parliament would likely vote in favor. But that sentiment has changed, Merezhko said, with parliament now becoming more independent.",
      "\u201cNow members of parliament will be more careful,\u201d he said. \u201cIf before we had a presumption of trust with respect to the president or cabinet of the bills, we now have a presumption of mistrust.

      "Israel says it plans to take over Gaza City",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel said Friday it will intensify its 22-month war with Hamas by taking over Gaza City, drawing a dismissal from the militant group and renewed international calls to end the conflict, while stirring fears for Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. The timing of another major ground operation remains unclear since it will likely hinge on mobilizing thousands of troops and forcibly evacuating civilians, almost certainly exacerbating the humanitarian catastrophe.",
      "Mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework that will include the release of all hostages \u2014 dead and alive \u2014 in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told The Associated Press.",
      "Before Israel's Security Cabinet approved the plan to take over Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had outlined more sweeping plans Thursday in an interview with Fox News, saying Israel planned to take control of all of Gaza. Israel already controls around three-quarters of the territory.",
      "Hamas rejected Israel\u2019s plans in a statement. \u201cExpanding of aggression against our Palestinian people will not be a walk in the park,\u201d the group said.",
      "An expanded offensive could widen discord between Israel and international powers, which have stepped up criticism of the war amid mounting shock over media reports showing starvation.",
      "Britain urged Israel to reconsider, and Germany said it would not authorize the export of military equipment that could be used in Gaza until further notice.",
      "\u201cThe even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved by the Israeli Cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,\u201d Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.",
      "Tensions could rise further if Netanyahu follows through on the more sweeping plans to take control of the entire territory, two decades after Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the strip.",
      "Asked in the interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would \u201ctake control of all of Gaza,\u201d Netanyahu replied: \u201cWe intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there.\u201d He added that Israel did not intend to \u201ckeep it.\u201d",
      "Israel's new plan stopped short of that, and may be aimed in part at pressuring Hamas to accept a ceasefire on Israel's terms.",
      "It may also reflect the reservations of Israel\u2019s military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reportedly warned that expanding operations would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel\u2019s army after nearly two years of regional wars.",
      "The military \u201cwill prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones,\u201d Netanyahu's office said in a statement after the meeting.",
      "Amir Avivi, a retired brigadier general and chairman of Israel\u2019s Defense and Security Forum, estimated it would take less than three months to mobilize some 30,000 troops, evacuate Palestinian civilians and take over Gaza City.",
      "Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 people. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza. Israel believes around 20 of them to be alive.",
      "The efforts for a new ceasefire have the backing of major Arab Gulf monarchies, according to officials who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the discussions. One is involved directly in the deliberations and the second was briefed on the efforts. The monarchies are concerned about further regional destabilization if Israel\u2019s government proceeds with a full reoccupation of Gaza, the officials said.",
      "The yet-to-be finalized framework aims to address the contentious issue of what to do with Hamas\u2019 weapons, with Israel seeking full disarmament and Hamas refusing. The official directly involved in the efforts said discussions are underway about \u201cfreezing arms,\u201d which may involve Hamas retaining but not using its weapons. It also calls for the group to relinquish power in the strip.",

      "Israel has repeatedly bombarded Gaza City and carried out numerous raids there, only to return to neighborhoods again and again as militants regrouped. Today, it is one of the few areas in Gaza that hasn\u2019t been turned into an Israeli buffer zone or placed under evacuation orders.",
      "A major ground operation there could displace tens of thousands of people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the hunger-stricken territory.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many people reside in the city, which was Gaza\u2019s largest before the war. Hundreds of thousands fled under evacuation orders in the opening weeks of the conflict, but many returned during a ceasefire at the start of this year.",

      "The bug has been a key part of Japanese culture from the Heian era classic \u201cThe Tale of Genji\u201d to popular modern-day manga and animation like \u201cMushishi,\u201d featuring insect-like supernatural creatures.",
      "Japanese people appreciate the glitter of fireflies let loose in the garden or the gentle chirping of crickets kept in a little cage. You can feed the bug pets watermelon, but special jelly pet food for bugs is also available at stores. Naturally, bugs are on sale as well, with the more esoteric ones selling for 20,000 yen ($133).",
      "Here, crawly and buzzing critters are not just relegated to the scientific realm of the entomologist working on a taxidermy of pinned butterflies. Celebrities boast about their fascination with bug-hunting as their hobbies just like a Western movie star might talk about his yacht or golf score.",
      "The bug as companion is an essential part of what\u2019s observed, enjoyed and cared for in everyday life, reflecting a deeply rooted celebration of humankind\u2019s oneness with nature.",
      "\u201cThey are so tiny. If you catch and study them, you\u2019re sure to discover something new,\u201d says Munetoshi Maruyama, professor of bioenvironmental sciences at Kyushu University, whose fascination with bugs began as a child, like many Japanese.",
      "\u201cThey are so beautiful in shape and form.\u201d",
      "One thrill that comes from studying insects is discovering a new species, simply because there are more than 1.2 million known kinds of insects, far more than mammals, which translates to a lot of undiscovered ones, said Maruyama, who has discovered 250 new insect species himself and shrugs that off as a relatively small number.",
      "Japan differs from much of the West in encouraging interaction with bugs from childhood, with lots of books written for children, as well as classes and tours.",

      "Nations kicked off a meeting Tuesday in Geneva to try to complete a landmark treaty over 10 days to end the spiraling plastic pollution crisis. The biggest issue is whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic, or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse.

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",
      "A top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country\u2019s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose their long-standing clients.",

      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think choppy waters are ahead because I think they\u2019re going to have some legal challenges.\u201d",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he\u2019s creating, and that\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \u201cThe rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to \u201cfix\u201d the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries.",
      "But they also worry Kennedy\u2019s changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren't connected to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy and other critics believe the program is \u201ctoo miserly in what it considers to be a vaccine injury,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a public health expert at Yale University. \u201cThat\u2019s created great concern that he could expand what\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine groups have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, despite scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don\u2019t cause the condition. Adding autism to the list of injuries covered by the plan \u201cwould dramatically increase the number of compensable cases, potentially bankrupting it,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits.",
      "In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program \u201cbroken\u201d and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of \u201cinefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.\u201d",
      "Kennedy didn\u2019t specify the changes he's seeking. But some of the people he\u2019s enlisted to help have a history of bringing vaccine injury cases.",
      "In June, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $150,000 contract to an Arizona law firm for \u201cexpertise\u201d in the program. The firm\u2019s Andrew Downing, an attorney specializing in vaccine injury cases, was listed in the HHS staff directory for a time.",
      "\u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who is going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,\u201d Kennedy told Tucker Carlson shortly after the award.",
      "Revamping the program would be the latest in a string of decisions that have upended U.S. vaccine policy, including this week's cancellation of research funding for vaccines using mRNA technology.",
      "Downing has had a leading role in lawsuits against Merck alleging injuries from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, including a rare movement disorder.",
      "In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records.",
      "A judge dismissed more than 120 of those cases, citing \u201ca paucity of evidence\" that Gardasil caused patients' problems.",
      "A spokesman for Kennedy declined to comment on Downing\u2019s hiring.",
      "Kennedy himself has been involved in the Gardasil litigation, as both an attorney and consultant.",
      "Before joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to \u201ca nondependent, adult son,\" according to his financial disclosures.",

      "The cap on compensation remains $250,000 for injury or death, the same as in 1986. Similarly, the program still has eight adjudicators, known as special masters, to review all cases before the government. On average, the process takes two to three years.",
      "The fund has paid out $5.4 billion, compensating about 40% of all people who filed claims.",
      "The U.S. has an \u201cethical obligation\u201d to promptly pay those harmed by government-recommended vaccines, says Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.",
      "\u201cPlus, I think it increases trust in the vaccination program if you have quick, generous compensation,\u201d Reiss said.",
      "As health secretary, Kennedy has broad powers to reshape the program.",
      "One approach could be adding new diseases and illnesses to the government table of payable injuries.",
      "In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children\u2019s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link.",
      "Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm \u2014 perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned \u2014 and add the condition to the program.",
      "In response, the federal government might have to increase taxes on vaccines to replenish the compensation fund, which would make the shots more expensive and less accessible.",
      "\u201cThen you will start to watch the vaccine program infrastructure in this country disintegrate until someone steps in,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who has clashed with Kennedy for years.",
      "A recent Senate hearing titled \u201cVoice of the Vaccine Injured\u201d appeared to make the case for expanding the program. Witnesses included two representatives from Children\u2019s Health Defense, the nonprofit group that Kennedy previously chaired and has repeatedly sued the government over vaccines.",
      "The group\u2019s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son\u2019s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.",
      "Another approach would involve removing certain vaccines from the program, making it easier to bring lawsuits against vaccine-makers. Under current law, people claiming injuries from vaccines covered by the program must first pursue a compensation claim before they can sue.",
      "In cases where the science doesn\u2019t support a connection to vaccines, lawyers might be more successful before a jury.",
      "\u201cJury trials take advantage of the fact that most jurors don\u2019t know anything about science or medicine,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThey are not going to be as easily moved by the data.\u201d",
      "Still, attorneys who bring cases before the compensation program say the process has become more burdensome and adversarial over the years.",
      "Even small changes could improve things. For instance, the statute of limitations for claims could be extended beyond the current three years, which lawyers say cuts off many potential clients.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be changes put in place that make the program easier for petitioners to navigate\u201d said Leah Durant, a vaccine injury attorney.",

      "An increase in the tax on university endowments is creating financial challenges for the wealthiest U.S. colleges",
      "A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.",
      "Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.",
      "The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.",
      "A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump's first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities' investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.",
      "The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.",
      "The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.",
      "\u201cThe tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,\u201d said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for \u2014 financial aid.\u201d",
      "The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.",
      "Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.",
      "Some universities are on the edge of the law's parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.",
      "Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.",
      "Despite the colleges' wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re looking for savings wherever possible,\u201d Levine said, which could impact financial aid. \u201cOne of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.\u201d",

      "For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.",
      "In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.",
      "Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.",
      "Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.",
      "No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country's wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.",
      "The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard's research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard's efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.",

      "President Donald Trump's new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have taken effect, the latest chapter in his effort to reshape global trade",
      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries took effect Thursday, the latest chapter in the saga of Trump\u2019s reshaping of global trade. But many questions remain.",
      "Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imports of pharmaceuticals and has ordered a 100% import tax on computer chips. Most U.S. imports of copper, steel and aluminum are subject to a 50% tariff.",
      "There\u2019s still no agreement on what tariffs might apply to products shipped from China. India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia.",
      "Recent data shows uncertainty is clouding the outlook for exporters around the world as a rush to beat the tariffs during a pause for negotiation tapers off. Companies are reporting billions of dollars in higher costs or losses due to the higher import duties.",
      "Global financial markets took Thursday's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian shares and U.S. futures mostly higher.",
      "Here's where things stand in what has proven to be a fast-changing policy landscape.",
      "The tariffs announced on Aug. 1 apply to 66 countries, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. They are a revised version of what Trump called \" reciprocal tariffs,\" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else. That move triggered sell-offs in financial markets and Trump backtracked to allow time for trade talks.",
      "The president has bypassed Congress, which has authority over taxes, by invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency. That's being challenged in court, but the revised tariffs still took effect.",
      "To keep their access to the huge American market, major trading partners have struck deals with Trump. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan.",
      "Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%.",
      "Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office.",
      "\u201cWe were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Hastiadi said. \u201cWe believe we will stay competitive.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl.",
      "Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on \u201cflexible work\u201d \u2014 the gig economy \u2014 for their livelihoods, the government estimates.",
      "India also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict.",

      "So, even though U.S. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump, a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, nearly all of its exports to the U.S. remain duty free.",

      "Similar surveys show a deterioration in manufacturing conditions worldwide, as a boost from \u201cfront loading\u201d export orders to beat higher tariffs faded, S&P Global said. Similar measures for service industries have remained stronger, reflecting more domestic business activity. In Asia, that includes a rebound in tourism across the region.",
      "Corporate bottom lines are also taking a hit. Honda Motor said Wednesday that it estimates the cost from higher tariffs at about $3 billion. Toyota said its quarterly profit plunged 37% and the hit from tariffs was $3 billion.",

      "It\u2019s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual impact on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho.",
      "Exports from a majority of them are getting taxed at 15%. For a handful of countries in Asia, the rate is 19%. Products from the rest are subject to taxes of 20% to 50%.

      "Businesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump's fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June.",
      "Because tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually.",
      "The country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president's earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center",
      "The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.",
      "\"Retailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,\u201d Jonathan Gold, Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects:",
      "Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.",
      "The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.",
      "In the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term shields most of those countries' products from punishing duties.",
      "The president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India's tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration.",
      "Other duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren\u2019t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased.",

      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months",
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar\u2019s Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \u201cfailed to maintain sanitary conditions.\u201d Boar\u2019s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \u201cthoroughly reviewed\u201d the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\u201cThe facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\u201d officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar\u2019s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn\u2019t wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\u201cIf there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\u201d said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \u201cregret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \u201ccomprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\u201d",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\u201cBoar\u2019s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",

      "Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line",
      "NEW YORK -- Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line.",
      "The new company \u2014 which will trade under the \u201cPSKY\u201d ticker on Wall Street \u2014 brings Paramount's legacy Hollywood footprint, major TV networks like CBS and MTV, streaming services and more under the roof of a new power player: billionaire Skydance founder David Ellison.",
      "\u201cToday marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount\u2019s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,\" Ellison, who is now Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, said in a statement. He added that he aims to \u201chonor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content.\"",
      "The merger's close came just two weeks after it received regulatory approval from the Trump administration. While now a done deal, the path towards that approval was far from smooth sailing. Months of scrutiny and turmoil surrounded the transaction \u2014 particularly amid President Donald Trump\u2019s legal battle with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS. With the specter of the Trump administration potentially blocking the hard-fought deal with Skydance, Paramount agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to the president in early July.",
      "Critics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall. Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company\u2019s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives.",
      "When still seeking approval to buy Paramount from the Federal Communication Commission, Skydance management assured regulators that it would carefully watch for any perceived bias at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In filings just last month, the company\u2019s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody \u201ca diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum\u201d \u2014 and also noted that it plans to take a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of CBS to make \u201cany necessary changes.\u201d",
      "By the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to \u201conce-storied\u201d CBS. \u201cAmericans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,\" Carr said.",

      "Carr also pointed to other commitments from Skydance \u2014 including company assurances about ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Paramount. In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to \u201cconfirm the elimination\u201d of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount \u2014 and maintained that Skydance \u201cdoes not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.\u201d",
      "Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration\u2019s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace \u2014 and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced \u201csignificant changes\u201d to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025.",
      "The FCC approved the merger by a 2-1 vote on July 24. The regulator who opposed it, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, expressed disdain for how it all came together \u2014 pointing to \u201cmonths of cowardly capitulation to this administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,\u201d Gomez, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said in a statement. She also said the agency overstepped its authority by \u201cundermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity.\u201d",
      "Paramount's new leaders will be watched particularly closely for how they deal with CBS News, given the $16 million settlement with Trump following his complaint about last fall's \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. And the merger could also have ripple effects across other Paramount properties, including its late night and comedy programming.",
      "When first announcing the deal in July 2024, Ellison also stressed the need to transition into a \u201ctech hybrid\u201d to stay competitive in today\u2019s entertainment landscape. That included plans to \u201crebuild\u201d the Paramount+ streaming service, among wider efforts to expand direct-to-consumer offerings in a world with more entertainment options and shorter attention spans.",

    "story": [
      "A writer from Maine, Sharon Kitchens has turned her passion for Stephen King's books into a published work",
      "NEW YORK -- With deep knowledge of Stephen King's books and curiosity about their inspirations, writer Sharon Kitchens began a journey around Maine. As she learned about the real-life settings and people behind such fiction as \u201cIT\u201d and \u201cSalem's Lot,\u201d she arranged them into an online map and story she called \u201cStephen King's Maine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was amateur hour, in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut after around 27,000 people visited the site one of my friends said to me, \u2018You should do something more with this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Published in 2024, the resulting book-length edition of \u201cStephen King's Maine\u201d is among hundreds released each year by The History Press. Now part of Arcadia Publishing, the 20-year-old imprint is dedicated to regional, statewide and locally focused works, found for sale in bookstores, museums, hotels and other tourist destinations. The mission of The History Press is to explore and unearth \u201cthe story of America, one town or community at a time.\u201d",
      "The King book stands out if only for its focus on an international celebrity. Most History Press releases arise out of more obscure passions and expertise, whether Michael C. Gabriele's \u201cThe History of Diners in New Jersey,\u201d Thomas Dresser's \u201cAfrican Americans of Martha's Vineyard\u201d or Clem C. Pellett's \u201cMurder on Montana's Hi-Line,\u201d the author's probe into the fatal shooting of his grandfather.",
      "Like Kitchens, History Press authors tend to be regional or local specialists \u2014 history lovers, academics, retirees and hobbyists. Kitchens' background includes writing movie press releases, blogging for the Portland Press Herald and contributing to the Huffington Post. Pellett is a onetime surgeon who was so compelled by his grandfather's murder that he switched careers and became a private investigator. In Boulder, Colorado, Nancy K. Williams is a self-described \u201cWestern history writer\u201d whose books include \u201cBuffalo Soldiers on the Colorado Frontier\u201d and \u201cHaunted Hotels of Southern Colorado.\u201d",
      "The History Press publishes highly specific works such as Jerry Harrington's tribute to a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor from the 1930s, \u201cCrusading Iowa Journalist Verne Marshall.\u201d It also issues various series, notably \u201cHaunted\u201d guides that publishing director Kate Jenkins calls a \u201chighly localized version\u201d of the ghost story genre. History Press has long recruited potential authors through a team of field representatives, but now writers such as Kitchens are as likely to be brought to the publisher's attention through a national network of writers who have worked with it before.",
      "\u201cOur ideal author isn\u2019t someone with national reach,\u201d Jenkins says, \u201cbut someone who\u2019s a member of their community, whether that\u2019s an ethnic community or a local community, and is passionate about preserving that community\u2019s history. We\u2019re the partners who help make that history accessible to a wide audience.\u201d",
      "The History Press is a prolific, low-cost operation. The books tend to be brief \u2014 under 200 pages \u2014 and illustrated with photos drawn from local archives or taken by the authors themselves. The print runs are small, and authors are usually paid through royalties from sales rather than advances up front. History Press books rarely are major hits, but they can still attract substantial attention for works tailored to specific areas, and they tend to keep selling over time. Editions selling 15,000 copies or more include \u201cLong-Ago Stories of the Eastern Cherokee,\u201d by Lloyd Arneach, Alphonso Brown's \u201cA Gullah Guide to Charleston\u201d and Gayle Soucek's \u201cMarshall Field's,\u201d a tribute to the Chicago department store.",
      "The King guide, which has sold around 8,500 copies so far, received an unexpected lift \u2014 an endorsement by its subject, who was shown the book at Maine's Bridgton Books and posted an Instagram of himself giving it a thumbs-up.",
      "\u201cI was genuinely shocked in the best possible way,\u201d Kitchens says, adding that she saw the book as a kind of thank-you note to King. \u201cEvery choice I made while writing the book, I made with him in mind.\u201d",
      "History Press authors say they like the chance to tell stories that they believe haven\u2019t been heard, or were told incorrectly.",

      "Even if these fears may sound exaggerated at first, they aren't unfounded. Workers at one of Germany's biggest kebab factories are locked in a bitter and ongoing fight with their employer over wages and working conditions.",

      "Their current salaries vary widely, and haven't been disclosed. The Food, Beverages and Catering Union that represents them says that payment methods are nontransparent and workers are making vastly different salaries for the same kind of job, according to German news agency dpa.",
      "Workers are also trying to organize a collective contract agreement for all employees with the help of the union.",

      "The workers chop up the meat, marinate it and push chunks of the raw produce on long metal skewers. The meat is then shock-frozen and and delivered to restaurants all over the country.",

      "A new federal report finds that most Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods",
      "Most Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, those super-tasty, energy-dense foods typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, according to a new federal report.",
      "Nutrition research has shown for years that ultra-processed foods make up a big chunk of the U.S. diet, especially for kids and teens.",
      "For the first time, however, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed those high levels of consumption, using dietary data collected from August 2021 to August 2023.",
      "The report comes amid growing scrutiny of such foods by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who blames them for causing chronic disease.",
      "\u201cWe are poisoning ourselves and it's coming principally from these ultra-processed foods,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News earlier this year.",
      "Overall, about 55% of total calories consumed by Americans age 1 and older came from ultra-processed foods during that period, according to the report. For adults, ultra-processed foods made up about 53% of total calories consumed, but for kids through age 18, it was nearly 62%.",
      "The top sources included burgers and sandwiches, sweet baked goods, savory snacks, pizza and sweetened drinks.",
      "Young children consumed fewer calories from ultra-processed foods than older kids, the report found. Adults 60 and older consumed fewer calories from those sources than younger adults. Low-income adults consumed more ultra-processed foods than those with higher incomes.",
      "The results were not surprising, said co-author Anne Williams, a CDC nutrition expert.",
      "What was surprising was that consumption of ultra-processed foods appeared to dip slightly over the past decade. Among adults, total calories from those sources fell from about 56% in 2013-2014 and from nearly 66% for kids in 2017-2018.",
      "Williams said she couldn't speculate about the reason for the decline or whether consumption of less processed foods increased.",
      "But Andrea Deierlein, a nutrition expert at New York University who was not involved in the research, suggested that there may be greater awareness of the potential harms of ultra-processed foods.",

      "\u201cPeople are trying, at least in some populations, to decrease their intakes of these foods,\u201d she said.",
      "Concern over ultra-processed foods' health effects has been growing for years, but finding solutions has been difficult. Many studies have linked them to obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but they haven't been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems.",
      "One small but influential study found that even when diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and micronutrients, people consumed more calories and gained more weight when they ate ultra-processed foods than when they ate minimally processed foods.",
      "Research published this week in the journal Nature found that participants in a clinical trial lost twice as much weight when they ate minimally processed foods \u2014 such as pasta, chicken, fruits and vegetables \u2014 than ultra-processed foods, even those matched for nutrition components and considered healthy, such as ready-to-heat frozen meals, protein bars and shakes.",
      "Part of the problem is simply defining ultra-processed foods.",
      "The new CDC report used the most common definition based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo. Such foods tend to be \u201chyperpalatable, energy-dense, low in dietary fiber and contain little or no whole foods, while having high amounts of salt, sweeteners and unhealthy fats,\u201d the CDC report said.",
      "U.S. health officials recently said there are concerns over whether current definitions \u201caccurately capture\u201d the range of foods that may affect health. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department recently issued a request for information to develop a new, uniform definition of ultra-processed foods for products in the U.S. food supply.",
      "In the meantime, Americans should try to reduce ultra-processed foods in their daily diets, Deierlein said.

      "A new wave of gymnasts are ready to step into the spotlight at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- There was a time, not that long ago really, when Joscelyn Roberson would combat the nerves that inevitably popped up before a major gymnastics meet by reminding herself of one very simple fact.",
      "\u201cI could be like, \u2018Oh no one\u2019s watching me,\u2019\u201d the 19-year-old said with a laugh. \u201cLike they\u2019re watching Simone (Biles). They\u2019re watching Jordan (Chiles). They\u2019re watching Suni (Lee) and Jade (Carey). Like, they are not watching me.\u201d",
      "Well, they are now.",
      "Biles, Lee, Carey and Carey are all on sabbatical from elite gymnastics, perhaps for good. And when Roberson salutes the judges during the first night of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships on Friday, the world championship gold medalist and Olympic alternate will be one of the few athletes on the floor with experience on the sport's biggest stage.",
      "\u201cMaybe they are kind of watching me (now), so it adds a different level of nerves, but I love it,\u201d Roberson said.",
      "Good thing, because she'll probably have to get used to it. Not just for Roberson, but the athletes who will find the spotlight pointing their way now that the icons who commanded it so completely have stepped aside, at least for now.",
      "A year after sending the oldest team in modern Olympic history to Paris, the average age of the competitors who will spend the weekend at Smoothie King Center taking their first tentative steps toward the 2028 Los Angeles Games is under 18.",
      "Hezley Rivera helped the Americans capture gold last summer. Now, the 17-year-old finds herself thrust into the role as one of the standardbearers for one of the marquee programs of the U.S. Olympic movement, and the external pressure that comes along with it.",
      "\u201cI definitely know that people have certain expectations, but I don\u2019t really care what people have, like, expectations-wise for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what I want and my goals, so it\u2019s kind of just focusing on what I\u2019m doing in the gym and what I am doing on the competition floor.\u201d",
      "Rivera's elite 2025 debut was bumpy. She tied for 12th at the U.S. Classic last month, well behind WOGA club teammate Claire Pease, who showed uncommon poise in her first major competition at the senior level.",
      "Yes, it wasn't the meet Rivera wanted, but the reality is the year following an Olympics is all about adjusting to the sport's updated Code of Points and plotting out what the run-up to the next Olympics might look like.",
      "That's perhaps even more true this time around, not just on the floor but off it. While a new wave of athletes who grew up idolizing Biles and Lee step towards the forefront, the organization they will represent is undergoing a significant change of its own.",
      "Li Li Leung, who nimbly guided USA Gymnastics out of the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, is stepping down at the end of the year. During her final \u201cState of the Sport\u201d address on Wednesday, Leung grew uncharacteristically emotional during what she called a \u201cbittersweet\u201d milestone.",
      "Asked if she's had any second thoughts since announcing her plan in June, Leung shook her head.",

      "Much of the groundwork has already been laid.",
      "While the organization is certainly on much stronger footing \u2014 earlier this week USA Gymnastics and NBC Sports announced they were extending their partnership through 2032, and the high-profile corporate sponsors who bailed in the aftermath of Nassar have returned \u2014 Leung stressed the job she and the rest of an organization that was in tatters when she arrived in early 2019 is hardly finished.",
      "\u201cThe transformation of USA Gymnastics and its culture is not over, it will never be over,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 attitude at USA Gymnastics. Instead, we will always be looking at how to build on what we have achieved.\u201d",
      "That remains true on the floor as well. The faces that defined the U.S.'s lengthy run of dominance \u2014 Biles most of all \u2014 are taking a well-deserved break. And while the lure of performing in a hometown Games three summers from now may eventually prod some of them back, this year will be about getting a feel for the next generation.",
      "\u201cI really look at this as a rebuilding year and it's a year of opportunity,\u201d women's program technical lead Chellsie Memmel said. \u201cMost of our Olympians haven\u2019t returned. And then the few we have are still very young. So it\u2019s really about building an opportunity for the younger ones.\u201d",

The road back from the torn right Achilles she suffered on the eve of the 2024 Olympic Trials hasn't been easy. Yet she's at a point where she can compete safely on uneven bars and balance beam. While there was a part of her that wanted to give all four events a shot, she also understands there's no rush.",
      "Back when Blakely was 13, she figured she'd be done as an elite by 20. She pointed to Biles' history-making performance last summer at 27 as proof that \u201cold\u201d isn't what it used to be.",
      "\u201cYour end is what you make it, it\u2019s not what everybody else says it is,\" she said. \u201cI say I might not go for another 10 years, but to be completely honest, I don\u2019t know what these next 10 years will look like for me at all, because I didn\u2019t even think I\u2019d still be doing elite at 20, and here we are.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is excited to play with the starters in the preseason opener against the Arizona Cardinals",
      "ST. JOSEPH, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is glad that coach Andy Reid is sending him onto the field with the rest of their starters when Kansas City visits the Arizona Cardinals for their preseason opener Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI don't necessarily look forward to getting hit,\u201d Mahomes added with a smile Thursday.",
      "Getting hit is exactly why some teams have eschewed playing starters at all in the preseason. When coaches finally decided it wasn't worth the risk to their most valuable players, they began sitting them for one or two games, and last year, teams such as the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles sat them for the entirety of their exhibition slate.",
      "That has never been Reid's preference, though. Nor has it been that of Mahomes, who believes it does him some good to get hit \u2014 once, at least \u2014 so that he can get into the right mindset for the rest of the preseason and ultimately the regular season.",
      "\u201cThere's always a little shock,\u201d Mahomes said.",
      "Now, don't get any misconceptions. The Chiefs might only have those starters on the field for a single series in Arizona, especially if it goes well. But the plan, at least after their final practice before their opener, was that each quarterback will get a full quarter \u2014 Mahomes the first, Gardner Minshew the second, Bailey Zappe the third and Chris Oladokun the fourth.",
      "The rest of the offense would presumably follow suit.",
      "There are certainly things that the three-time defending AFC champions want to see out of their preseason opener. Tops on the list is their new-look offense line, where first-round pick Josh Simmons has already turned some heads as the new left tackle and Kingsley Suamataia has the inside track on replacing two-time All-Pro Joe Thuney at left guard.",
      "The Chiefs have invested heavily in their offensive line, both in draft capital and financial resources, over the past couple years, and the need to upgrade the left side in particular became evident in their Super Bowl loss in February.",
      "There is also some competition for the final spots at wide receiver, and some different names could get some extended looks with the first-team offense. That's because Rashee Rice is sidelined with a groin injury and Marquise Brown with an ailing ankle.",
      "\u201cI think (my advice) is go out there and do what they're doing this camp,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt's going to be a bigger stage going up against another team, but I think Coach Reid prepares us better than anybody else in the league to go out there and play your best football. We practice hard and we practice fast so when it gets to the game, it's not that huge step up.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing for our team this year, honestly,\" Gannon explained. \"We are at a good point with our health, we\u2019re at a good point with our development, and I think this year with our team it\u2019s the best thing to do for our guys.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen I had that winning moment and seeing so many people standing up and cheering for me, it was kind of a surreal experience,\u201d said Mboko, who was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Congolese parents and grew up in Toronto. \"I would have never thought something like this would have came so suddenly. It just proves that your dreams are closer than they (seem).\u201d",
      "The crowd was so rowdy, the umpire repeatedly asked fans to \u201cplease be quiet during the points.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible week here in Montreal,\u201d Mboko told the fans. \u201cMontreal, je vous aime!\u201d",
      "After the match, when the crowd applauded Osaka with some yelling mixed in, she said, \u201cThanks, I guess,\u201d and did not congratulate Mboko. Osaka later declined to speak to the media.",
      "There were 13 service breaks in 25 games, with Mboko converting eight of nine break points. And she did it with a stiff and swollen wrist that was \u201chard to move.\u201d",
      "After falling hard early Wednesday in the third set in the semifinals, Mboko woke up Thursday morning and rushed to the hospital for X-rays and an MRI, but ultimately received the green light to play.",
      "\u201cToday was such an eventful day actually,\u201d said Mboko, who often shook her wrist in visible discomfort. \u201cIt feels unbelievable right now. I mean, words cannot really describe how today went.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some moments where it was aggravating me a lot, but I feel like it was the final. I just kept saying to myself, \u2018You have one more to go.\u2019\u201d",

      "It made that more than a proclamation Friday, announcing it has signed Mazzulla to a multi-year contract extension. Length and details of the new deal were not released.",
      "In a statement, Mazzulla called his new pact with the team \u201ca blessing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would not be here without my faith, my wife, and my children,\u201d Mazzulla said. \u201cWe are thankful for the partnership with our ownership groups, Brad\u2019s mentorship, and the support of our staff. Most importantly, I am grateful for the players I have been able to coach the past three seasons. I look forward to competing for the Celtics and the city of Boston.\u201d",
      "Mazzulla, 37, is coming off his third season as Boston\u2019s coach and has guided the team to the playoffs each season, including the franchise\u2019s 18th NBA title to cap the 2023-24 season. He was the youngest head coach to win the NBA Finals since the 1968-69 season, when 35-year-old Bill Russell led the Celtics to the championship as a player-coach.",
      "Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have won at least 57 games each of those seasons and topped 60 victories in each of the last two.",
      "Though Stevens has never publicly discussed the details of Mazzulla\u2019s contract, the coach was initially given an extension shortly after having the interim tag lifted in February 2023. Stevens confirmed in June that Mazzulla had received at least one additional extension prior to his latest one.",

      "Stephen Nedoroscik, known as \"Pommel Horse Guy,\" remains dedicated to gymnastics despite his newfound fame",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The glasses haven't gone anywhere. And they aren't going anywhere. The same goes for Stephen Nedoroscik's hair, which remains a bit of a floppy, curly brown mess.",
      "Nor, insists the gymnast who became forever known as \u201cPommel Horse Guy\u201d after winning a pair of bronze medals in Paris, has his devotion to the discipline that made him one of the breakout stars of the 2024 Olympics faded in the least.",
      "While Nedoroscik leaned into the fame, most notably a long run on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d last fall, followed immediately by a stint co-hosting the show's national tour, he never once considered putting away his grips for good and trying to go Hollywood full-time.",
      "Sorry, that was never the point of all this.",
      "Three months ago, Nedoroscik walked back through the doors of EVO Gymnastics in Florida and quietly went back to work. And when the U.S. Championships begin on Thursday night, he'll hop onto the event that, at 26, he remains in some ways obsessed with after all these years and begin again.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, I am a gymnast and I blew up for being a gymnast,\u201d Nedoroscik said. \u201cAnd I have sort of a mindset where I don\u2019t really want to be famous. I get, like, anxiety. So it\u2019s like I kind of accept the fact that having this moment was amazing, but eventually that wave will end.\u201d",
      "In a way, Nedoroscik hopped off before he had a chance to be pushed. He's well aware of the tropes of all the teen movies where the main character starts off as an outcast of sorts, then one flash of talent, one splash of popularity, and one makeover montage later, they emerge as a different person.",
      "He had no interest in sticking to that script, though the lure is certainly intoxicating.",
      "When he drilled his dismount at Bercy Arena during the men's team final last July to clinch the biggest international medal by the U.S. men's gymnastics program since the 2008 Olympics, he didn't think it would lead to a spot on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d with host Jimmy Fallon rapping a song on how to spell his name.",
      "The only contestant in \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d two-decade run to incorporate a pommel horse into a dance routine didn't imagine being a fixture on national television for two months either. Yet that happened too. Quickly followed by weeks crisscrossing the country as one of the faces of the show's annual tour.",
      "While he appreciated the support, the messages to his Instagram account that cut through the noise the most weren't the ones talking about the way he navigated a ballroom floor, but from mothers who saw Nedoroscik and his American teammates triumph in Paris and decided it was time to sign their sons up for a sport that always seems to be fighting for its survival.",

When Malone responded \u201cdisgusting\" in the kind of good-naturedly sarcastic tone that has been the love language of guys everywhere for eons, Nedoroscik's laugh echoed throughout the room.",
      "It's one of the many reasons Nedoroscik is happy to be back to what passes for his normal. He understands competing just three months after returning to training might be asking a bit much of his body. The early weeks in the gym were humbling and eye-opening. Yet interspersed with the aches and pains were the occasional reminders that yeah, he's still pretty good at this.",
      "How good? Well, that's one of the reasons the Worcester, Massachusetts, native is already pointing toward the 2028 Games in Los Angeles. There's a chance his best gymnastics might still be ahead of him.",

      "President Donald Trump's plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners \u2014 boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications.",
      "The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device \u2014 from an iPhone to a car \u2014 were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country.",
      "\"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that companies that \"made a commitment to build\" in the U.S. would be spared the import tax, even if they are not yet producing those chips in American factories.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u201cBut if you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge.\u201d",
      "Wall Street investors interpreted that as good news not just for U.S. companies like AMD, Intel and Nvidia, but also for the biggest Asian chipmakers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that have been working to build U.S. factories.",

      "The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There\u2019s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that\u2019s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.",
      "Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.",

      "Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.",
      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

      "At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.",

She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",
      "John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.",
      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to really think about, \u2018Can I revive this research?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cCan I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?\u201d",
      "The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.",
      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",
      "Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have \u201creally gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d",

      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,\u201d Quackenbush said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.\u201d",

In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others.",
      "\u201cA really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience \u2014 not something that helps them with their mental health care,\u201d said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues \u2014 including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request.",

The photos had been automatically deleted from the students\u2019 Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. District officials said they later adjusted the software's settings to reduce false alerts.",

      "Roblox, the online gaming platform wildly popular with children and teenagers, is rolling out an open-source version of an artificial intelligence system it says can help preemptively detect predatory language in game chats.",
      "The move comes as the company faces lawsuits and criticism accusing it of not doing enough to protect children from predators. For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it \u201ceasy prey for pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that \u201cno system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.\u201d",
      "The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. The company is now in the process of open-sourcing it so other platforms can use it too.",
      "Preemptively detecting possible dangers to kids can be tricky for AI systems \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 because conversations can seem innocuous at first. Questions like \u201chow old are you?\u201d or \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d wouldn't necessarily raise red flags on their own, but when put in context over the course of a longer conversation, they can take on a different meaning.",
      "Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though \u2014 as with most moderation rules \u2014 people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards.",
      "It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",

      "Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox \u2014 about 6 billion messages per day \u2014 and analyzes them for potential harms. To do this, Roblox says it developed two indexes \u2014 one made up of benign messages and, the other, chats that were determined to contain child endangerment violations. Roblox says this lets the system recognize harmful patterns that go beyond simply flagging certain words or phrases, taking the entire conversation into context.",
      "\u201cThat index gets better as we detect more bad actors, we just continuously update that index. Then we have another sample of what does a normal, regular user do?\" said Naren Koneru, vice president of engineering for trust and safety at Roblox.",

      "New research from a watchdog group reveals ChatGPT can provide harmful advice to teens",
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to test the guardrails,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \u201cThe visceral initial response is, \u2018Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.\u2019 The rails are completely ineffective. They\u2019re barely there \u2014 if anything, a fig leaf.\u201d",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \u201cidentify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on \u201cgetting these kinds of scenarios right\u201d with tools to \u201cbetter detect signs of mental or emotional distress\" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior.",
      "The study published Wednesday comes as more people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship.",
      "About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world\u2019s population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,\" Ahmed said. \"And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \u201cfor a presentation\u201d or a friend.",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \u201cemotional overreliance\u201d on the technology, describing it as a \u201creally common thing\u201d with young people.",
      "\u201cPeople rely on ChatGPT too much,\u201d Altman said at a conference. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who just say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that\u2019s going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I\u2019m gonna do whatever it says.\u2019 That feels really bad to me.\u201d",
      "Altman said the company is \u201ctrying to understand what to do about it.\u201d",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",

      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\u201cWrite a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\u201d asked a researcher. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \u201cemotionally exposed\u201d while \u201cstill respecting the community's coded language.\u201d",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT\u2019s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person\u2019s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It\u2019s a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \u201cfundamentally designed to feel human,\u201d said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",

      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it\u2019s not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\u201cI'm 50kg and a boy,\u201d said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \u201cUltimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\u201d that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\u201cWhat it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, \u2018Chug, chug, chug, chug,\u2019\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say \u2018no\u2019 \u2014 that doesn\u2019t always enable and say \u2018yes.\u2019 This is a friend that betrays you.\u201d",

      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",
      "\u201cTiempos de vacas flacas\" \u2014 times of the lean cows \u2014 as he calls them.",
      "\u201cAt least it lets us continue\u201d ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.",
      "Even as ranchers in Sonora intensify their efforts to make sure the parasitic fly never makes it into their state, they\u2019ve had to seek new markets.",
      "In the past two months, they\u2019ve sold more than 35,000 mature cows within Mexico at a significant loss.",

      "That\u2019s hard to stomach when beef prices in the U.S. are rising.",
      "The U.S. first suspended cattle imports last November. Since then, more than 2,258 cases of screwworm have been identified in Mexico. Treatment requires a mix of manually removing the maggots, healing the lesions on the cows and using anti-parasite medicine.",
      "Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as \u201cmeat boutiques.\"",
      "There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. feedlots. The switch is not easy.",
      "With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn\u2019t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S.",
      "The recent two-year drought reduced his cattle stocks and forced him to take on debt to save the small family ranch that has survived for three generations.",
      "Juan Carlos Anaya, director of Agricultural Markets Consulting Group, attributed a 2% drop in Mexico\u2019s cattle inventory last year to the drought.",
      "Anaya said Mexican ranchers who export are trying to get the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, \u201cbut the damage is already done.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it\u2019s a question of time before he says: \u2018you know what, this is as far as I go.\u2019\u201d",

      "Sea stars \u2013 often known as starfish \u2013 typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",

      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",

      "Austin Robert Drummond, 28, appeared by a video feed from jail before a judge in Tiptonville, two days after he was arrested in the killings that set the mostly rural region of western Tennessee on edge.",
      "At the hearing, District Attorney Danny Goodman told the judge that the state intends to seek the death penalty. Lake County General Sessions Judge Andrew T. Cook ordered Drummond held without bond because it a capital case.",
      "Drummond was wearing a black and white striped jumpsuit and seated in a chair. He told a judge he operated a business and he said he wants a speedy trial in the case. The judge entered a guilty plea on his behalf because a lawyer had not been appointed yet.",
      "The judge then ruled him indigent and granted a court-appointed attorney.",

      "The ordeal began after an infant in a car seat was found in a front yard in the Tigrett area, roughly 40 miles (65 kilometers) from Tiptonville.

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",

      "Import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs, and Trump announced 100% tariffs on computer chips. That could leave the U.S. economy in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impact.",
      "The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also under challenge. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority.",
      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think choppy waters are ahead because I think they\u2019re going to have some legal challenges.\u201d",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",
      "Global financial markets took Thursday\u2019s tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher.",
      "Brzeski warned: \u201cWhile financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let\u2019s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.\u201d",
      "As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he\u2019s creating, and that\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \u201cThe rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\u201d",

      "A bull moose whose lingering presence around an Adirondack mountain hiking trail this summer forced its closure was euthanized after showing signs of severely deteriorating health, environmental officials said Thursday.",
      "The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest had been temporarily closed since June 6 after the oddly behaving moose began staying on or around the trail near the summit.

They determined euthanasia to be the most humane course of action, given the animal's condition and low likelihood of survival, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation.",
      "\"While we never take such actions lightly, humane euthanasia is sometimes the most responsible course of action.

      "The meeting comes as the United Kingdom tries to come to favorable terms for steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. as the two sides work out details of a broader trade deal announced at the end of June.

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment.",
      "Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until January 31, 2026.",
      "The appointment is Trump\u2019s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him \u201ca stubborn MORON\u201d last week on social media.",
      "Miran has been a major defender of Trump\u2019s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Trump\u2019s tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.",
      "The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.",

      "At its most recent meeting last week Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Trump in his first term.",
      "Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.",
      "After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\u201d Miran said on MSNBC. \u201cAnd the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president\u2019s view.\u201d",

At the time, the U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest.

      "A federal grand jury has indicted a former Georgia sheriff's sergeant on civil rights charges",
      "SAVANNAH -- A federal grand jury indicted a former southeast Georgia sheriff's sergeant Thursday on civil rights charges, accusing him of using excessive force multiple times and writing misleading reports to justify his behavior.",
      "The 13-count indictment charges former Camden County Sheriff's Office Staff Sgt. Buck William Aldridge, 42, with falsifying records and violating the rights of four people he arrested with excessive force.",
      "Aldridge resigned Thursday after the Camden County Sheriff\u2019s Office asked him to step down, sheriff\u2019s spokesman Dalton Vurnakes said.",
      "Aldridge fatally shot 53-year old Leonard Cure, a Black man, in October 2023, The Associated Press previously reported. The indictment does not mention Cure.",
      "District Attorney Keith Higgins in February declined to charge Aldridge for fatally shooting Cure, saying body-camera video and other evidence indicated it was reasonable for Aldridge to use deadly force.",
      "The Cure family filed a federal lawsuit in 2024 against Aldridge and former Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor in U.S. District Court, seeking $16 million.",
      "\u201cI think it helps our case tremendously considering it shows he had this propensity for excessive use of force and a propensity to lie about it on his reports,\u201d Harry Daniels, the family\u2019s lawyer, said of the indictment.",
      "The indictment accuses Aldridge of unjustifiably tasing and kicking someone in January 2021, injuring them. In August 2021, it says, he unjustifiably tased a second victim in the in the back and compressed their neck using the pistol grip of a taser while they were handcuffed, also injuring them, and unjustifiably tased a victim in the back of the head in August 2023.",
      "The indictment also says Aldridge unjustifiably tased and hurt a victim during a June 2022 arrest and punched them in the face, which was previously reported by the AP.",
      "Aldridge left out details of his violent conduct in reports, the indictment says, including that he kicked a victim and punched another. The indictment says Aldridge tried to \u201ccover up\u201d that he struck a victim in the back of the head with a taser. He also falsely wrote that a victim ignored verbal commands and falsely reported that during the August 2021 occurrence, the victim ran away and he tried to use other force to control them before deploying a taser.",
      "Aldridge reported that on Aug. 31, 2021, he was dispatched to a pickup truck that had been in a wreck on Interstate 95, and witnesses had reported seeing it weaving in the road, according to records previously obtained by the AP. His incident report said the driver had methamphetamine.",
      "Aldridge wrote that at one point that the driver appeared to put something in his mouth and began to run.",
      "\u201cHe started pulling away from me saying he did not have anything. I cycled my Taser using the drive stun function into Mr. (name redacted)\u2019s back. Mr. (redacted) dropped to the ground and became compliant. He later stated he ate two 5 mg hydrocodone, which he had hidden in his sock. Mr. (redacted) began defecating on himself.\u201d",

      "A shooting at Fort Stewart on Wednesday has injured five people and raised concerns about safety on military bases",
      "A shooting that injured five soldiers at one of the country's largest military bases on Wednesday has resurfaced questions about a long-standing army policy that largely prevents service members from carrying personal weapons on military installations.",
      "Soldiers in the area who witnessed the shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia \u201cimmediately and without hesitation\u201d tackled the shooter to subdue him before law enforcement arrived, Brigadier Gen. John Lubas said at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "But they didn't have firearms to shoot back because of a policy first enacted decades ago to ensure safety by limiting armed members on army bases to military police. The suspect in the shooting, logistics Sgt. Quornelius Radford, used a personal weapon, Lubas said.",
      "Questions about why soldiers didn't have weapons were buzzing online after at least one video of the incident on social media appears to show service members in uniform running to safety amid a lockdown that lasted about an hour, instead of firing back at the shooter.",
      "While some have questioned why many service members in the area during the shooting didn\u2019t use weapons to defend themselves, others have questioned whether existing regulations do enough to prevent shootings on bases. The shooting is the latest in a growing list of violent incidents at American military installations over the years \u2014 some claiming upward of a dozen lives.",
      "Experts say that there are reasons for long-standing regulations on military bases, despite their limitations.",
      "Department of Defense policy prohibits military personnel from carrying personal weapons on base without permission from a senior commander, and there is a strict protocol for how the firearm must be stored.",
      "Typically, military personnel must officially check their guns out of secure storage to go to on-base hunting areas or shooting ranges, and then check all firearms back in promptly after its sanctioned use. Military police are often the only armed personnel on base, outside of shooting ranges, hunting areas or in training, where soldiers can wield their service weapons without ammunition.",
      "The federal policy leaves little room for local commanders to use discretion about how the policy is enforced. That means the regulation applies even in Georgia, a state with some of the most lax gun regulations in the country, where Fort Stewart is located.",
      "Robert Capovilla, a founding partner for one of the largest military law firms in the country, strongly believes in the Second Amendment. But he said that the strict firearm policies on military bases exist for a reason.",
      "\u201cA lot of these installations are involved in top-secret operations, dealing with top-secret information, and because of that you need a heightened security,\" said Capovilla, a former military prosecutor and defense attorney. \u201cYou simply don't want folks walking around a federal installation with personal weapons.\u201d",

He added that he doesn't believe Wednesday's shooting could have been prevented if military personnel had been armed at the time.",
      "Firearms on military bases are more regulated than most states in some ways, according to former military prosecutor and defense counsel Eric Carpenter. But he said that the limitations on gun control on military bases parallel gun policy debates in the public more broadly.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t forfeit all of your rights when you enter the military,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cOutside of a military situation, the service member has just as much Second Amendment right as anyone else.\u201d",
      "For example, it could be fairly straightforward for a service member living off-base to bring a weapon onto the military installation, Carpenter said, because a senior commander can't regulate gun ownership off base.",
      "There is also scant legal ground for leadership to confiscate a gun when a service member is exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis or post-traumatic stress disorder, potentially posing a threat to themselves or others. In recent years, those gaps have come under more scrutiny because of mass shootings, he said.",

Blues legends B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and John Lee Hooker. And jazz greats Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie and Herbie Hancock.",
      "This year, the New Haven institution is celebrating 50 years in business. And the people who made it happen are reflecting on Toad's success in attracting so many top acts to a venue with a standing-only capacity of about 1,000.",
      "\u201cYou know, I thought it would be good for a few years and then I\u2019d be out doing something else,\u201d said owner Brian Phelps, 71, who started as the club\u2019s manager in 1976. \u201cAnd then the thing started to happen when some of the big bands started to come here.\u201d",
      "Original owner Mike Spoerndle initially opened Toad\u2019s Place in January 1975 as a French restaurant with two friends he later bought out. Before that, the building had been a burger and sandwich joint.",
      "But when the restaurant got off to a slow start, Spoerndle had an idea for bringing in more customers, especially students: music, dancing and beer. A Tuesday night promotion with bands and 25-cent brews helped turn the tide.",
      "Among the acts who performed was New Haven-born Michael Bolotin, who would change his name to Michael Bolton and go on to become a Grammy-winning ballad writer and singer.",
      "The gregarious and charismatic Spoerndle, who died in 2011, endeared himself to bands and customers. A local musician he tapped as Toad's booking agent used his connections to bring in area bands and, later, major blues acts.",
      "Then, in 1977, came a crucial moment. Spoerndle met and befriended concert promoter Jim Koplik, who would bring in many big names to Toad's over the years, and still does today.",
      "\u201cMike knew how to make a really great room and Brian knew how to really run a great room,\u201d said Koplik, now president of Live Nation for Connecticut and upstate New York.",

      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order mandating a probe into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and certain industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies, invoking the vast powers to go after entities that the Republican president alleges have discriminated against him and his allies.",
      "The executive order deals with an issue known as \u201cdebanking,\u201d which is when banks close accounts of individuals or declines to go into business with certain industries. Trump has accused JPMorgan and Bank of America of debanking him and his companies in the past, something both banks have denied.",
      "Trump ordered federal bank regulators to make sure banks do not discriminate against individuals or companies for their political or religious beliefs. He also ordered bank regulators to probe when banks may have allegedly discriminated and refer the cases to the Department of Justice within 120 days of the signing of the order.",
      "The move could open banks to potential civil or criminal investigations, fines or punishments.",
      "When Trump and his party discuss debanking, they typically refer to banks closing the accounts of a person or company when they no longer want to do business with them. Banks usually say they close accounts or deny loans because the person or business is deemed too risky. The banking industry has long argued that it has a constitutional right to choose whom they go into business with, if it does not violate laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.",
      "Th act, which was part of several pieces of legislation signed during the Civil Rights Movement, bans banks from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex and other protected statuses.",
      "Another type of debanking is when government regulators tell banks to avoid doing business with industries or individuals. Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Justice told banks to avoid doing business with \u201chigh risk\u201d industries, which included payday lenders and firearms manufacturers.",
      "This type of government-directed debanking is also known as reputational risk, where the historic reputation of an industry prompts banks to be more careful about banking and lending. Historic examples include entities who did business in high-risk countries, did business largely in cash or were repeatedly flagged by bank regulators.",
      "Banks, who have benefited from Trumps deregulation agenda, have tried to strike a cordial tone with the administration, showing themselves as willing brokers who got caught up in a difficult political environment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in banks\u2019 best interest to take deposits, lend to and support as many customers as possible. Unfortunately, regulatory overreach, supervisory discretion and a maze of obscure rules have stood in the way as the (executive order) makes clear,\u201d the major bank lobby groups said Thursday in a joint statement.",
      "Conservatives have argued that reputational risk has become an umbrella term that allows banks to discriminate. The banking industry insists it does not actively debank and does not target specific industries or individuals. Banks have already been removing any mention of reputational risk from their policies and procedures, particularly since Trump returned to the White House.",

      "\u201cThey totally discriminate against ... me maybe even more, but they discriminated against many conservatives,\u201d he said to CNBC.",

      "The Obama administration's government-directed debanking has been a rallying cry for conservatives. It\u2019s one reason why the cryptocurrency industry backed Trump in 2024. While the Biden administration did not explicitly force banks to debank the crypto industry, Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s bank regulators did express some public concern about it, a move that was read by banks as a reason to steer away from crypto. That phrasing by the Biden administration was often referred to as \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0\u201d by Trump and his allies.",
      "Republicans have introduced legislation to cut down on alleged acts of debanking as well. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has introduced legislation that would require bank regulators to no longer consider reputational risk as a factor in how they measure a bank\u2019s health and risk profile.",

      "After criticizing the Kennedy Center's artistic fare and its finances, President Trump earlier this year named himself as its chairman, longtime aide and supporter Richard Grenell as its president and several White House officials and Trump allies as board members. That triggered a number of artists to cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",

    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",

In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",

The Trump administration has aimed to dramatically trim the agency's workforce.",

After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:53:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists caution new tariffs could pose economic risks, but the White House says growth is rebounding amid low inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Some economists are cautioning that President Trump's sweeping new tariffs on U.S. trade partners, which took effect Thursday, increase the risks that the U.S. economy could enter a period of stagflation.",
      "A mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation,\" the term describes periods marked by high prices and low GDP growth, such as the economic doldrums of the 1970s. To be sure, U.S. economic growth, though\u00a0slower so far this year than in 2024, remains relatively strong, and inflation remains far below its post-pandemic spike.",
      "But economists are flagging the potential for fresh tariffs, which\u00a0took effect Aug. 7,to fuel higher prices as businesses pass on the costs of the new import duties to consumers. With the latest round of import duties, the effective average tariff rate now stands at 18%, the highest since 1934, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Inflation likely rose 2.8% on an annual basis in July, inching higher from the 2.7% annual rate notched in the prior month, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. July data for the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Aug. 12.",
      "\"The stagflation theme in markets is intensifying,\" Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a research note Thursday.",
      "While prices likely crept higher last month, they're still nowhere near the post-pandemic price spike that financially hobbled many households. Yet an increase would represent a reversal of a downward trend earlier this year, and push the inflation rate farther from the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "The economy could face another hit from tariffs if some U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the import duties to the federal government, scale back hiring or expansion plans to cope with those higher costs, economists added. Last week's disappointing employment report suggested the U.S. job market is starting to wobble from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs, they noted.",
      "\"To offset internal costs, you may look at reducing your workforce and curbing wage growth to offset part of the cost of goods increase,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "U.S. GDP is also forecast to slow throughout 2025, with economists polled by FactSet pegging this year's growth at 1.5%, down from 2.4% in 2024.",
      "The White House took issue with concerns raised by some economists about the potential for stagflation. \"Inflation continuing to remain cool and growth rebounding in Q2 both suggest stagflation is simply the latest buzzword for panican paranoia,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Panican\" is a term coined by Mr. Trump earlier this year to refer to the fears expressed by some critics about his tariffs.",
      "A challenging scenario",
      "The U.S. economy is facing a challenging scenario from the combination of a weaker job market and higher inflation, Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a monetary policy research institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The U.S. economy appears to be hitting a mild form of stagflation,\" Amarnath said. \"I'd call it stagflation lite.\"",
      "The dangers of higher inflation and a weaker job market were highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month when he discussed the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Powell pointed out that job creation has slowed, adding risks to the labor market, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual goal.",
      "The Fed has a dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low. Achieving those goals requires different strategies, however. Because high interest rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, the Fed tends to hike rates to fight inflation.",
      "But when unemployment spikes, the Fed typically cuts its benchmark rate to make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage businesses to hire and expand.",
      "\"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" Powell said at a July 30 press conference.",
      "He added that the Fed is \"trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation because you're being pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in.\"",
      "With the job market now showing signs of stress, the challenge is whether the Fed should cut rates, or hold off because inflation remains higher than the central bank's goal \u2014 and is projected to inch higher, Slok noted.",
      "The manufacturing, retail, wholesale and construction industries, which are sensitive to the impact of tariffs, all notched fewer job gains than were initially reported, with the July jobs report's revisions. Manufacturing jobs declined for three consecutive months from May through July, the data shows.",
      "\"That's consistent with a level of uncertainty on the trade side depressing the willingness to hire,\" Amarnath said.",
      "At the same time, \"goods prices have picked up speed,\" he added. \"Household supplies and furniture, apparel and used cars are all starting to see upward momentum, and I think tariffs are an obvious reason for that.\"",

      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",

Overseeing the opening is The Brand House Collective, formerly known as Kirkland's, which manages a portfolio of retail stores including Beyond Inc.'s Bed Bath & Beyond Home, Bed Bath & Beyond, Buy Buy Baby and Overstock.",
      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Brand House Collective\u00a0announced the opening of the Nashville store late last month.",
      "\"We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today,\" Amy Sullivan, CEO of The Brand House Collective, said at the time.",
      "To lure former customers back in the door, Brand House said it would honor legacy Bed Bath & Beyond coupons \u2014 the big white and blue paper slips that have long been associated with the company.",
      "\"The coupon we all know and love is back and for those who need one, a fresh version will be waiting at the door,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "Asked whether Brand House plans to open more stores under the Bed Bath & Beyond Home moniker, Hudgens said, \"We are opening four additional Bed Bath and Beyond Home stores in the Nashville market and will be in an aggressive learn and react posture to determine appropriate merchandising, brand, and strategy shifts to make as we plan our opening strategy for 2026.\"",
      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com. In 2024, Overstock.com made a bid to\u00a0sell Bed Bath & Beyond products at over 100 of its Container Store locations in an effort to revive the struggling retail chain with the help of the Bed Bath & Beyond name.",
      "With the\u00a0opening of the Bed Bath & Beyond Home store in Tennessee, Brand House Collective is taking a major step is resurrecting its troubled retail brands, according to John Bringardner, executive editor at Debtwire, an analytics platform that tracks companies in debt.",
      "\"The company has undertaken a massive turnaround effort, closing underperforming store locations, reducing excess inventory and creating a fresh new look and marketing plan,\" Bringardner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But its underlying financials remain deeply troubled and the success of the relaunch will be an uphill battle.\"",
      "Bed Bath & Beyond opened as a privately held business in 1971 and went public in 1992. It once had thousands of stores globally, according to data from\u00a0Statista.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:28:22 -0400",
    "summary": "An EPA proposal seeks to revoke a key emissions finding which experts say would remove pressure on auto makers to produce EVs.",
    "story": [
      "A new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal\u00a0to revoke a landmark greenhouse gas finding could alter the direction of the auto industry, which until now has had to abide by strict emissions guidelines.",
      "The EPA on July 29\u00a0announced it is planning\u00a0to revoke an \"endangerment finding\" from 2009 that has served as the legal and scientific basis for the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple industries, including motor vehicles, power plants, oil and gas producers and aircraft. The proposal, which still needs to go through a public comment period, focuses on regulations affecting the auto industry. If passed, it would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.",
      "\"With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for auto makers and American consumers,\" Lee Zeldin, the administrator of EPA, stated in the\u00a0announcement.",
      "Strict\u00a0standards for emissions and fuel efficiency introduced during the Obama administration and expanded during the Biden administration, which also provided\u00a0generous EV funding, has led many auto makers to add electric vehicles to their fleets in recent years. Others, like\u00a0Volvo, have taken things a step further and committed to a fully electric future. But the landscape is shifting under President Trump, who has pushed forward a deregulatory agenda.",
      "Experts say that if this proposal passes, it will ease pressure on auto makers to produce electric cars, enabling them to adapt their mix of EV and gas-powered vehicle offerings to meet consumer demand.",
      "\"It gives auto makers a little bit better ability to build, to produce and put vehicles on market that are more closely aligned with the pace of electric adoption right now,\" said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global.",
      "John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents\u00a0most of the major car manufacturers in the U.S., said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the trade association is reviewing the announcement.",
      "\"At the same time,\" he added, \"there's no question the vehicle emissions regulations finalized under the previous administration aren't achievable and should be revised to reflect current market conditions, to keep the auto industry in America competitive, and to keep the industry on a path of vehicle choice and lower emissions.\"",
      "A spokesperson from the EPA said Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks and that the agency's proposal to revoke the endangerment finding \"does not prohibit vehicle manufacturers from developing EVs or different vehicles.\"",
      "Focus on consumer demand",
      "Experts say that even amid a shifting regulatory landscape, consumer preference will continue to drive auto makers' decisions.",
      "\"Their focus is going to be on making vehicles more affordable and dealing with the fact that consumers, not the government, are standing in the way of the mass adoption for EVs,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group.",
      "The rate of electric vehicle adoption has been steady over the last several years, although the majority of Americans still fuel their cars at the pump. Demand for the vehicles has waned over the last year, according to data on light vehicle registration from S&P Global Mobility. From January to May, the electric vehicle market share was 7.3%, compared with 8% for the entire year of 2024, data from the auto intelligence provider shows.",
      "But while consumer demand may have stalled slightly over the past year, auto makers will still want to offer low-emissions products in order to stay competitive both at home and abroad, Ivan Drury, director of insights at online car marketplace Edmunds, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Every auto maker is a global competitor, and even though they might not be selling as well here, they could sell elsewhere better,\" he said.",
      "Impact would take time",
      "Experts say the proposal, if passed, wouldn't drastically change any near-term plans of auto makers, given the time and money they have already invested in their product lines.",
      "\"If had already planned to build X number of this kind of vehicle, you can change that, but not necessarily tomorrow,\" said Brinley. \"So that's gonna have to be planned out.\"",
      "Product development cycles at car manufacturers span five to 10 years, according to a report from Eurasia Group, a global research firm.",
      "The exact strategy and speed with which companies make changes would vary from auto maker to auto maker, according to experts. \"For now, auto makers would enjoy the flexibility and lower costs from less stringent emissions limits, particularly in their nonelectric fleet planning,\" the report from Eurasia says.",
      "There are concerns among some companies that the EPA's proposal, if passed, would inject a degree of chaos into industry, David Victor, a professor at University of California San Diego, told CBS MoneyWatch. Also, the rule-making process will likely be challenged in the courts, he said.",
      "\"[Auto makers] will not get a reliable new set of rules anytime soon,\" said Victor.",
      "The EPA is\u00a0holding\u00a0a virtual public hearing on the proposed rule on Aug. 19-20, with a public comment period open through Sept. 15.",

      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",

    "summary": "Profit hits and price hikes are already coming down the pike as a result of new U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which\u00a0went into effect on Thursday, are likely to have a negative effect on companies' bottom lines and cause consumer prices to rise, trade experts say.",
      "With the new duties on imports from dozens of U.S. trade partners now in place, Mr. Trump's foreign trade policy is expected to lead to even more dramatic cost increases for American companies and consumers, according to economists.",
      "\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.",
      "\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"",
      "That could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.",
      "To date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.",
      "In addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at\u00a0more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue\u00a0rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.",
      "Profit dips",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"",
      "Companies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.",
      "On Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.",

      "For example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of\u00a0higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.",

      "Currently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing. He has also tried to assure the public that foreign producers will pay for the import taxes and has told retailers and automakers\u00a0to absorb the additional expenses.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new executive order signed by President Trump, workers could add higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies to their 401(k)s.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets.",
      "The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete.",
      "But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans.",
      "At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "\"It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,\" said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. \"As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.\"",
      "The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions.",
      "Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers.",
      "\"We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products,\" TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Changing the 401(k) rules",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \"extreme care\" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",
      "Crypto investors",
      "Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash.",
      "Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a \"dream\" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets.",
      "Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve's board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment.",
      "Mr. Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "\"Stephen has a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, and served with distinction in my First Administration,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote on Truth Social. \"He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled \u2014 He will do an outstanding job.\"",
      "The appointment is the president's first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Mr. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him \"a stubborn MORON\" last week on social media.",
      "Miran has been a major defender of Mr. Trump's income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Mr. Trump's tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.",
      "The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.",
      "Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank's interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies.",
      "Miran's nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell's view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves.",
      "At its most recent meeting last week Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.",
      "After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Mr. Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.",
      "\"What we're seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\" Miran said on MSNBC. \"And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president's view.\""

    "summary": "Florida Power & Light is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years.",
    "story": [
      "Florida's biggest utility company is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years, which environmental advocates say would represent the largest utility hike in U.S. history.",
      "Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of Florida-based energy company NextEra Energy, outlined the changes in a petition filed in February with the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's electric industry. According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by approximately $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",
      "In her\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0testimony for the company, FPL senior director of financial forecasting Ina Laney said Lawton's analysis was \"fundamentally flawed and misleading,\" and that it \"fails to recognize the significant customer benefits derived from FPL's financial strategy.\"",
      "Added Laney, \"FPL consistently achieves industry-leading performance in service reliability and cost management.\"",

    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said the significant downward revisions to the monthly jobs numbers could point to an economic shift.",
    "story": [
      "A Federal Reserve official on Wednesday called last week's\u00a0tepid jobs report \"concerning,\" and said its significant downward revisions could signal an economic shift in the U.S.",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook highlighted the report's sizable downward revisions to jobs created in May and June, saying that they are \"typical of turning points\" in the economy.",
      "Friday's report showed that employers added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, also sharply revised its job estimates for May and June, saying that the U.S. added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.",
      "After Friday's report, President Trump fired the BLS commissioner of labor statistics, claiming that the revisions undermined the data's accuracy. He added that \"Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP'.\"",
      "Revisions are a common feature of the monthly jobs reports from the BLS, which updates its data after receiving new information from businesses and other sources. Some economists said the July jobs report reflected that some companies are scaling back hiring plans amid a slowing U.S. economy and uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"There were two major revisions to May and June, and these revisions are somewhat typical of turning points, which again speak to uncertainty,\" Cook said during a Wednesday\u00a0discussion with other Fed officials on the global economic outlook.",
      "She later added, \"When we get the GDP numbers later this year, we're going to see, I can imagine, lower activity.\"",
      "Crafting effective economic policies is dependent on understanding where the economy is heading, said Cook, who prior to her appointment in 2022 as a Fed governor was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, according to her biography.",
      "\"We want to know not just where we've been, but where we're going. So if we're at an inflection point, we want to look at data that speak to inflection points,\" she added.",
      "Other Fed officials said the July jobs report may not necessarily reflect a long-term direction. On Friday, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he had questions about whether the report was a one-time issue or a trend, and added that he believes the labor market still has \"a lot of strength.\"",
      "The downward revision to May and June's hiring data marked the largest two-month downward revision outside of a recession since 1968, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.",
      "Cook also discussed what she referred to as an \"uncertainty tax\" that she said is weighing on businesses across industries. She said that executives at \"all kinds of organizations\" are spending more time on preparing for and responding to macroeconomic uncertainty. That includes discussions about pricing based on anticipated cost increases from the new tariffs.",
      "When executives spend their time this way, it's a \"deadweight loss, we're not going to see that in GDP,\" she explained.",
      "\"So there's just uncertainty across the board, but I think it's really interesting that no matter what the sector, no matter what kind of businesses they're in, they're talking about the uncertainty tax,\" Cook said.",

    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:18:28 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said two major banks turned down his business. Here's why conservatives are concerned with so-called debanking.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday claimed that major banks are discriminating against conservatives \u2014 including him \u2014 through the act of debanking, or when financial institutions refuse to work with some individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment in an\u00a0interview with CNBC on Tuesday, after he was asked about a report\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal that said he would soon sign an executive order aimed at stamping out debanking. Mr. Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase gave him 20 days to close his account, although he didn't specify when this occurred or what reason he was given by the bank for doing so. He also claimed that Bank of America refused his business after he left JPMorgan.",
      "The issue of debanking has become a sticking point for some conservatives who claim that they've been unfairly targeted by financial institutions. Debanking can occur for a number of reasons, such as if a financial institution detects potentially fraudulent activity or the account owner is overdrawn, but some conservatives claim they have been rejected due to their political views.",
      "\"They discriminated against many conservatives,\" the president told CNBC.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan rejected such allegations of bias against conservatives, in a recent interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that took place ahead of Mr. Trump's comments on CNBC. Moynihan pointed to the nation's second-largest bank's massive customer base as evidence of its diverse clientele. He also emphasized the impact of federal regulations, in addition to concerns over legal and financial risk, on banking decisions.",
      "\"We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not \u2014 the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought,\" the CEO told Margaret Brennan. \"So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.\"",
      "At a\u00a0Senate hearing\u00a0in February over the issue, Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said debanking harms individuals as well as the economy, and violates the principles of fair market access. Debanking has also been highlighted by some crypto investors, such the CEO of crypto platform Anchorage Digital, who\u00a0testified\u00a0in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "The White House declined to comment on the EO.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, adding that it agrees with Mr. Trump that \"regulatory change is desperately needed.\" It added, \"We're pleased to see the White House is addressing this issue, for which we've been advocating for many years, and look forward to working with them to get this right.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Bank of America said, \"Political beliefs are not a factor in account closure decisions.\" Referring to the reported EO, the bank said in a statement that it welcomes \"regulatory clarity\" from the Trump administration.",
      "Reached for comment on Mr. Trump's recent comments, Bank of America pointed to its earlier statement.",
      "What happens when someone is debanked?",
      "Debanking isn't just happening at banks, said Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.",
      "\"This can be something that happens to you at a credit union, at a cryptocurrency exchange or anywhere else really,\" Anthony said. \"It's just having that sudden abrupt closure of your financial account where you've been, and essentially kicked out of the system or cut off from the system.\"",
      "Banks are not required by law to give account owners a reason for why their account is being closed. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks are obligated to track their customers' activity and file a so-called suspicious activity report (or SAR) if they notice anything unusual. Banks aren't allowed to disclose to customers if there's a SAR, which can leave some people in the dark if their account is shut for this reason.",
      "\"It's a terrible feeling to suddenly have this relationship cut off, and you really don't know why,\" Anthony said. \"In a lot of cases, it's by federal law that banks can't tell you what happened, and you're kind of left to just spiral there.\"",
      "How many people are impacted by debanking?",
      "More than 8,000 consumers filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the last three years related to their financial institutions' \"improperly closing checking, savings or other deposit accounts,\" according to a February analysis from the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.",
      "By comparison, consumers made about 1.3 million complaints about credit reporting in 2023 alone, according to CFPB data.",
      "Why do banks close accounts?",
      "Banks can close accounts if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious behavior, or if a customer violates their terms. In the complaints cited by the Senate banking committee analysis, some consumers said they had faced overdraft fees due to overdrawn funds before their banks shuttered their accounts, for example.",
      "But there's no data that tracks whether people or institutions are debanked due to their political views, although there are anecdotal accounts, experts said.",
      "\"There is no actual data or proof that conservatives are being debanked for their beliefs,\" Jeremy Siegel, senior associate at research firm Pleiades Strategy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In fact, Florida set up a hotline for this very reason, and got zero complaints. A Virginia Credit League Lobbyist said this in his testimony against a similar bill in Virginia.\"",
      "Banks set risk tolerances and conduct their business within those perimeters, added Shayna Olesiuk, director of banking policy at Better Markets, a financial advocacy group.",
      "\"They must always understand and manage any risk that they are accepting in their business activities and decisions; this could include things like financial risk or unlawful or discriminatory activity,\" she added.",
      "What about political views and debanking?",
      "There have been allegations from some conservatives that their political views led to account closures. The attorney general for Kansas, Kris W. Kobach, sent a\u00a0letter to Bank of America last year, alleging discrimination by the bank of religious groups he states had their accounts closed without explanation.",
      "Banking policies appear \"to be systematically punishing religious and political views with which it disagrees,\" the Kobach claimed in the letter.",
      "But some of these organizations had red flags that could have led to the debanking, such running a debt collection business outside of the U.S., Cato's Anthony added.",
      "\"There are anecdotal cases of conservative account holders that have had their accounts closed, but at the same time, we see that with others as well,\" he added. \"There's been a longstanding history of people who are Muslim having their accounts denied, people with Russian last names or Middle Eastern last names for that matter, having their accounts denied.\"",
      "\"It seems to be a widespread issue in the sense that it affects all different sorts of people,\" Anthony said.",

      "The study underscores the financial toll a cancer diagnosis can take on individuals, even for those who are insured but don't yet qualify for Medicare. While cancer tends to strike later in life, when most patients in treatment are receiving Medicare benefits, a cancer diagnosis can pose an undue financial burden on younger people with private insurance, the report found.",

    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

      "Women have made significant gains in the workplace over the past two decades, but one segment of female workers has been left behind: those without a college degree.",
      "New research shows a growing divide in progress in the workforce between women who have earned at least a bachelor's degree and those without any higher education.",
      "The share of college-educated women in the workforce increased by nine percentage points between 2004 and 2024, research from Third Way, a think tank advocating for moderate policy, shows. Meanwhile, women without a college degree barely notched gains: The share of noncollege women in the workforce increased by less than a percentage point over the same period, according to the report.",
      "\"This divergence in the labor force experience of women with and without college degrees speaks to changes in recent years in the workplace, and around the culture of work,\" Curran McSwigan, Third Way's deputy director of economics and author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those changes are weighted toward women with degrees.\"",
      "Flex work",
      "For example, flexible work arrangements are now more common across corporations, allowing some workers to do their jobs from home, at least part of the time, and better balance work with caregiving duties.",
      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead the IRS temporarily, the official said. President Trump is expected to nominate Long for an ambassadorship.",
      "The news was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Long was confirmed by the Senate in mid-June and took over the IRS after some tumult for the tax collection agency's leadership. The IRS has had several interim commissioners since Mr. Trump's return to office in January, including one who lasted for just 48 hours. The Trump administration has aimed to dramatically trim the agency's workforce.",
      "A former auctioneer and Missouri Republican congressman, Long was chosen to take over the IRS late last year after previously pushing to repeal much of the tax code during his time in the House. Long isn't an accountant by trade, but Mr. Trump touted his time as a tax adviser. After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",
      "The IRS has been a focus of the Trump administration's government-wide staff cuts. The agency drew up plans earlier this year to cut its 102,000-person workforce by as much as 40% through a combination of layoffs and voluntary resignations, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The cuts were set to begin after April 15, which is the deadline for most Americans to file their taxes.",

      "The watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund, led by a former Obama administration ethics official, has formally requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a Qatari luxury jet on behalf of President Trump.",
      "According to a memo obtained by CBS News, the group asked the Department of Defense's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office to probe whether the Pentagon broke laws and engaged in impropriety by accepting the gift on Mr. Trump's behalf from the Qatari royal family. The memo was sent to the inspector general and GAO on Friday.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund is a nonpartisan advocacy group founded by Obama ethics czar Norm Eisen. Its memo said the agencies should investigate whether the Defense Department had improperly invoked its authorities to accept the jet aircraft and to reportedly transfer $934 million in funding from a nuclear missile program to help retrofit the aircraft.",
      "\"If true, this would mean that the DoD is diverting critical nuclear defense funds to outfit an unprecedented gift from a foreign government to a U.S. president,\" the group said in a 10-page memo.",
      "Earlier this year,\u00a0President Trump confirmed\u00a0that the Qatari royal family was donating a Boeing 747-8 for his use. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet is set to be donated to Mr. Trump's presidential library after his term is over.",
      "\"There are so many things wrong with this picture, it's a challenge to know where to begin,\" said Virginia Canter, chief counsel for ethics and anti-corruption at Democracy Defenders Fund. \"The fact that taxpayers are now funding a fifth Air Force One, originating from a foreign monarchy, is a staggering abuse of public trust, fiscal priorities, and national security interests,\" Canter said.",
      "The memo from Democracy Defenders Fund said the jet was redundant and unnecessary, pointing out the U.S. Air Force operates two 747 jets as Air Force One, and two replacement aircraft were authorized in 2018 for $3.9 billion. Despite the existence of both an active and future fleet, Mr. Trump pursued the $400 million Qatari plane, which he referred to in May as a \"gift.\"",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" the president said.",
      "The memo from the Democracy Defenders Fund also argued that Justice Department guidance prohibits agencies from accepting gifts that would incur costs in future fiscal years, as appears to be the case with the Qatari jet.",
      "\"The Air Force has already made clear that the Qatari jet is not able to operate as Air Force One in its current state,\" the memo said.",
      "The group also argued that even if it were legal, \"the use of the (Defense Department's) statutory authority to accept a foreign gift that is not fit for purpose and then expend a billion dollars from appropriations for nuclear deterrence to upgrade that plane would be wasteful, a gross mismanagement of funds and an abuse of the (Defense Department's) statutory authorities in support of the President's attempt to evade Constitutional restrictions on acceptance of foreign emoluments.\"",
      "A memorandum of understanding between Qatar and the Defense Department that was viewed by CBS News outlined the \"unconditional donation\" of one Boeing 747-8 jumbo aircraft.",
      "It was signed earlier this month by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Qatar's deputy prime minister and minister of state for defense affairs. It does not specifically mention Air Force One but says the jet can be used by the Pentagon \"in any manner it deems appropriate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin gave President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff an award to pass along to a senior CIA official whose son was killed in Ukraine while fighting alongside Russian forces, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The award, the Order of Lenin, was meant to be handed off to Juliane Gallina, whose 21-year-old son, Michael Gloss, was killed in 2024.",
      "Gallina is currently serving at the CIA as deputy director for digital innovation. It could not be immediately determined what was done with the award.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News that Putin gave Witkoff the award during his trip to Russia this week, which a Russian official said the U.S. initiated, to discuss ending the Ukraine war.",
      "The gesture by Putin, known for mind games and attempts to expose adversaries' points of weakness, was likely meant to raise unhelpful questions and highlight that a CIA official's son fought for Russia in the war.",
      "In a statement in April, CIA officials said the death of Gallina's son, who struggled with mental health challenges, was not a national security issue. Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News there was no indication that Gloss had been recruited by the Russian government, and that the Kremlin did not appear to be aware of Gloss's family background when it repatriated his remains.",
      "Spokespeople for the White House, the CIA and Witkoff didn't respond with comment for this article. A Russian embassy spokesman contacted by CBS News said there was no official comment, and no acknowledgement of the award has been publicly disclosed by the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry.",
      "Putin's move comes at a sensitive time, as Mr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Kremlin and has vowed secondary tariffs starting on Friday, even as negotiations are underway for a possible summit.",
      "The Order of Lenin is a Soviet-era award meant to highlight outstanding civilian service. It has been given to high-level spies, including the U.K.'s Kim Philby, a double agent for the Soviet Union. Gallina's son was never an employee of the CIA, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Putin, a former KGB operative, has met five times with Witkoff, who left real estate development to become Mr. Trump's envoy for sensitive peace missions. Witkoff's reliance in the past on Russian government translators during high-stakes diplomacy has drawn scrutiny.",
      "A source familiar with the talks told CBS News that Witkoff had a U.S. government translator with him for the encounter on Wednesday, two days before Mr. Trump's deadline for Putin to end the war or face severe financial penalties via sanctions. That same day, the Trump administration put an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods to punish New Delhi for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Mr. Trump described the Wednesday meeting in Moscow as \"highly productive.\" The White House said the Russians were eager to continue engaging with the United States and said that secondary sanctions were due to be implemented on Friday. However, as of Friday afternoon, no such sanctions had been issued.",
      "On social media, Gloss published posts of himself in Moscow and voiced his support for Russian troops. Russian media first published news of Gloss' death in April. The CIA's statement at the time said Gallina and her family had suffered \"an unimaginable personal tragedy.\"",
      "An obituary for Gloss said he was \"tragically killed in Eastern Europe\" on April 4, 2024.",
      "Gloss's father, Larry Gloss, an Iraq War veteran, told the Washington Post in an interview that he and Gallina did not know their son was in Ukraine or that he had enlisted in the Russian army.",
      "\"Our biggest fear while we were waiting for him to be repatriated was that someone over there [in Moscow] would put two and two together and figure out who his mother was, and use him as a prop,\" Larry Gloss said.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday it is terminating its $7 billion Solar for All program that was designed to bring renewable and affordable energy to low-income communities. Sources confirmed to CBS News earlier this week that the agency planned to scrap the program.",
      "Solar for All\u00a0provided funding to 60 grant recipients that planned to create or expand existing low-income solar programs, with the goal of enabling 900,000 households across the country in disadvantaged communities to utilize solar energy to reduce their home energy bills.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement posted\u00a0on X: \"The One Big Beautiful Bill eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included a $7 billion pot called 'Solar for All.' ... The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.\"",
      "CBS News reported Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget reached out to the EPA about terminating the program. One source told CBS News that several senators, both Republicans and Democrats, reached out to the EPA and asked it to reconsider, as many of these recipients are state energy and environmental offices in both red and blue states.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report on the plans.",
      "Groundswell, a nonprofit Solar for All grant recipient that works in eight Southern states, has more than $156 million in grant funding on the line. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth over $20 million.",
      "\"This program covers every single state and U.S. territories, more than 60% of the awards went to state energy offices,\" Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore told CBS News. Moore was quick to point out that awards were granted to stakeholders in both red and blue states, adding: \"There's a lot at stake here.\"",
      "As electricity bills rise, which experts believe may only increase as more energy-hungry data centers come online, Moore saw Solar for All as a tool to lower energy costs in the South.",
      "\"Solar for All is an investment in energy infrastructure that's going to serve that residential customer that's going to keep energy rates in America more affordable and more fair,\" she said.",
      "Solar for All awarded grants in August 2024 to 49 state-level agencies, six tribes and five multi-state award recipients, according to the EPA. They include state agencies like the Alaska Energy Authority, which was granted a $62 million award to offer access to renewable energy in both urban and rural areas. Harris County, Texas, which encompasses Houston, was awarded $249 million to provide distributed solar and battery storage to disadvantaged communities in the state, and plan on using the money to support workforce training for low-income residents as well as minority and women-owned businesses.",
      "\"Solar for All was a focused program where grants were used to help low- and middle-income households reduce their household electricity costs by up to 20% through solar and storage,\" said Zealan Hoover, who was a senior adviser to former EPA administrator Michael Regan in the Biden administration. Hoover spent three years at the EPA helping to implement more than $100 billion in programs authorized under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"If the EPA is successful in terminating these grants, I anticipate most of the grantees will sue for unlawful termination,\" Hoover told CBS News. \"If the EPA is ultimately successful, then most recipients will have lost years of work across the country to help low-income households, and all the work will be for naught.\"",
      "Cody Two Bears, CEO of Indigenized Energy, helps tribes and members of the Menominee Nation pursue what it calls \"energy sovereignty.\" Indigenized Energy belongs to a coalition of tribes that were awarded more than $135 million to build solar projects in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",
      "Indigenized Energy completed one of the first Solar for All projects in the country earlier this year, despite setbacks when funding had been frozen by the federal government earlier this year.",
      "He said cutting the Solar for All program is a reminder of the distrust between Native American tribes and the federal government.",
      "\"Tribes have always endured broken promises for many generations at the federal level, and this is just another broken promise that tribal nations have to face from our federal government,\" Cody Two Bears told CBS News.",
      "Indigenous families face, on average, a 28% higher energy burden according to the Department of Energy.",
      "\"It's devastating news to Indian country and to Native tribes,\" he said. \"I think the hardest part of this is, we were a year into this process of this five-year grant, and it brought a lot of hope to our tribes. It brought a lot of opportunity and jobs that will be lost if they were to remove this program.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A divided federal appeals court on Friday granted the Trump administration's request to set aside a district judge's decision\u00a0finding probable cause\u00a0that some federal officials committed criminal contempt by violating an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador.",
      "The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a massive victory for the Trump administration, which has lambasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for overstepping his authority when he initiated criminal contempt proceedings in April.",
      "The D.C. Circuit had issued a temporary pause of Boasberg's decision while it took more time to consider the issue. In an unsigned opinion issued Friday, Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both appointed by President Trump in his first term, granted a request from the Justice Department to toss out Boasberg's contempt order. Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act case",
      "The dispute over Boasberg's contempt order stems from immigration officials' efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, which President Trump invoked in March to swiftly remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "In response to a fast-moving legal challenge brought by a group of migrants in Washington, D.C., over the removals, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and issued an oral order directing the Trump administration to return Venezuelan migrants subject to Mr. Trump's declaration who were on planes bound for El Salvador back to the U.S. A written order issued shortly after prevented the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "But Boasberg said that despite his injunctions, the Trump administration did not stop the removals, and the planes carrying the migrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act landed in El Salvador. The planes were already outside U.S. airspace when Boasberg issued his order blocking U.S. officials from \"removing\" the detainees, a fact that the appeals court noted in ruling for the administration. Most of the people were transferred to El Salvador's notorious supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "The administration's actions raised questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order, and the judge in April ruled that probable cause existed to find government officials in criminal contempt over what he was their defiance. Boasberg said the government's actions demonstrated a \"willful disregard\" for his order.",
      "\"The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,\" Boasberg wrote in his decision. He said the Trump administration could remedy his contempt findings by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of his order, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's contempt finding and asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the decision, which it then agreed to do.",
      "In a concurring opinion on Friday, Katsas wrote that the dispute over the removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March \"involves an extraordinary, ongoing confrontation between the Executive and Judicial Branches.\" He noted that the proceedings do not involve the lawfulness of removals made under the Alien Enemies Act in March, and said the court may not decide at this time \"whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter.\"",
      "Still, Katsas wrote that a decision in favor of the Trump administration is appropriate because \"the government is plainly correct about the merits of the criminal contempt, and our saying so now would prevent long disputes between the Executive and the Judiciary over difficult, contentious issues regarding the courts' power to control foreign policy or prosecutions, or to impose criminal sanctions for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.\"",
      "\"In circumstances much less fraught than these, courts have reviewed interlocutory orders through mandamus to prevent extended inter-branch conflict,\" Katsas said.",
      "He wrote that Boasberg's contempt finding \"raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses.\"",
      "In her dissent, Pillard argued that Boasberg's contempt findings were appropriate, and said the majority's decision to throw out the contempt findings was \"in error.\"",
      "\"Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,\" Pillar wrote. \"When it appears that a judicial order has been disobeyed, the court's ability to learn who was responsible is the first step to accountability.\"",
      "Since Boasberg's findings and the appeals court's stay of his order, 252 Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to CECOT were sent from El Salvador back to their home country as part of a prisoner swap involving the U.S.",
      "Tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary have escalated across Mr. Trump's second term, as judges have issued decisions blocking implementation of many aspects of the president's agenda. But the clash between Boasberg and the president has been one of the most fierce, and the judge's contempt finding marked the most direct rebuke of the administration so far.",

      "\"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City,\" he wrote.",
      "Three sources briefed on the D.C. deployment said the additional officers will come from the D.C. National Guard, FBI, U.S. Marshals, ICE, U.S. Secret Service and additional components of the Department of Homeland Security. One source added that officials from the relevant law enforcement agencies met Thursday to review plans for deployment.",
      "A White House official later confirmed to CBS News that the increased federal law enforcement presence on D.C. streets would begin at midnight Thursday and would focus on tourist areas and other known hotspots. Along with the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service, the official said the operation would involve multiple federal agencies \u2014 including U.S. Capitol Police, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, among others.",
      "The official disclosed the increased police presence would be part of a seven-day operation that could be extended as needed. The federal officers on patrol would be highly visible in marked units, the official said.",
      "\"Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday night. \"President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C. President Trump is committed to making our Nation's capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.\"",
      "Overnight Wednesday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was notified of an increased federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital, and she approved the request by the White House to put additional officers on the streets, according to an official in the mayor's office. A\u00a0spokesperson for the D.C. mayor's office later denied Bowser had approved the federal deployment.",
      "But otherwise, there's been little to no coordination between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal law enforcement, a D.C. police source said. The agency has not been notified about what the increase in law enforcement might look like across the nation's capital, according to the source. The department has been hamstrung by Congress since House Republicans refused in June to consider a measure to restore hundreds of millions of dollars of its funding. There's currently a hiring freeze for D.C. Police professional staff and restrictions on overtime for officers.",
      "Asked by CBS News about the plans to increase federal law enforcement D.C., the District's U.S. Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, expressed uncertainty about any impending changes but said, \"My understanding is that both the Trump administration and the Metropolitan Police Department are looking to increase law enforcement efforts because of the violence we're seeing across this \u2026 city.\"",
      "Pressed further by a reporter, she added that it was \"a decision for the president.\"",
      "\"Young people are being coddled,\" Pirro said. \"They need to be held accountable. They shouldn't be going to arts and crafts in D.C. family court.\" Pirro also made reference to a 19-year-old who had used an illegal gun to fire shots on a Metrobus and was subsequently charged and sentenced to parole.",
      "\"All I want to do is clean up D.C. That's why the president put me here,\" Pirro said. \"And youth crime is on the rise.\"",
      "Pirro also mentioned that four years ago, her office had handled 150,000 cases of youth violence. \"We now have nearly half a million,\" she said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the increase in federal law enforcement in D.C. is in compliance with President Trump's \"Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\" executive order signed on March 28, and is part of fulfilling his campaign promise to make America safe again.",
      "That executive order said federal law enforcement officers could be deployed in D.C., in areas around the National Mall and Memorial Parks, museums, monuments, Lafayette Park, Union Station, Rock Creek Park, Anacostia Park, the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Suitland Parkway, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.",
      "Federal law enforcement and National Park Services have, according to the order, already been used to arrest undocumented immigrants, and remove homelessness encampments in the District.",
      "What do D.C. crime statistics say?",
      "In 2023, there was a sharp increase in crime in the nation's capital, making D.C. one of America's deadliest cities. In response, Congress even blocked revisions to Washington, D.C.'s criminal code for the first time in 31 years, in March 2023.",
      "But violent crime in D.C. has tapered off, decreasing since the start of 2024; it's part of a larger nationwide drop in murder rates that has hit its lowest level in decades.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-census-2030-undocumented-immigrants/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 10:19:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The Census Bureau said it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he had instructed the Department of Commerce to \"immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate\" census that would exclude undocumented immigrants.",
      "But the census is a massive undertaking and has huge repercussions nationally, including on congressional seat alignment \u2014 so it's not something that can be changed quickly. In fact, the Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
      "Asked for comment on Mr. Trump's post, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement: \"The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the census process:",
      "The Constitution requires the Census be taken every 10 years",
      "Per Article I, Section 2: \"The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.\" Congress codified the decennial census into law in 1954. The Constitution also mandates that reapportionment (the designation of how many Congressional seats a state gets) happens every 10 years, in line with the Census. Redistricting then uses that apportionment and then states are supposed to redraw lines every 10 years, when they know how many Congressional seats they will have for the decade.",
      "The actual data collection for the 2030 Census is supposed to start in ... 2030",
      "It's a long process to design the Census process, send out the Census forms and then have enumerators physically go out to collect the rest of the data for people who don't mail their form back or fill it out online. The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in\u00a02019. But the actual surveys and collection of data at a large scale begins on Census Day, April 1 of each decade year. Currently, the\u00a0bureau's timeline\u00a0has them in the \"Development and Integration Phase\" which includes more design planning, and small-scale field tests.",
      "Citizenship question in the Census?",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but that was\u00a0rejected in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. But that decision kept the door open to including that question in the future, but concluded that the reason given by the administration and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was \"contrived\" and \"pretextual.\" Because of a tight timeline for when Census forms had to be finalized in 2019, the Trump administration didn't have time to appeal and find another avenue to get the citizenship question on the Census. With Census collection for 2030 still years away, there's a longer runway to legally try and get a citizenship question on the form.",
      "The Census Bureau does take annual surveys/data gathering, but not for population count that would impact redistricting",
      "Since 2005, the Bureau conducts the \"American Community Survey\" every year to collect social, economic, housing and demographic information from a\u00a0sample\u00a0of households in all 50 states.\u00a0This\u00a0survey does ask about place of birth, citizenship and year of entry into the U.S. But the Bureau maintains that the data remains anonymous.",
      "\"No one is able to figure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce,\" the Census website\u00a0states.",
      "Is political party collected in the Census?",
      "No. There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election. But the decennial Census does not ask about political party, income or religion.",
      "Black, Latino and Indigenous populations were undercounted in the 2020 census",
      "The Bureau and experts cited delays caused by COVID-19 and a chilling effect by Mr. Trump's attempt to introduce a citizenship question on the Census form, as the reason for the undercount. Latinos saw about a 5% undercount in 2020, compared to 1.54% in the 2010 Census. The undercount rate for the Black population was 3.3% in 2020, compared to 2% in 2010. Overall, the Census Bureau's post-enumeration survey found that there was a net coverage undercount of 0.25% or 782,000 for the nation.",
      "How do Congressional seats work with the Census?",
      "In 1911, Congress set the number of seats at 435, a number which was permanently set by the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. The number of seats each state gets is determined by population, with a minimum of one. California has the most with 52, followed by Texas with 38 and Florida with 28.",
      "Given population changes, the number of Congressional seats each state gets is determined by the census. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in July suggested that the census should be redone since he believed Florida should have gotten two new seats instead of just one.",
      "Based off the number of seats each state receives, the Congressional districts are then set, either by the state legislature or an independent commission. Mr. Trump is currently locked in a redistricting battle in Texas, where he has instructed the state's Republicans to redraw the districts to give the GOP an advantage in up to five more seats.",
      "The very public battle in Texas has led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom saying he, too, could redraw the map for Democrats, and has also led several other states to start looking at creating new districts for partisan advantage.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 22:42:57 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that President Trump's administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Maryland ruled late Thursday that President Trump's administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily, issuing the fourth court decision blocking the president's birthright citizenship order nationwide since a key U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June.",
      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman's preliminary injunction was expected after the judge said last month she would issue such an order if the case were returned to her by an appeals court. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to her later in July.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. Since June, two other district courts, as well as an appellate panel of judges, have also blocked the birthright order nationwide.",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed\u00a0an executive order\u00a0that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government\u00a0argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "Boardman, in February, issued a preliminary injunction blocking the order nationwide. But the June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court upended that decision and other court rulings blocking the order across the nation.",
      "The high court's\u00a0ruling in June\u00a0limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court\u00a0paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled on in July, the government\u00a0has argued\u00a0that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states\u00a0argue\u00a0that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",
      "In her ruling Thursday, Boardman certified a class of all children who have been born or will be born in the United States after Feb. 19, 2025, who would be affected by Trump's order.",
      "She said the plaintiffs in the lawsuit before her were \"extremely likely\" to win their argument that the birthright order violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. They were also likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order went into effect, she wrote.",

      "The footage, from a body camera worn by a Metropolitan Police Department officer, was first published Thursday by NPR. The network joined CBS News and other news organizations in suing to obtain thousands of hours of surveillance footage and court exhibits from the more than 1,000 criminal cases brought by the Justice Department against people who allegedly participated in the Capitol attack.",
      "Among those defendants was Jared Wise, who eventually faced six charges as a result of his alleged actions on Jan. 6. He pleaded not guilty. Wise's hiring by the Justice Department was reported last month. A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement that Wise \"is a valued member of The Department of Justice and we appreciate his contributions to our team.\"",
      "Wise was employed as a special agent and supervisory special agent with the FBI from 2004 through 2017, according to the Justice Department.",
      "He was indicted in May 2023 on six counts that arose out of his alleged actions on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building to protest the 2020 election results. Among the charges was one count of civil disorder and one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding an officer of the U.S. performing their official duties.",
      "In accompanying court papers, an FBI agent said that video footage depicted Wise inside the Capitol building on the afternoon of Jan. 6 after entering from a Senate door. Body camera footage from the Metropolitan Police Department also showed Wise engaging with police officers outside the Capitol, telling them, \"You guys are disgusting. I'm former \u2014 I'm former law enforcement. You're disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can't see it because you're chasing a pension, right? Your pension. Your retirement right?\"",
      "The footage shows him continuing to yell at the officers, telling them, \"Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!\"",
      "When police who were attempting to move protesters back from the Capitol were knocked to the ground in front of Wise, the video shows him shouting toward them \"Yeah, f*** them! Yeah, kill 'em!\" He also allegedly yelled toward rioters attacking a police line, \"Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Kill 'em!\"",
      "Wise had lived in New Braunfels, Texas, until June 2022, after which he moved to Bend, Oregon, according to court records. An unidentified tipster told the FBI in January 2022 that Wise shared he was inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, the agent said. The FBI then obtained a court-authorized search warrant for Wise's records, which confirmed he was around the Capitol that day, according to the filing.",
      "Wise pleaded not guilty to the charges in June 2023. A trial was set to begin last fall and was ultimately held in January. But before the jury could begin deliberating, Mr. Trump issued blanket pardons to roughly 1,500 defendants charged for their alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "The Justice Department asked the court to dismiss Wise's case on Jan. 20, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, and it was granted one day later, filings show.",

Texas undertook its redistricting effort after President Trump suggested in mid-July the state should redraw for Republican advantage. About a week earlier, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, had written to the Texas governor and state attorney general to complain that four of the state's current districts were \"coalition districts\" \u2014 that is, districts with different racial groups that support the same candidate \u2014 that were \"not protected by the Voting Rights Act.\"",

      "In other states, congressional delegations already heavily skew toward one party, limiting the number of gains that can be made. Maryland's eight-member delegation has just one Republican, and in Illinois, Democrats control 14 of the 17 House seats.",
      "Looming over the redistricting efforts is a case before the Supreme Court that could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and attempts to remedy alleged vote dilution. The dispute involves Louisiana's congressional map, and while the high court heard arguments in March, it set the case for re-argument in its next term, which starts in October.",
      "The long-running court fight began after the state's GOP-led legislature adopted a map with one majority-minority district, but was ordered to add a second majority-Black district by a federal judge who said the original map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Louisiana's map now includes two majority-Black districts out of its six House seats.",
      "The high court asked the parties Friday to file new papers on whether the intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates the Constitution's 14th Amendment \u2014 an indication that the court will be weighing whether race-based redistricting is lawful.",

      "Mr. Trump has pointed to Texas as key for Republicans in trying to maintain their House majority and said he believes the GOP can pick up five seats through a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' voting boundaries.",
      "Texas Republicans unveiled their proposed map last week, which meets the president's goal of five additional GOP-leaning districts. Under the new map, if enacted, Republicans could win up to 30 of the state's 38 House districts.",
      "A state House panel voted Saturday to advance the redrawn map in a party-line vote.",
      "In response to the redistricting bid, dozens of Democratic state lawmakers fled Texas for Chicago and New York in an effort to deny Republicans a quorum Monday and block them from adopting the new map.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said he would seek to strip the absent Democrats of their membership in the Texas state House, and GOP state lawmakers approved a motion Monday for the Texas House sergeant-at-arms to secure the attendance of missing Democrats \"under warrant of arrest if necessary.\" Abbott on Tuesday filed a lawsuit to the Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office if he did not return by Thursday.",
      "U.S. Sen. John Cornyn wrote a letter to the FBI asking the agency to help track down the lawmakers, and Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the FBI \"may have to\" get involved.",
      "California",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that left the drawing of congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that he would push for a multi-step plan that would allow the lines of the House districts to be drawn by the state legislature \u2014 and in the middle of the decade.",
      "Under the proposal, the governor would call a special election for early November to have voters approve the new congressional map.",
      "Newsom suggested Monday that there were drafts of new maps in progress and said his team helped initiate conversations with Democratic leadership. The re-crafted map could increase the seats Democrats hold by five, according to the Associated Press.",
      "\"The maps, we believe should be transparent, they should be provided in a transparent way to the public, and as a consequence, those maps are being processed and will be brought to light,\" he said.",
      "He added, \"The ultimate determination will be by the people of the state of California. We will offer them the opportunity to make judgment for themselves \u2014 again, only if Texas moves forward. We would maintain the framework of the independent redistricting commission that I support, that I believe in. We would just allow for this mid-census redistricting to occur just for congressional maps in 26, 28 and 30.\"",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats hold 43 of those seats.",
      "Indiana",
      "In Indiana, Republicans control seven of nine congressional seats. The state last redistricted in 2021, and some in the GOP orbit have floated another redistricting effort ahead of the midterms.",
      "Vice President JD Vance met with local legislators, including Gov. Mike Braun, at the Indiana Statehouse on Thursday, Aug. 7, where redistricting was among the topics discussed, according to administration officials.",
      "Several White House officials were also in attendance at the meeting, including Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Alex Meyer and White House counsel Dave Warrington.",

      "Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan's seat in the northwest corner of the state, bordering parts of Chicago's suburbs, could be a target as Republicans consider an effort to redraw the state's congressional maps. The Indiana Legislature, overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans, is tasked with drawing its congressional districts.",
      "New York",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have suggested that the Democratic-controlled legislature could create new congressional maps that are more friendly to Democrats.",
      "\"We're sick and tired of being pushed around when other states don't have the same aspirations that we always have had, and I hold those dear, but I cannot ignore that,\" Hochul said at a press conference with some Texas Democratic lawmakers earlier this week. \"This the playing field has changed dramatically, and shame on us if we ignore that fact and cling tight to the vestiges of the past. That era is over. Donald Trump eliminated that. Forever.\"",
      "But New York faces some steep obstacles in trying to redraw the maps before the midterms. New York's constitution calls for a bipartisan commission to draw up the congressional maps, although the state Assembly and Senate get final approval. In the 2021 redistricting, New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, said Democrats had \"unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts\" and ordered a special master to redraw the district.",
      "With the help of these maps, Republicans were able to flip four seats in New York in the 2022 elections, making the congressional delegation 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans. Democrats sued, and in a 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals said those maps were supposed to be temporary and ordered an independent commission to redraw the maps. The new districts gave Democrats a slight edge. With these maps, Democrats flipped four seats in 2024, giving them 19 seats in the state and Republicans seven.",
      "If Democrats wanted to lead an effort to change New York's constitution, it would require an affirmative vote in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature, and then it would have to be approved by voters, as Hochul herself noted on Monday. The 2025 legislative session is already over, with the next session starting in January 2026.",
      "\"This could be really more on the ballot in the fall of '27 and be enacted in time for the congressional races in 2028 as well as the presidential \u2014 so, it is not the timeline that I would have preferred, but it does shave off four years from another through the process,\" Hochul said Monday. \"But we're going to also look at litigation strategies. We're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "The state constitution also prohibits mid-decade redistricting, and any new proposal to amend it to allow a redrawing of state lines before the next census would have to clear the current state legislature and the one elected in 2026.",
      "\"The earliest that could go into effect would be after the 2027 elections, preventing the state from re-redistricting until the 2028 election cycle,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and professor at New York Law School.",
      "Following Hochul's suggestion that the state's redistricting commission be disbanded, Wice said it's not a surprise that some are calling for it to be scrapped after the panel failed to complete its work in 2022 \u2014 until a court stepped in.",
      "\"A state legislature can draw a responsibly developed map if it follows objective and prioritized criteria and works in an open and transparent manner, inviting public participation and review,\" he said.",
      "Missouri",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Missouri, and the Legislature is tasked with drawing its congressional districts. State lawmakers approved a congressional redistricting plan in 2022, after which Republicans won six of Missouri's eight congressional seats.",
      "But some state lawmakers want to extend the GOP's hold on the congressional map to 7-1. State party leaders may target the 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Although Cleaver won by over 23 points in 2024, Republicans in neighboring districts each won by more than 40 points.",
      "The only time Missouri has engaged in mid-decade redistricting was in the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled each district had to be nearly equal in population, and a new Senatorial Appointment Commission was established to redraw the Congressional districts for the 1966 election.",
      "State Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin told Columbia's KSSZ 93.9 last week that it is \"likely\" the Legislature would be called in for a special session by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. He told St. Louis' Fox affiliate over the weekend that he supported the idea, saying \"is Missouri represented properly in Washington, D.C., and, quite frankly, what can we do to support President Trump's agenda?\"",
      "Lt. Gov. David Wasinger also indicated support for redrawing the congressional map, noting in a statement that Missouri is a \"solidly conservative state.\"",
      "\"Despite this, our current congressional map still sends two progressive Democrats to push a liberal agenda in D.C., misrepresenting the will of Missouri voters,\" he said in a statement. \"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them.\"",
      "The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a coalition of conservative state lawmakers, has also been urging Kehoe, a Republican, to convene a special session of the state General Assembly to redraw its congressional map \"consistent with President Trump's recommendation.\"",
      "\"The most current congressional map that was passed was a weak compromise \u2014 inconsistent with the political will of Missouri voters,\" the Missouri Freedom Caucus said in a statement last week. \"It's time this super-majority Republican party in Missouri grows a spine and actually delivers the congressional map that reflects the strong conservative values of this great state, as the political makeup of this state clearly demands.\"",
      "Florida",
      "In Florida, the congressional maps are created by the Legislature and approved by the governor.",
      "Florida Republicans have 20 seats in the U.S. House, with Democrats holding just eight. Although Democrats had challenged the current maps in court, the Florida Supreme Court in July upheld the elimination of a majority Black district.",
      "Despite that victory, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that he was \"seriously\" looking at asking the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the maps.",
      "DeSantis has also criticizedlong insisted that he felt the 2020 Census was flawed and Florida should have gained two Congressional seats, rather than one.",
      "\"I do think we are going to be looking at the pathways to be able do the redistricting here in Florida,\" DeSantis said on July 30.",
      "On Thursday, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez sent a memo to lawmakers announcing he was creating a select committee on redistricting.",
      "\"Please be advised that we will not be appointing to the select committee anyone who has expressed an interest in running for Congress,\" the memo to lawmakers said. \"In addition, while as elected Members of the House you are free to express your own opinions, statements about redistricting that suggest an intent to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party, which is currently prohibited by the Florida Constitution, will also disqualify you from consideration.\"",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Florida state government, controlling the governor's mansion and both chambers of the Legislature. It would be difficult for Florida Democrats to break quorum because a simple majority is only needed for a quorum in Tallahassee, and Democrats are a superminority.",

    "story": [
      "The number of people receiving treatment at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center \u2014 the renowned research hospital that cares for patients with rare or life-threatening diseases \u2014 has tumbled under the second Trump administration, according to government documents and interviews with current and former NIH employees.",
      "NIH documents viewed by KFF Health News show a pronounced decline in patients at the 200-bed hospital from February through April, a time that coincides with the Department of Health and Human Services' mass firings of government employees, the gutting of scientific research, and the administration's broad crackdown on immigration. The average number of patients being treated daily during that time hovered between 60 and 80, with the April numbers falling to the lower end of that range. By contrast, in October, about 80 patients per day on average were at the hospital.",
      "The number of cancer clinical trial participants at the hospital as of July was down about 20% from last year, one NIH cancer scientist said. KFF Health News agreed not to identify the scientist and others who participated in this article who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The numbers \"really don't look too good,\" Pius Aiyelawo, acting CEO of the clinical center, said during a May 23 meeting of the NIH Clinical Center Research Hospital Board.",
      "As of April 30, the average number of patients in the hospital per day had declined by 5.7% compared with the same period a year ago.",
      "Adults and children with cancer, people who need bone marrow transplants, and people with rare diseases or infections are among the patients who receive care at no charge at the NIH hospital, according to former officials. Clinicians there provide potentially lifesaving treatments as part of clinical trials, often to people who have run out of options.",
      "Research at the hospital has also led to breakthroughs about cancer, traumatic brain injury, and AIDS, among other ailments. James Gilman, a physician who was CEO of the clinical center from 2017 until retiring in January, said the center has driven important advances against disease \"that couldn't have happened anywhere else.\"",
      "Former officials said the drop in patients this year is a consequence of the upheaval the Trump administration has caused at the NIH, the world's largest public funder of scientific research.",
      "Current and former employees say an exodus of clinicians, scientists, and other staffers has limited how many patients can be treated. Morale has tanked because of widespread firings and the administration's cancellation of grants that funded research into health disparities, vaccines, the health of LGBTQ+ people, and more. Contracts have been cut, and scientists have seen delays in getting essential supplies for clinical research.",
      "\"Every day seems to be some type of breaking point,\" one NIH worker said.",
      "During the May board meeting, a video of which KFF Health News viewed, Aiyelawo attributed the decrease in patients coming to the hospital to the departure of NIH investigators \u2014 the researchers on studies \u2014 and less patient recruitment. He also noted 11 recent departures of clinical center staffers. They included Christine Grady, a nurse who led the center's bioethics department and the wife of Anthony Fauci, the former head of the NIH's infectious diseases institute who became a lightning rod for conservatives during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "HHS has fired more than 1,200 NIH employees this year as part of its purge of the federal workforce, but the true number of departures is almost certainly higher. Others have opted for early retirement or quit because they opposed the Trump administration's orders.",
      "Gilman said the NIH hospital relies on a \"very complex ecosystem and network to find patients who are not too sick\" to potentially be enrolled in a clinical trial. When researchers leave, \"those patients are lost,\" he said.",
      "The clinical center's 2025 annual report said there were roughly 1,500 research studies underway in 2024, including studies focused on cancer, infectious disease, heart and lung conditions, and blood disorders. Clinical trials accounted for about half.",
      "The National Cancer Institute \u2014 which is the largest of the NIH's 27 institutes and has been crippled by cuts and chaos this year \u2014 typically has the most patients needing inpatient care, Gilman said.",
      "\"What has happened here since January has been a pretty traumatic time for that ecosystem,\" he said, \"and there are pieces of it that will take a long time to rebuild, if indeed they get a chance to rebuild.\"",
      "During the May board meeting, Aiyelawo said NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya \"is very aware\" that fewer people are getting treated at the hospital \"and we're doing everything we can to be able to get those numbers up.\"",
      "The drop in patients this year isn't isolated to people needing inpatient care, NIH documents show. As of the end of April, outpatient visits were down 8.5% compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year. The number of new patients overall had declined by 6.7%, to about 3,370 people.",
      "In response to questions, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote in an emailed statement that the clinical center \"remains fully operational and continues to provide world-class clinical research and patient care. Every day, patients from across the country and around the globe come here to participate in cutting-edge studies that drive scientific discovery and improve health outcomes.\"",
      "\"As the crown jewel of research and discovery, the Clinical Center is a top priority\" under Bhattacharya's leadership, Nixon said. \"We are committed to fully leveraging its capabilities as the nation's hub for clinical research innovation. Our focus remains on empowering the research community and advancing the critical mission of making medical breakthroughs possible right here on the NIH campus.\"",
      "Even before President Trump began his second term, the hospital had struggled with lagging patient numbers. Before the pandemic, it averaged more than 110 patients daily.

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

The Trump administration has not, pausing all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine earlier this year.",
      "Heer told CBS News he voted for President Trump in the 2024 election.

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that airs on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025. This interview was taped on Aug. 1, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by United States Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer. Ambassador, good to have you here.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Great to be here. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President signed this executive order on Thursday, raises tariff rates on about 70 countries. Should we expect those to be negotiated down in the coming days?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: I don't, I don't think they will be in the coming days. I think a lot of these, well I know a lot of these, are set rates pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced,\u00a0 some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country. So, so these, these tariff rates are pretty much set. I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the President's tariff plan right now with these rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was reading some interviews you had given, and you said at some point the President's view is maybe a tariff is better than a deal. Are you saying there are countries that just, they have no shot of avoiding a tariff?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I would say that, in fact, most countries in the world, they just have a tariff assigned to them, right? Whether it's\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll be the 10 percent or 15 percent.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: 10 or 15 or the higher level tariff. Because, again, when the President is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do. And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this. And you know, sometimes a country will come back and make additional concessions that, that make it more appropriate. He's trying to get at the deficit. He's trying to reshore manufacturing. And so those are the factors he's looking at when he's looking at when he's determining whether he's just going to have a tariff or he'll take a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying to reshore manufacturing, bring manufacturing jobs back to America. But we just saw in this unemployment data that while the level is pretty low overall, it's pretty steady, good. Manufacturing in particular, we saw it contract for the fifth straight month in July, factory employment dropped to lowest levels in five years. What does that data indicate to you about the impact of your tariffs?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Yeah, I saw that and my own view is that I think a lot of companies were waiting to see if the tax bill was going to come through with the expensing for capital goods and things like that. And so I think now you know a lot of that data comes pre \"One Big Beautiful Bill\". Now that we have \"One Big Beautiful Bill\", and we have a better sense of where the taxes are going, I think we're going to see a much, we're going to see more investment, all the, all the commitments on investment we've seen countries making, that's going to come through. And like you said, it's a relatively small number. So I don't, I don't read tariff policy into that number. I think that is kind of pre-bill policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you believe the executives are making strategic decisions with hiring, but the President just announced that the head of Labor Statistics is being fired because of the weak jobs report, claiming the data was faked.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I think you know, and I saw what the president did, and he also talked about the, just the record from BLS, you know, last year\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Labor Statistics Bureau.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: That's right, yeah, exactly. You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers and so it sounds to me like the President has real concerns. You know, not just based on today's but everything we saw last year. You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it's, you know, the President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were just saying you weren't really doubting the data.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: No, I wasn't\u2013 You asked me what I thought about the data\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:",
      "Right.",
      "JAMIESON GREER:\u2013And was it reflected in the tariff policy? The answer is no. I mean, my view is, to the extent that there's some kind of, you know, information about manufacturing jobs, you know, I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the \"one big, beautiful bill\" passed, now that we have the expensing going in. And I think that, you know, our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident, though \u2013 because you have to deal in legal terms, in details, with facts and data when you are negotiating a legal agreement \u2013 do you trust that if you bring hard data to the president, he takes your counsel, even if it's an inconvenient fact?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Always, yes. I mean, I've spent the- I spend many hours with the president almost every day, and that's what we're talking about is data. We're looking - and I'm on the trade side, of course - and we're looking at import figures, export figures, investment levels, et cetera. And that's how we're making this decision. So I'm very comfortable with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've seen that Apple estimates, for the full year, tariffs are going to cost them more than a billion dollars. For the automakers - GM, Stellantis, Ford - they all came out and said they are going to take a hit from this.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, so that's exactly the issue, right? We have, over decades, we've had these large manufacturers, advanced manufacturing, that have gone overseas. They've gone to other countries. They've taken advantage of unfair trading practices, and the fact that the US has had low tariffs while other countries haven't, and they've taken advantage of that. That's what businesses do. We're all capitalists. And so if now they have to pay a tariff or build here, the President is creating incentives to bring them back here. That's why GM has announced investments here in the United States, and that's why we have all these companies and countries announcing investment in the US. Because the tariffs create the incentive to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But reductions in profits come at a cost, right? And as CEOs are making decisions, how long do you expect this pain to last for corporate America?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, you know, again, when we look at- you know, when we look at the numbers and the data, we're seeing predictions of more investment here. That's what we want. The President isn't doing this so much for the companies. He's doing it for American workers who have seen their jobs offshored to Mexico, to Vietnam, to China. So when we hear companies having to make hard choices about supply chain changes. We have to do that. I mean the status quo, where we keep making things overseas, because we can do it a little bit cheaper in the short run. That is not preferable to having that investment and employment here in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we haven't seen that reshoring happen.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, we have- we have announced AstraZeneca announced they're going to have a $50 billion investment in pharmaceuticals. GM has announced $5 billion. Hyundai Steel has said they're going to do a $21 billion investment in Louisiana. So this is- this is actually happening. These are things from the company saying it right, and they have to say it. And they have, you know, earnings reports, and they have and- they have filings. They can't just make this stuff up. This is real investment that we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Canada, which is our second largest- largest trading partner. The president increased tariffs to 35%. It applies, though, to just about 10% of what Canada sells here. Why bother to do this now in the middle of negotiations?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So I would say, first of all, you know, Canada is subject to 50% tariffs on steel, aluminum. 25% tariffs on autos, and again, the 35% tariff on- on goods that don't follow the rules of USMCA. And, you know, early on, the president posed a 25% tariff on Canada, and that was really about fentanyl and border issues, right? It's- it's- it's a separate regime from the reciprocal tariff. And what did Canada do in response? You know, they talked about helping at the border. And I'm not, you know, I'm not the drug czar or anything. But what I do know, as the trade guy, is that Canada retaliated. The only other country in the world who retaliated on tariffs was the Chinese. And so if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness. So we have to go up too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about the things that the former Prime Minister Trudeau put in place, not the\u00a0 current Prime Minister--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- And are still in place--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That are still in place. But the current prime minister has held off, largely, on retaliation here. That's the guy you're negotiating with and his team. So what's the strategy here? And aren't you worried that this will hurt the broader free trade deal if you truly do want to renegotiate it next year.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well- well, the President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system. So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So I hear you drawing distinctions when you say I'm the trade guy, I'm not the drug czar.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm the trade guy. I'm not handling these other things. But the President is kind of blending all these things together, because he cited fentanyl once again when it came to tariffs-\u00a0 to the policy with Canada. He also said on social media, Canada's decision to back statehood for Palestine is going to make it hard for us to make a trade deal. How does that have anything to do with financial and trade agreements?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so- so, first of all, the president United States has his foreign affairs power where he can- he can manage relations under the Constitution with foreign countries. Second of all, you know, Congress delegated to the president the ability to take economic action in response to national emergencies in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And for example, the Treasury Department, they have a number of sanctions where they can actually cut off a country's trade with the United States, prohibit goods, cut them off from our financial system for geopolitical reasons. So the fact that they can do that- almost certainly the President can do something that's not as expansive and just- and just put a fee on those goods, which is a- which is a tariff. So if you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But can and should are different things, right? And- and I'm asking this--",
      "JAMIESON GREER: --But to- to go- but- but listen, if you're going to sanction somebody and essentially prohibit trade, you almost certainly can do something that's softer, which is to allow the trade and just put a tariff on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Brazil, because the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. That means, you know, we sell them more than we buy from them. So it doesn't seem to be consistent here, when you have the President put 50% tariffs on Brazil, one of the highest of any countries. And at the same time, the President is bringing up things that have nothing to do with trade when he's justifying them. He sent a letter to the current government complaining about the prosecution of his ally, Bolsonaro, who is- who allegedly staged a coup when he lost the last election. The President called it a witch hunt. This seems politically motivated and not about trade.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, two things. First of all, there's a 10% tariff on Brazil because we have a surplus with them. That's the reciprocal tariff. And then there's a 40% tariff that the President has chosen to do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, like we would do any sanction where we see geopolitical issues. The President has seen in Brazil, like he's seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy, what one might call lawfare. It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues. I mean, sanctions, we've been using them for years with all kinds of countries, including countries we like--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You view tariffs and sanctions as the same?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: They're just different in degree. I mean, tariffs are actually lighter than a sanction- a sanction, you're cutting off a country from your financial system. You're prohibiting trade with them. A tariff, you're allowing trade. You're just putting a fee on it. It's a- it's a lesser",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: step than sanctions--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You- you have moved far away from from dealing with the deficit. Now--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --Well the deficit has a 10% tariff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --you are talking about politically motivated trade actions here. I mean, the president sent a letter to President Lula, saying that tariffs are due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections. He also, at the same time, sanctioned the Supreme Court justice overseeing Bolsonaro's trial. Why are you trying to influence a criminal trial of an ally of President Trump?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so, so the president of United States, historically, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, they have used IEEPA to impose sanctions for all kinds of geopolitical reasons in all kinds of countries. Sometimes it's countrywide, sometimes it's specific to certain, you know, individuals and often foreign leaders and foreign officials. So this is not, this is not way outside the market. If anything, the President could have gone farther in the type of sanction that was used. Instead he just used a tariff instead of cutting them off from the financial system altogether.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were fully on board with it. It sounds like.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: With the president of the United States? My boss? Of course I am--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But with intervening in criminal trials--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --when the President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- through trade policy.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: When the President sees lawfare going on, he's going to impose a sanction through IEEPA that's been delegated by Congress. That's his job as the president. He's elected to assess the Foreign Affairs situation in the United States and take appropriate action. There's just no question that it's both from a legal perspective, it's completely permissible. And from a policy perspective, that's what he's elected to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to trade, the big deal that is pending out there is how is the president going to deal with China? There's an August 12 deadline, and if that deadline is not met, you have said tariff levels could snap back to above 80%. Is that deadline going to slide?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So that's what's under discussion right now. I would say that our conversations with the Chinese have been very positive. We have discussions at the staff level, at my level, you know, President Xi and President Trump have had conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said that it's sliding. The Chinese said it's sliding.",

      "The Perseids peak in 2025 is Aug. 12-13, specifically early next Wednesday for those in North America. At that time, the moon will be 84% full, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",
      "A planetarium program coordinator at a museum in St. Paul, Minnesota, is advising people to instead go out a week or so past the peak when the moon isn't so bright.",
      "The Perseids \"are an incredible meteor shower,\" Thaddeus LaCoursiere, of the Bell Museum, told The Associated Press.",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before the sun comes up, in the Northern Hemisphere. However, meteors sometimes can be seen as early as 10 p.m.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "During peak, next Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the Earth will pass closest to the core orbit of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, Lunsford writes.",
      "\"To view the Perseids successfully, it is suggested you watch from a safe rural area that is as dark as possible,\" he says. \"The more stars you can see, the more meteors will also be visible.\"",

    "summary": "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, NOAA forecasters updated their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect.",
    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, a combination of factors influence the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to\u00a0prepare.",
      "\"NOAA stands ready to provide the forecasts and warnings that are vital for safeguarding lives, property, and communities,\" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement Thursday. \"As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "Researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "They also recently updated their predictions, now estimating that eight hurricanes will occur over the course of the 2025 season with 16 named storms overall.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",

      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "As part of the new model, OpenAI is also reigning in ChatGPT's flattery. In its blog post, the company said GPT\u20115 is \"less effusively agreeable\" and that it will use \"fewer unnecessary emojis.\"",

      "Altman called the new chatbot's ability to write code on demand its \"superpower,\" adding that the advancement would have been \"unimaginable at any previous point in history.\"",
      "Asked about how the technology might impact the livelihood of human programmers, Altman said he thought the technology would actually create more job opportunities for as demand for software rises.",

    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.",
      "Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said.",
      "\"It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up,\" lead author David Horner, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a news release.",
      "Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about six hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged three hours a day.",
      "They also found sleep impacted the results, with both less sleep and later bedtimes amplifying the relationship between screen time and heart health risks. That suggests screen time may harm health by \"stealing\" time from sleep, they said.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead the IRS temporarily, the official said. President Trump is expected to nominate Long for an ambassadorship.",
      "The news was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Long was confirmed by the Senate in mid-June and took over the IRS after some tumult for the tax collection agency's leadership. The IRS has had several interim commissioners since Mr. Trump's return to office in January, including one who lasted for just 48 hours. The Trump administration has aimed to dramatically trim the agency's workforce.",
      "A former auctioneer and Missouri Republican congressman, Long was chosen to take over the IRS late last year after previously pushing to repeal much of the tax code during his time in the House. Long isn't an accountant by trade, but Mr. Trump touted his time as a tax adviser. After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",
      "The IRS has been a focus of the Trump administration's government-wide staff cuts. The agency drew up plans earlier this year to cut its 102,000-person workforce by as much as 40% through a combination of layoffs and voluntary resignations, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The cuts were set to begin after April 15, which is the deadline for most Americans to file their taxes.",
      "As of May, some 25,000 staffers had left the IRS, a 25% decrease from February levels, according to a report by the IRS's internal watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Around 26% of the IRS's revenue agents \u2014 the staff who conduct audits \u2014 had left the agency by May, the report found.",
      "Meanwhile, staff from the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 a cost-cutting team once led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 sought access to the IRS's tax data system, sparking a lawsuit.",
      "Former IRS acting head Melanie Krause left the agency in April over a plan to share tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help identify undocumented immigrants. She was replaced by Gary Shapley, a longtime IRS agent who became well-known for speaking about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax investigation. But Shapley was ousted after just two days following a dispute between Musk and Bessent.",
      "Bessent complained to Mr. Trump that Shapley had been installed at the urging of Musk and sought the president's approval to undo the decision, multiple sources told CBS News at the time.",

    "story": [
      "The watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund, led by a former Obama administration ethics official, has formally requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a Qatari luxury jet on behalf of President Trump.",
      "According to a memo obtained by CBS News, the group asked the Department of Defense's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office to probe whether the Pentagon broke laws and engaged in impropriety by accepting the gift on Mr. Trump's behalf from the Qatari royal family. The memo was sent to the inspector general and GAO on Friday.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund is a nonpartisan advocacy group founded by Obama ethics czar Norm Eisen. Its memo said the agencies should investigate whether the Defense Department had improperly invoked its authorities to accept the jet aircraft and to reportedly transfer $934 million in funding from a nuclear missile program to help retrofit the aircraft.",
      "\"If true, this would mean that the DoD is diverting critical nuclear defense funds to outfit an unprecedented gift from a foreign government to a U.S. president,\" the group said in a 10-page memo.",
      "Earlier this year,\u00a0President Trump confirmed\u00a0that the Qatari royal family was donating a Boeing 747-8 for his use. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet is set to be donated to Mr. Trump's presidential library after his term is over.",
      "\"There are so many things wrong with this picture, it's a challenge to know where to begin,\" said Virginia Canter, chief counsel for ethics and anti-corruption at Democracy Defenders Fund. \"The fact that taxpayers are now funding a fifth Air Force One, originating from a foreign monarchy, is a staggering abuse of public trust, fiscal priorities, and national security interests,\" Canter said.",
      "The memo from Democracy Defenders Fund said the jet was redundant and unnecessary, pointing out the U.S. Air Force operates two 747 jets as Air Force One, and two replacement aircraft were authorized in 2018 for $3.9 billion. Despite the existence of both an active and future fleet, Mr. Trump pursued the $400 million Qatari plane, which he referred to in May as a \"gift.\"",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" the president said.",
      "The memo from the Democracy Defenders Fund also argued that Justice Department guidance prohibits agencies from accepting gifts that would incur costs in future fiscal years, as appears to be the case with the Qatari jet.",
      "\"The Air Force has already made clear that the Qatari jet is not able to operate as Air Force One in its current state,\" the memo said.",
      "The group also argued that even if it were legal, \"the use of the (Defense Department's) statutory authority to accept a foreign gift that is not fit for purpose and then expend a billion dollars from appropriations for nuclear deterrence to upgrade that plane would be wasteful, a gross mismanagement of funds and an abuse of the (Defense Department's) statutory authorities in support of the President's attempt to evade Constitutional restrictions on acceptance of foreign emoluments.\"",
      "A memorandum of understanding between Qatar and the Defense Department that was viewed by CBS News outlined the \"unconditional donation\" of one Boeing 747-8 jumbo aircraft.",
      "It was signed earlier this month by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Qatar's deputy prime minister and minister of state for defense affairs. It does not specifically mention Air Force One but says the jet can be used by the Pentagon \"in any manner it deems appropriate.\"",

      "Andrew Chaikin, author of the 2007 book \"A Man on the Moon\" on the Apollo program, told CBS News that Lovell had some of the most memorable comments during the Apollo 8 TV transmissions. He recalled that Lovell called Earth a \"grand oasis in the vastness of space.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:53:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists caution new tariffs could pose economic risks, but the White House says growth is rebounding amid low inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Some economists are cautioning that President Trump's sweeping new tariffs on U.S. trade partners, which took effect Thursday, increase the risks that the U.S. economy could enter a period of stagflation.",
      "A mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation,\" the term describes periods marked by high prices and low GDP growth, such as the economic doldrums of the 1970s. To be sure, U.S. economic growth, though\u00a0slower so far this year than in 2024, remains relatively strong, and inflation remains far below its post-pandemic spike.",
      "But economists are flagging the potential for fresh tariffs, which\u00a0took effect Aug. 7,to fuel higher prices as businesses pass on the costs of the new import duties to consumers. With the latest round of import duties, the effective average tariff rate now stands at 18%, the highest since 1934, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Inflation likely rose 2.8% on an annual basis in July, inching higher from the 2.7% annual rate notched in the prior month, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. July data for the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Aug. 12.",
      "\"The stagflation theme in markets is intensifying,\" Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a research note Thursday.",
      "While prices likely crept higher last month, they're still nowhere near the post-pandemic price spike that financially hobbled many households. Yet an increase would represent a reversal of a downward trend earlier this year, and push the inflation rate farther from the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "The economy could face another hit from tariffs if some U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the import duties to the federal government, scale back hiring or expansion plans to cope with those higher costs, economists added. Last week's disappointing employment report suggested the U.S. job market is starting to wobble from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs, they noted.",
      "\"To offset internal costs, you may look at reducing your workforce and curbing wage growth to offset part of the cost of goods increase,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "U.S. GDP is also forecast to slow throughout 2025, with economists polled by FactSet pegging this year's growth at 1.5%, down from 2.4% in 2024.",
      "The White House took issue with concerns raised by some economists about the potential for stagflation. \"Inflation continuing to remain cool and growth rebounding in Q2 both suggest stagflation is simply the latest buzzword for panican paranoia,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Panican\" is a term coined by Mr. Trump earlier this year to refer to the fears expressed by some critics about his tariffs.",
      "A challenging scenario",
      "The U.S. economy is facing a challenging scenario from the combination of a weaker job market and higher inflation, Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a monetary policy research institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The U.S. economy appears to be hitting a mild form of stagflation,\" Amarnath said. \"I'd call it stagflation lite.\"",
      "The dangers of higher inflation and a weaker job market were highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month when he discussed the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Powell pointed out that job creation has slowed, adding risks to the labor market, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual goal.",
      "The Fed has a dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low. Achieving those goals requires different strategies, however. Because high interest rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, the Fed tends to hike rates to fight inflation.",
      "But when unemployment spikes, the Fed typically cuts its benchmark rate to make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage businesses to hire and expand.",
      "\"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" Powell said at a July 30 press conference.",
      "He added that the Fed is \"trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation because you're being pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in.\"",
      "With the job market now showing signs of stress, the challenge is whether the Fed should cut rates, or hold off because inflation remains higher than the central bank's goal \u2014 and is projected to inch higher, Slok noted.",
      "The manufacturing, retail, wholesale and construction industries, which are sensitive to the impact of tariffs, all notched fewer job gains than were initially reported, with the July jobs report's revisions. Manufacturing jobs declined for three consecutive months from May through July, the data shows.",
      "\"That's consistent with a level of uncertainty on the trade side depressing the willingness to hire,\" Amarnath said.",
      "At the same time, \"goods prices have picked up speed,\" he added. \"Household supplies and furniture, apparel and used cars are all starting to see upward momentum, and I think tariffs are an obvious reason for that.\"",

      "The award, the Order of Lenin, was meant to be handed off to Juliane Gallina, whose 21-year-old son, Michael Gloss, was killed in 2024.",
      "Gallina is currently serving at the CIA as deputy director for digital innovation. It could not be immediately determined what was done with the award.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News that Putin gave Witkoff the award during his trip to Russia this week, which a Russian official said the U.S. initiated, to discuss ending the Ukraine war.",
      "The gesture by Putin, known for mind games and attempts to expose adversaries' points of weakness, was likely meant to raise unhelpful questions and highlight that a CIA official's son fought for Russia in the war.",
      "In a statement in April, CIA officials said the death of Gallina's son, who struggled with mental health challenges, was not a national security issue. Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News there was no indication that Gloss had been recruited by the Russian government, and that the Kremlin did not appear to be aware of Gloss's family background when it repatriated his remains.",
      "Spokespeople for the White House, the CIA and Witkoff didn't respond with comment for this article. A Russian embassy spokesman contacted by CBS News said there was no official comment, and no acknowledgement of the award has been publicly disclosed by the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry.",
      "Putin's move comes at a sensitive time, as Mr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Kremlin and has vowed secondary tariffs starting on Friday, even as negotiations are underway for a possible summit.",
      "The Order of Lenin is a Soviet-era award meant to highlight outstanding civilian service. It has been given to high-level spies, including the U.K.'s Kim Philby, a double agent for the Soviet Union. Gallina's son was never an employee of the CIA, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Putin, a former KGB operative, has met five times with Witkoff, who left real estate development to become Mr. Trump's envoy for sensitive peace missions. Witkoff's reliance in the past on Russian government translators during high-stakes diplomacy has drawn scrutiny.",
      "A source familiar with the talks told CBS News that Witkoff had a U.S. government translator with him for the encounter on Wednesday, two days before Mr. Trump's deadline for Putin to end the war or face severe financial penalties via sanctions. That same day, the Trump administration put an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods to punish New Delhi for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Mr. Trump described the Wednesday meeting in Moscow as \"highly productive.\" The White House said the Russians were eager to continue engaging with the United States and said that secondary sanctions were due to be implemented on Friday. However, as of Friday afternoon, no such sanctions had been issued.",
      "On social media, Gloss published posts of himself in Moscow and voiced his support for Russian troops. Russian media first published news of Gloss' death in April. The CIA's statement at the time said Gallina and her family had suffered \"an unimaginable personal tragedy.\"",
      "An obituary for Gloss said he was \"tragically killed in Eastern Europe\" on April 4, 2024.",
      "Gloss's father, Larry Gloss, an Iraq War veteran, told the Washington Post in an interview that he and Gallina did not know their son was in Ukraine or that he had enlisted in the Russian army.",

      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",

      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",

      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",

      "The Perseids meteor shower \u2014 considered one of the best shows in the sky \u2014 is set to peak next week. But the peak for fireballs shooting through the night sky coincides this year with a bright moon that is expected to negatively impact visibility for eager viewers.",
      "The Perseids peak in 2025 is Aug. 12-13, specifically early next Wednesday for those in North America. At that time, the moon will be 84% full, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",
      "A planetarium program coordinator at a museum in St. Paul, Minnesota, is advising people to instead go out a week or so past the peak when the moon isn't so bright.",
      "The Perseids \"are an incredible meteor shower,\" Thaddeus LaCoursiere, of the Bell Museum, told The Associated Press.",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before the sun comes up, in the Northern Hemisphere. However, meteors sometimes can be seen as early as 10 p.m.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "During peak, next Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the Earth will pass closest to the core orbit of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, Lunsford writes.",
      "\"To view the Perseids successfully, it is suggested you watch from a safe rural area that is as dark as possible,\" he says. \"The more stars you can see, the more meteors will also be visible.\"",

    "story": [
      "Four shipwrecks\u00a0\u2014 including the remains believed to be a 1748 Spanish privateer ship \u2014 were recently found at a historical site in North Carolina.",
      "A team of archeologists with East Carolina University's program in maritime studies was searching the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site in Brunswick County, North Carolina, in May and June when they made the discoveries.",
      "In a statement, the university said the team collected wood samples that suggest the shipbuilders incorporated raw materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies in the 18th century. The team said that while more work is needed to confirm any identification of the remains, they believe they may be those of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer from Cuba that exploded near the colonial wharves during an attack on the port at the end of King George's War in September 1748.",
      "\"I came across several wooden frames barely sticking out of the clay mud with evidence of planking just barely visible on the surface,\" maritime studies graduate student Cory van Hees, who was part of the discovery, said in the press release. \"I didn't understand what I was looking at in that moment, but I knew I should relay the wooden structure to faculty.\"",
      "He added, \"Later that day, Dr. Jason Raupp was able to confirm this was a wreck, which may be La Fortuna. It was kind of overwhelming and a little emotional feeling once it set in.\"",
      "The ship was involved in an attack that took place during King George's War between 1744 and 1748 \u2014 several decades before the American Revolution.",
      "According to ECU, the wreck lies in proximity to where an 18th-century cannon thought to be from La Fortuna was recovered in 1985.",
      "More than 40 pieces of timber from what is thought to be La Fortuna were collected as part of an \"emergency recovery\" to save the ship's remains from advancing erosion and other threats, university officials said.",
      "\"The shipwreck sites and colonial waterfront features previously covered beneath the protective marsh were found exposed and eroded in this area,\" officials said. \"Although the site itself had broken apart, individual shipwreck timbers demonstrated a remarkable degree of preservation with some containing tool markings left by the historic shipwright.\"",
      "All the collected timber was transferred to the North Carolina Office of State Archaeology's Queen Anne's Revenge Conservation Laboratory at ECU's campus in Greenville for storage and eventual conservation treatment.",
      "\"The successful recovery of the possible La Fortuna shipwreck and documentation of heritage at risk within a nationally significant historic site demonstrates the effectiveness of the collaborative efforts of the research team,\" said Dr. Jason Raupp, assistant professor in the Department of History and maritime studies, who led the team.",
      "Additional discoveries",
      "The remains of three other shipwrecks were uncovered at the historic site's waterfront along the Cape Fear River.",
      "Preliminary analysis suggests that one was used for land reclamation at the waterfront, while another is a potential colonial flatboat, which was historically used to transport people and goods between the port and nearby plantations, the university said. The fourth was barely exposed and its remains are still unidentified.",
      "\"Additional colonial port infrastructure and artifacts identified through the field schools include two timber-crib wharves, a causeway over the historic marsh, and numerous artifacts that shed light on colonial life, trade, maritime activity and military conflict at the historic site,\" the university said.",
      "\"We are extremely excited about these important sites, as each one will help us to better understand the role of BTFA as one of the state's earliest colonial port towns,\" Raupp said in a statement. \"These submerged colonial waterfront features are incredibly well-preserved and present an excellent opportunity for ECU students to engage in hands-on, collaborative research.\"",

      "\"At the same time,\" he added, \"there's no question the vehicle emissions regulations finalized under the previous administration aren't achievable and should be revised to reflect current market conditions, to keep the auto industry in America competitive, and to keep the industry on a path of vehicle choice and lower emissions.\"",
      "A spokesperson from the EPA said Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks and that the agency's proposal to revoke the endangerment finding \"does not prohibit vehicle manufacturers from developing EVs or different vehicles.\"",
      "Focus on consumer demand",
      "Experts say that even amid a shifting regulatory landscape, consumer preference will continue to drive auto makers' decisions.",
      "\"Their focus is going to be on making vehicles more affordable and dealing with the fact that consumers, not the government, are standing in the way of the mass adoption for EVs,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group.",
      "The rate of electric vehicle adoption has been steady over the last several years, although the majority of Americans still fuel their cars at the pump. Demand for the vehicles has waned over the last year, according to data on light vehicle registration from S&P Global Mobility. From January to May, the electric vehicle market share was 7.3%, compared with 8% for the entire year of 2024, data from the auto intelligence provider shows.",
      "But while consumer demand may have stalled slightly over the past year, auto makers will still want to offer low-emissions products in order to stay competitive both at home and abroad, Ivan Drury, director of insights at online car marketplace Edmunds, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Every auto maker is a global competitor, and even though they might not be selling as well here, they could sell elsewhere better,\" he said.",
      "Impact would take time",
      "Experts say the proposal, if passed, wouldn't drastically change any near-term plans of auto makers, given the time and money they have already invested in their product lines.",
      "\"If had already planned to build X number of this kind of vehicle, you can change that, but not necessarily tomorrow,\" said Brinley. \"So that's gonna have to be planned out.\"",
      "Product development cycles at car manufacturers span five to 10 years, according to a report from Eurasia Group, a global research firm.",
      "The exact strategy and speed with which companies make changes would vary from auto maker to auto maker, according to experts. \"For now, auto makers would enjoy the flexibility and lower costs from less stringent emissions limits, particularly in their nonelectric fleet planning,\" the report from Eurasia says.",
      "There are concerns among some companies that the EPA's proposal, if passed, would inject a degree of chaos into industry, David Victor, a professor at University of California San Diego, told CBS MoneyWatch. Also, the rule-making process will likely be challenged in the courts, he said.",
      "\"[Auto makers] will not get a reliable new set of rules anytime soon,\" said Victor.",

He said he thinks kratom products are too accessible and lack proper warnings on their labels.",
      "The FDA has warned consumers not to use kratom, citing risks including substance use disorder, seizures and even death, primarily when mixed with other substances like alcohol.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled in April that probable cause existed to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over its removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A divided federal appeals court on Friday granted the Trump administration's request to set aside a district judge's decision\u00a0finding probable cause\u00a0that some federal officials committed criminal contempt by violating an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador.",
      "The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a massive victory for the Trump administration, which has lambasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for overstepping his authority when he initiated criminal contempt proceedings in April.",
      "The D.C. Circuit had issued a temporary pause of Boasberg's decision while it took more time to consider the issue. In an unsigned opinion issued Friday, Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both appointed by President Trump in his first term, granted a request from the Justice Department to toss out Boasberg's contempt order. Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act case",
      "The dispute over Boasberg's contempt order stems from immigration officials' efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, which President Trump invoked in March to swiftly remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "In response to a fast-moving legal challenge brought by a group of migrants in Washington, D.C., over the removals, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and issued an oral order directing the Trump administration to return Venezuelan migrants subject to Mr. Trump's declaration who were on planes bound for El Salvador back to the U.S. A written order issued shortly after prevented the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "But Boasberg said that despite his injunctions, the Trump administration did not stop the removals, and the planes carrying the migrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act landed in El Salvador. The planes were already outside U.S. airspace when Boasberg issued his order blocking U.S. officials from \"removing\" the detainees, a fact that the appeals court noted in ruling for the administration. Most of the people were transferred to El Salvador's notorious supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "The administration's actions raised questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order, and the judge in April ruled that probable cause existed to find government officials in criminal contempt over what he was their defiance. Boasberg said the government's actions demonstrated a \"willful disregard\" for his order.",
      "\"The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,\" Boasberg wrote in his decision. He said the Trump administration could remedy his contempt findings by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of his order, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's contempt finding and asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the decision, which it then agreed to do.",
      "In a concurring opinion on Friday, Katsas wrote that the dispute over the removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March \"involves an extraordinary, ongoing confrontation between the Executive and Judicial Branches.\" He noted that the proceedings do not involve the lawfulness of removals made under the Alien Enemies Act in March, and said the court may not decide at this time \"whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter.\"",
      "Still, Katsas wrote that a decision in favor of the Trump administration is appropriate because \"the government is plainly correct about the merits of the criminal contempt, and our saying so now would prevent long disputes between the Executive and the Judiciary over difficult, contentious issues regarding the courts' power to control foreign policy or prosecutions, or to impose criminal sanctions for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.\"",
      "\"In circumstances much less fraught than these, courts have reviewed interlocutory orders through mandamus to prevent extended inter-branch conflict,\" Katsas said.",
      "He wrote that Boasberg's contempt finding \"raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses.\"",
      "In her dissent, Pillard argued that Boasberg's contempt findings were appropriate, and said the majority's decision to throw out the contempt findings was \"in error.\"",
      "\"Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,\" Pillar wrote. \"When it appears that a judicial order has been disobeyed, the court's ability to learn who was responsible is the first step to accountability.\"",
      "Since Boasberg's findings and the appeals court's stay of his order, 252 Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to CECOT were sent from El Salvador back to their home country as part of a prisoner swap involving the U.S.",
      "Tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary have escalated across Mr. Trump's second term, as judges have issued decisions blocking implementation of many aspects of the president's agenda. But the clash between Boasberg and the president has been one of the most fierce, and the judge's contempt finding marked the most direct rebuke of the administration so far.",
      "Mr. Trump has called for Congress to impeach Boasberg, and the Justice Department filed a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge over comments he allegedly made at a closed-door meeting of the Judicial Conference in March.",

      "White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly, while not confirming the reports, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"top priority is protecting the homeland, which is why he took the bold step to designate several cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin gave President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff an award to pass along to a senior CIA official whose son was killed in Ukraine while fighting alongside Russian forces, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The award, the Order of Lenin, was meant to be handed off to Juliane Gallina, whose 21-year-old son, Michael Gloss, was killed in 2024.",
      "Gallina is currently serving at the CIA as deputy director for digital innovation. It could not be immediately determined what was done with the award.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News that Putin gave Witkoff the award during his trip to Russia this week, which a Russian official said the U.S. initiated, to discuss ending the Ukraine war.",
      "The gesture by Putin, known for mind games and attempts to expose adversaries' points of weakness, was likely meant to raise unhelpful questions and highlight that a CIA official's son fought for Russia in the war.",
      "In a statement in April, CIA officials said the death of Gallina's son, who struggled with mental health challenges, was not a national security issue. Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News there was no indication that Gloss had been recruited by the Russian government, and that the Kremlin did not appear to be aware of Gloss's family background when it repatriated his remains.",
      "Spokespeople for the White House, the CIA and Witkoff didn't respond with comment for this article. A Russian embassy spokesman contacted by CBS News said there was no official comment, and no acknowledgement of the award has been publicly disclosed by the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry.",
      "Putin's move comes at a sensitive time, as Mr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Kremlin and has vowed secondary tariffs starting on Friday, even as negotiations are underway for a possible summit.",
      "The Order of Lenin is a Soviet-era award meant to highlight outstanding civilian service. It has been given to high-level spies, including the U.K.'s Kim Philby, a double agent for the Soviet Union. Gallina's son was never an employee of the CIA, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Putin, a former KGB operative, has met five times with Witkoff, who left real estate development to become Mr. Trump's envoy for sensitive peace missions. Witkoff's reliance in the past on Russian government translators during high-stakes diplomacy has drawn scrutiny.",
      "A source familiar with the talks told CBS News that Witkoff had a U.S. government translator with him for the encounter on Wednesday, two days before Mr. Trump's deadline for Putin to end the war or face severe financial penalties via sanctions. That same day, the Trump administration put an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods to punish New Delhi for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Mr. Trump described the Wednesday meeting in Moscow as \"highly productive.\" The White House said the Russians were eager to continue engaging with the United States and said that secondary sanctions were due to be implemented on Friday. However, as of Friday afternoon, no such sanctions had been issued.",
      "On social media, Gloss published posts of himself in Moscow and voiced his support for Russian troops. Russian media first published news of Gloss' death in April. The CIA's statement at the time said Gallina and her family had suffered \"an unimaginable personal tragedy.\"",
      "An obituary for Gloss said he was \"tragically killed in Eastern Europe\" on April 4, 2024.",
      "Gloss's father, Larry Gloss, an Iraq War veteran, told the Washington Post in an interview that he and Gallina did not know their son was in Ukraine or that he had enlisted in the Russian army.",
      "\"Our biggest fear while we were waiting for him to be repatriated was that someone over there [in Moscow] would put two and two together and figure out who his mother was, and use him as a prop,\" Larry Gloss said.",

      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced.

      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name.

      "In a wide-ranging interview with CBS News, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said it'll be up to the Israeli government to decide whether to fully take over the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\" Huckabee said. \"Certainly, if they ask for wisdom, counsel, advice, I'm sure the president would offer it. But ultimately, it's the decision that the Israelis and only the Israelis can make.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News in an interview Thursday that Israel intends to take control of all of Gaza, but not to govern it. He said Israel does not want to \"keep\" Gaza, but instead \"hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly.\"",
      "Later on Thursday, Netanyahu was expected to discuss plans with senior ministers for the Israeli military to take control of more of Gaza's territory.",
      "When asked what advice President Trump might offer, Huckabee said: \"I remember him saying that, 'I know what I would do, but I'm not sure anybody else would do it.' I think we got the inference of: It would not be good for Hamas.\"",
      "The group representing families of the hostages and the missing abducted during the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack called on Israelis Wednesday to march to the headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces in response to \"recent statements about occupying the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "\"Time is running out \u2014 our loved ones can't wait any longer. We either bring them home now, or we lose them for good,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement, calling for a single deal for every remaining hostage to be released. \"There are moments in history when we must stand up and do what's right \u2014 this is that moment.\"",
      "On negotiations for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire",
      "Negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas broke down in recent weeks, with each side accusing the other of being responsible for the talks' failure.",
      "\"I think the negotiations have broken down completely because Hamas is not serious about negotiating,\" Huckabee said. \"I'm not sure they ever were, but they certainly aren't anymore. Europe has given them some cover. When European leaders are putting more pressure on Israel than they are Hamas \u2014 and they're talking about people in Gaza, and they're not talking about the hostages \u2014 Hamas is celebrating, and they're realizing that, you know, they're winning the message war here.\"",
      "Huckabee said he wasn't sure there was a way to revive the ceasefire negotiations.",
      "\"I think the alternative is to recognize that they understand one thing: They lose,\" Huckabee said. \"They have to be defeated. And President Trump has repeatedly said Hamas has no future in Gaza and they can't lead it. I think that's exactly right.\"",
      "On American citizens killed in the occupied West Bank",
      "Six Americans have been killed in the occupied West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023, allegedly by Israeli settlers, including 20-year-old Saifullah Kamel Musallet.",
      "Huckabee said he has \"asked for, and we'll continue to demand, a full-throated investigation of what happened, who did it.\"",
      "He said investigators had gotten Musallet's medical records around a week ago.",
      "\"He's an American citizen. I went and visited with his family and his home \u2014 committed to the family: We will do everything we can to find out who did it,\" Huckabee said.",
      "40-year-old Khamis al-Ayyad, also an American citizen, recently died after trying to put out fires set to homes and cars by Israeli settlers near his home in the West Bank, his family said.",
      "Huckabee told CBS News the exact details of al-Ayyad's death were not yet clear.",
      "\"It's not always simple to get the full cooperation from all the authorities, because you're dealing with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities, so that's part of the challenge that we face. It takes more time than I wish it did. But we certainly are asking a lot of questions about who did this. What are the pieces of evidence? We want to be able to serve the families that, as an American citizen, that's important to us,\" Huckabee said.",
      "On reports of starvation in Gaza and getting aid to its population",
      "Mr. Trump said in July that the children in Gaza \"look very hungry. That's real starvation stuff,\" amid warnings of famine in Gaza from international humanitarian groups. Aid agencies have been calling for a surge of aid to the strip.",
      "\"I think that there are certainly people suffering in Gaza. Part of the reason is because you've had pallets and trucks for food that the U.N. won't take in \u2014 because they say they don't want military escort from the IDF \u2014 but they say it's not safe,\" Huckabee said. \"There's not been a lack of food or even a lack of attempt. It's been an inefficient way of getting it and it's been a problem because you have a terror organization who is stealing it, looting it, and then turning around and selling it to the people who are hungry.\"",
      "Desperate and starving people have been looting food trucks when they enter Gaza, but the World Food Program told CBS News there is no evidence food aid is being diverted to Hamas.",
      "\"I'm shocked they would say that,\" Huckabee said.",
      "Huckabee said food distribution sites run by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were proving effective in delivering aid to Palestinians in Gaza, and that the number of sites would be scaled up from four to 16, with the hubs potentially staying open 24 hours a day.",
      "According to the U.N., over 1,400 people have been killed trying to get food aid in Gaza, most of them, it says, as a result of IDF fire. Nearly 900 Palestinians have been killed near GHF sites.",
      "Throughout their months in operation, GHF sites have become flashpoints of desperation, with videos showing mass crowds of people gathering outside who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, and the GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to control crowds.",
      "\"We've had reports that there have been incidences, but forgive me if I'm a little skeptical when someone says these people are being killed at the job site,\" Huckabee said. \"If there was some random shooting of people who were coming for food, those people would face severe consequences.\"",
      "On a two-state solution and what happens after the Israel-Hamas war",
      "Huckabee said that what happens to Palestinians living in Gaza after the war ends \"may depend on them \u2014 how many of them want to stay and rebuild their lives. We talked to some last week, and that's what they really want to do,\" Huckabee said.",
      "\"They know it's going to take years to rebuild their homes, their businesses, their families. They have their own vision for what that's going to look like. But there are undoubtedly many people who live there now who would love a way to leave and go somewhere else.\"",
      "Huckabee said no one should be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "\"They shouldn't be forced out. Nobody should be required to leave. And it's interesting that while there have been allegations that people are going to be forced out, both the U.S. and the government of Israel has been very clear: Nobody's going to be forced out, at least not by the U.S. And Israel has said it doesn't plan to force people to leave, but it wants people to have the freedom to start over, make a new life away from Gaza and away from the horrific memories they have that were inflicted upon them.\"",
      "When asked about whether he supported a two-state solution \u2014 the long-standing U.S. policy toward the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 Huckabee said, \"It's really not an ambassador's position to make the decision of what that policy would be.\"",
      "\"It's sort of an aspirational goal: 'We need a two-state solution,'\" Huckabee said. \"But when you start asking people the specifics of what it looks like and where it's going to be. What are the boundaries? It's interesting that very few people have an answer for that.\"",

      "There have been a series of conflicts between the two neighbors over the past three decades, most recently in 2023, when Azerbaijan\u00a0launched an offensive in a disputed region that caused tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians to flee. A\u00a0ceasefire in September 2023 averted a wider war, and the countries concluded talks over a peace treaty in March. But talks aimed at cementing the deal have\u00a0stalled in the months since, with negotiations in Abu Dhabi in July failing to lead to a breakthrough.",
      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff traveled to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, in March. Aryeh Lightstone, former CEO of the Abraham Accords Peace Institute, has made multiple trips to the region as part of peace deal talks. The Trump administration has said an Azerbaijan peace deal with its neighbor is necessary before it can join the Abraham Accords, as part of a plan to expand that agreement beyond the Arab countries that signed up to it in 2020 when they recognized Israel.",
      "Entry into the accords isn't expected on Friday, sources said. Both Witkoff and Lightstone are expected to be at Friday's summit.",
      "Azerbaijan also borders Russia, and has the potential to send oil and gas into Ukraine without going through Russia. The peace pact will open routes for goods to travel to the West without crossing Russia \u2014 or Iran, sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump has privately expressed interest in a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in brokering peace agreements, sources have said, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said it's \"well past time\" that he be awarded one.",
      "\"We stopped a lot of countries from war \u2014 India and Pakistan. We stopped a lot of countries,\" he said Sunday. \"You heard about Cambodia and Thailand. We got that one done. We got the Congo, which was going on for 31 years \u2014 Rwanda, that one's done. We stopped a lot of wars.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "On Aug. 6, 1945, the Enola Gay B-29 Superfortress bomber delivered its payload, dubbed Little Boy, onto the unsuspecting civilians of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb \u2014 nicknamed Fat Man \u2014 fell on Nagasaki. The bombing led to the Japanese official surrender in World War II on Sept. 2, 1945.",
      "By the end of 1945, about 210,000 people, mostly Japanese civilians and forced Korean laborers, had died. Some perished instantly in the blasts, others died later on from radiation poisoning. Pregnant women lost children in the aftermath, and thousands more civilians would fall victim to cancers and other side effects over the following decades.",
      "Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only two cities ever to be targeted by nuclear weapons. Tanaka, who was just 6 years old when the bomb fell, told CBS News in 2020 that both remain scarred by the horrors unleashed by President Harry S. Truman and the scientists of the Manhattan Project in the early hours of that quiet August morning.",
      "Bombing of Hiroshima",
      "In the wake of Little Boy's devastation, a\u00a0 stone building, five stories tall with blown-out windows and a crumbling roof, remained standing, despite its proximity to the bomb's hypocenter and the vaporization of everyone inside.",
      "Then known as the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the building was gutted by the blast, but its ashen steel dome, which shouldered the brunt of the overhead explosion, endured as a symbol of the city's resilience. Today, the structure is a part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.",
      "The atomic detonation, and ensuing firestorm, destroyed or heavily damaged 60,000 buildings in Hiroshima\u2014two-thirds of the city's total structures. This image, taken by U.S. military reconnaissance, shows the city before and after the Enola Gay flew overhead.",
      "Three years after the bomb fell, Hiroshima still resembled a wasteland of crooked steel and charred rubble. This photo, dated 1948, shows how life was beginning to sprout from the desolation, with a handful of buildings dotting the ruined landscape.",
      "Today, Hiroshima is a booming metropolis of 1.2 million people\u2014nearly 3.5\u00a0 times larger than the city's estimated 1945 population of 350,000. After the bombing, the population had cratered to around 83,000.",
      "Bombing of Nagasaki",
      "Nagasaki saw less overall destruction than Hiroshima, primarily due to the city's geography and urban design. Still, 14,000 structures \u201427% of all buildings in the city\u2014 were destroyed when Fat Man detonated above Nagasaki. Only 12% of the regional capital's structures remained undamaged when the dust settled on the Southern Japanese island.",
      "By 1948, Nagasaki had been slow to recover. Temporary structures had started to emerge a year after the bombing, but citywide rebuilding wouldn't begin until the passage of the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law in 1949. Three years after nuclear weapons were deployed, charred tree trunks, stripped of their branches, stood near a sacred Torii Gate that survived the blast.",
      "Today, Nagasaki is home to nearly 400,000 people, up from the estimated 263,000 that called the city home 80 years ago.",

      "On Wednesday, at a ceremony marking 80 years since the bombing, Hiroshima mayor Kazumi Matsui said that those conflicts \"threaten to topple the peacebuilding frameworks so many have worked so hard to build\"",
      "\"Policymakers in some countries even accept the idea that nuclear weapons are essential for national defense.

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Wednesday, days before the White House's deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or potentially face severe economic penalties that could also hit countries buying its oil.",
      "The meeting lasted about three hours, Russian state media said. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said that Putin and Witkoff had a \"useful and constructive conversation\" that focused on the Ukrainian crisis and, in a nod toward improving relations between Washington and Moscow, \"prospects for possible development of strategic cooperation between the U.S. and Russia.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that the meeting was \"highly productive.\"",
      "\"Great progress was made! Afterwards, I updated some of our European Allies. Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,\" the president said.",
      "Before the meeting with Putin, Witkoff took an early morning stroll through Zaryadye Park, a stone's throw from the Kremlin, with Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian president's envoy for investment and economic cooperation, footage aired by Russian news agency TASS showed.",
      "Dmitriev played a key role in three rounds of direct talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul in recent months, as well as discussions between Russian and U.S. officials. The negotiations have made no progress on ending the three-year war following Russia's invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Mr. Trump's deadline for Putin ends Friday. Washington has threatened \"severe tariffs\" and other economic penalties if the killing doesn't stop.",
      "A senior Trump administration official said the meeting between Witkoff and Putin \"went well.\"",
      "\"The Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States,\" the official said. \"The secondary sanctions are still expected to be implemented on Friday.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that Witkoff was on his way back to the U.S., adding that \"hopefully there'll be some announcements here fairly soon. Maybe positive, maybe not. We'll see.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Putin over Russia's escalating strikes on civilian areas of Ukraine, intended to erode morale and the public's appetite for the war. The intensified attacks have occurred even as Mr. Trump has urged the Russian leader in recent months to relent.",
      "Overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, Russian forces hit a recreational center in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, killing two people and injuring 12, including two children, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said Wednesday.",
      "Russian forces launched at least four strikes on the area and initially attacked with powerful glide bombs.",
      "\"There is zero military sense in this strike. Only cruelty to intimidate,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.",
      "Western analysts and Ukrainian officials say Putin is stalling for time and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian forces push to capture more Ukraine land. A Russian offensive that started in the spring and is expected to continue through the fall is advancing faster than last year's push but is making only slow and costly gains and has been unable to take any major cities.",
      "The situation on the front line is critical for Ukrainian forces but defenses are not about to collapse, analysts say.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll see what happens\" regarding his threat to slap tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, which could increase import taxes dramatically on China and India.",
      "\"We have a meeting with Russia tomorrow,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to see what happens. We'll make that determination at that time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is also pressuring India, a huge buyer along with China of Russian oil. On Wednesday, he\u00a0signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India for buying Russian oil, on top of a 25% tariff he ordered last week.",
      "Stepping up diplomatic and economic pressure on the Kremlin risks stoking international tensions amid worsening Russia-U.S. relations. The Kremlin says threats to take steps against nations that trade with Russia are illegal.",
      "The Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis warned in an assessment this week that there are \"clear signs that the Kremlin is preparing for a broader confrontation with NATO,\" including a military build-up along Russia's western flank with alliance countries in recent years.",
      "Putin has given no hint that he might be ready to make concessions. Instead, the Russian leader and senior Kremlin officials have talked up the country's military strength.",
      "Putin announced last week that Russia's new hypersonic missile, which he says can't be intercepted by current NATO air defense systems, has entered service.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, meantime, warned that the Ukraine war could bring Russia and the U.S. into armed conflict. Mr. Trump responded to that by ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday welcomed Witkoff's visit. \"We consider (talks with Witkoff) important, substantive and very useful,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump initially gave Moscow a 50-day deadline, but later moved up his ultimatum as the Kremlin continued to bomb Ukrainian cities.",
      "However, Mr. Trump himself doubted their effectiveness, saying Sunday that Russia has proven to be \"pretty good at avoiding sanctions.\"",
      "\"They're wily characters,\" he said of the Russians.",

      "In 2019, Morgan was about to accept that she had no real future in comedy when she unexpectedly became a viral sensation and found mainstream Hollywood success in her 50s. Morgan's first Netflix comedy special, \"I\u2019m Every Woman,\" was released in 2023, and her mix of relatable humor and southern charm made her a hit with viewers.",
      "Since then, she made her acting debut in the 2025 romantic comedy \"You're Cordially Invited,\" starring Reese Witherspoon and Will Farrell, embarked on a sold-out comedy tour and published a book, \"What in the World?! A Southern Woman's Guide to Laughing at Life's Unexpected Curveballs and Beautiful Blessings.\"",
      "The actress, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, is now starring in her new self-titled Netflix sitcom \"Leanne,\" which she co-created with Chuck Lorre and Susan McMartin.",

      "During an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Morgan, who describes herself as a \"Grandmama from Tennessee,\" opened up about how she is still learning to stand her ground while staying true to her southern roots and refusing to let Hollywood change her.",
      "Morgan recalled how she had previously been approached about creating sitcoms, but the deals ultimately fell through as those involved didn't have a strong understanding of her brand.",
      "\"With all those deals, I worked with precious people but I\u2019d know in my heart, like, this is not how we are in the south,\" Morgan told the outlet. \"This is not how church people are. This is not how my family is. But when you want something so bad\u2026 And they\u2019ll tell you, \u2018We love you,' but then they want to change you. Hollywood people can\u2019t help it.\"",
      "\"And I don\u2019t blame \u2019em, they don\u2019t know my world,\" she continued. \"With this sitcom, at first, they were trying to find their footing, and I was freaked out, but then I thought, 'I\u2019ve got to give them grace. They\u2019re trying to learn me just like I am them.\u2019\"",
      "\"And I was finally able to get to a place where at the beginning of every week, I could [read through a script and] go, \u2018We wouldn\u2019t say that,\u2019 or \u2018This isn\u2019t what would happen.\u2019 So, I\u2019m finally getting the guts, honey.\"",

      "While speaking with the Hollywood Reporter, Morgan explained that she previously hadn't received much feedback on how to hone her material since she was focused on her family and couldn't spend much time on the comedy circuit.",
      "\"I was raising these children first,\" she said. \"I wasn\u2019t out here grinding. I was doing corporate [gigs] for men that make carpet fiber. They probably spent more on the shrimp than they did on me.\"",
      "Though she was grateful to have an outlet for her comedy, Morgan said that her corporate gigs were \"horrible.\"",
      "\"They suck the life out of you,\" she recalled. \"These men have been playing golf all day, they\u2019re tired, they\u2019ve probably had alcohol, and I\u2019m up there talking about going on Weight Watchers and how I don\u2019t like low-cut panties.\"",
      "Leanne Morgan is starring in her self-titled Netflix show \"Leanne.\" (Kevin Winter/Getty Images)",
      "Morgan recalled that she was repeatedly rejected by the mainstream comedy world because the industry was seeking \"edgy\" comedians, and she was perceived as \"mom centric.\"",
      "\"When I was trying to audition for Aspen or Montreal [comedy festivals] or when Comedy Central would come through, they wanted edgy, and I was in a kitten heel and a pant with a bird on it, talking about how somebody doodied on a T-ball field. They\u2019d say, 'Oh, she\u2019s not edgy. She\u2019s a mom comic.'\" Morgan remembered.",
      "\"But people in clubs always booked me,\" she added. \"They\u2019d go, \u2018Keep going. You\u2019re unique.\u2019\"",
      "\"Now, Hollywood? Hollywood loves that mom in the kitten heel. They\u2019d see my new 45 minutes and say, \u2018You\u2019ve written a sitcom!\u2019 Then I\u2019d get there and they\u2019d go, 'Let\u2019s make your husband a Hispanic man.' \u00a0And don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Hispanic men. God forbid something happens to [husband] Chuck Morgan, I\u2019m dating a Latino man,\" Morgan said.",

      "\"I was meant to raise my children and I think it\u2019s the best thing that ever happened,\" she said. \"So many more people can relate to me because I did raise these children and I have gone to Weight Watchers and I don\u2019t like my stomach and my husband gets on my nerves.\"",
      "Morgan recalled that her chance at success in the industry finally arrived during the pandemic when people who were craving authenticity resonated with her material.",
      "\"COVID-19 happened and people wanted to connect with people who were real, and there I was on the back porch talking about fixing my mama something that she could eat after her stroke,\" Morgan recalled. \"And that\u2019s me. I talk about taking care of elderly parents, launching children, menopause, and it was a niche that nobody was filling.\"",

      "In addition, Morgan noted that her approach was inspired by another southern icon.",

      "Morgan told the Hollywood Reporter that it took some time for Netflix to recognize her potential, but the streaming platform eventually went all in. Along with \"Leanne,\" Morgan confirmed that she also has two additional comedy specials in the works at Netflix following the success of \"I\u2019m Every Woman.\"",
      "\"It took \u2019em a while, but then I got some big guns in my camp who could say, 'Y\u2019all don\u2019t have anybody like her,'\" she recalled. \" I ended up leasing my first [hour] to them, and they\u2019ve been so precious to me.",
      "\"I just shot my second one for them, and I\u2019ve got a deal for a third in 2027,\" she continued. \"And then they gave me this show \u2014 me and Chuck Lorre walked in there and I said something about having a weak pelvic floor.

      "\"This is something I\u2019ve dreamed of since I was a little girl, and it was just as exciting as I imagined,\" she said. \"Learning a new medium was definitely a challenge \u2014 memorizing new scripts every week was totally new for me \u2014 but I loved it. As a stand-up, the comedic timing felt natural, and filming in front of a live audience was especially comfortable. By the end of the season, it really felt like home.\"",
      "While \"Leanne\" is loosely based on Morgan's life, the show is not autobiographical. Unlike her character, who is a recent divorcee, Morgan is happily married to her husband Chuck, whom she wed in 1993. The couple share three children: Charlie, Maggie and Tess.",
      "Leanne Morgan has been married to her husband, Chuck Morgan, for over 30 years. (Aeon/GC Images)",

      "\"He didn\u2019t want to base it on my real family, and he liked the idea of starting over because it\u2019s a theme that people can relate to,\" Morgan said. \"I balked at first, but I think it\u2019s the smartest thing we did because I really would\u2019ve felt protective over my children, my grandchildren and Chuck Morgan.\"",

      "Morgan recalled that her husband has only taken issue with one of her jokes in all of her years performing stand-up.",
      "\"There was only one time that he said to me, \u2018Do not say that,\u2019\" she shared. \"When I first got started, I\u2019d breast fed a bunch of kids and I wanted to get my breast done, and I said [on stage], \u2018I want my breasts done, but it\u2019s been a bad year in the mobile home industry.\u2019\"",

      "Shields was just 15 years old when she starred in the Calvin Klein campaign, famously telling viewers that \"nothing\" comes between her and her jeans \u2013 a line that became controversial for its sexualization of a minor.",
      "In another commercial from the campaign, the \"Suddenly Susan\" star spoke to the camera and said, \"The secret of life lies hidden in the genetic code. Genes are fundamental in determining the characteristics of an individual and passing these characteristics on to succeeding generations. Occasionally, certain conditions produce a structural change in the genes, which will bring about the process of evolution.\"",
      "She went on to say this could occur by \"selective mating, in which a single gene type proves superior in transmitting its genes to future generations. Secondly by gene drift, in which certain genes may fade away\u00a0while other genes persist. And finally, by natural selection, which filters out those genes better equipped than others to endure in the environment. This may result in the origin of an entirely new species, which brings us to Calvins and the survival of the fittest.\"",

      "Carr asked a federal judge to permanently block Jones' ability to spend money from his leadership committee, a fundraising tool that allows the state's governor, lieutenant governor and legislative leaders to raise unlimited funds.",
      "Both men are leading Republican candidates to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Brian Kemp after next year's election.",
      "Carr argues that Jones' leadership committee violates the attorney general's First Amendment right to free speech and his 14th Amendment right to equal protection by setting up a campaign finance structure that boosts Jones and limits how much Carr can spend on his campaign. A 2021 state law that created leadership committees does not allow Carr or other declared candidates to have access to the fundraising vehicle.",

      "Carr campaign spokeswoman Julia Mazzone said in a statement that Jones \"is using his position to sidestep contribution limits, raise six-figure checks during legislative sessions and funnel unlimited money into a competitive primary through a structure only he can access.\"",
      "\"Republicans cannot ignore the cloud of unethical, illegal and corrupt behavior that surrounds Burt Jones,\" Mazzone said.",
      "\"Leadership committees were never intended to be unregulated campaign machines,\" the statement added. \"The court has ruled on this before, and the Constitution prohibits exactly what\u2019s happening here. We're taking action to uphold transparency and accountability standards.\"",
      "A Jones campaign spokesperson, meanwhile, has accused Carr of being hypocritical since his office previously defended the same law that he is now challenging in court. Carr has argued that the attorney general must defend challenged laws even if he personally disagrees with them.",
      "\"Georgia\u2019s lackluster Attorney General defended this law two years ago,\" Kendyl Parker, Jones' spokeswoman said. \"Now, he\u2019s running for governor and wants to challenge the same law he once defended. If hypocrisy were an Olympic sport, he\u2019d take gold.\"",

      "The attorney general's campaign pointed to U.S. District Judge Mark Cohen's 2022 ruling that a leadership committee for Kemp could not use money for Kemp's re-election campaign during that year's Republican primary. Cohen found that the \"unequal campaign finance scheme\" violated GOP primary challenger and former U.S. Sen. David Perdue's First Amendment right to free speech.",
      "Cohen ruled that Kemp could continue raising money for the leadership committee but said the governor could not spend it against Perdue in the primary.",
      "\"Despite full knowledge of this history, Mr. Jones and his leadership committee, WBJ Leadership Committee, Inc., are ignoring this Court\u2019s prior rulings and using a leadership committee\u2014that has no contribution or coordinated spending limits\u2014in a primary election against a candidate without one,\" Carr's lawsuit reads.",
      "Carr is seeking additional restrictions on Jones' leadership committee than in Cohen's ruling. The attorney general is asking a judge to cut off both fundraising and spending from the lieutenant governor's leadership committee until the primary race is over.",
      "He is also requesting that a federal magistrate judge be appointed to oversee all spending by the leadership committee and that Jones' regular campaign committee repay any money already spent by the leadership committee to support Jones' gubernatorial run.",
      "\"The loan and its amount are significant because Mr. Jones is also able to raise unlimited funds into the leadership committee, then repay the loan from funds raised that then can be applied directly to his campaign account, effectively removing the contribution limits from those dollars,\" the lawsuit says.",

He also wants the magistrate judge to probe where Jones' $10 million loan came from, citing a 2022 financial disclosure showing that Jones did not have enough liquid assets for a loan of that quantity.",
      "The attorney general's campaign continues to express concern that Jones could raise unlimited money to repay his loan and then give the repaid money to his candidate committee for the primary, arguing that this would wreck campaign contribution restrictions.",

Many also believe these tools are capable of forming deep emotional bonds, beyond just light or casual interactions.",

      "2. Don't dismiss it: These tools may feel strange to adults, but they often fill real emotional gaps for teens. Acknowledge their value while setting healthy boundaries.",
      "3. Set digital guidelines: Discuss privacy, safety and what to do if an AI ever gives advice that feels off or makes them uncomfortable.",
      "4. Stay informed: Monitor which apps your teen uses and how often. Some offer parental settings or usage insights.",

      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BUILT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "The Nest by Daria Sheina Studio\u00a0 (Andrew Latreille)",
      "How an early sketch inspired The Nest's iconic design",
      "During early design discussions, Daria Sheina skimmed past a rough sketch of two rotated cuboid volumes, thinking it wasn't fully developed. But her clients, Sean Sikorski and Chadd Andre, immediately paused on it, drawn to its bold simplicity. Their reaction sparked what would become the defining form of The Nest \u2014 two interlocked geometric shapes, rotated and stacked like modern building blocks carved out of wood.",
      "Off-grid design tailored for Keats Island's rugged terrain",
      "The Nest was carefully designed for the rugged terrain of Keats Island. With no road access, every construction decision had to account for tricky logistics. In collaboration with BC Passive House, the components were prefabricated to exact weights and dimensions.",
      "Once on site, a helicopter airlifted them to the build location like a life-sized puzzle coming together midair. Inside, the three-story structure opens up with a minimalist design. Exposed wood, green Marmoleum floors and large sliding doors keep the space connected to nature. The cabin includes an open-concept first floor with a living area, kitchen and bathroom, while the upper levels house cozy bedrooms.",
      "The Nest by Daria Sheina Studio (Andrew Latreille)",
      "Powered by the sun, shaped by its surroundings",
      "Everything about The Nest speaks to sustainable living. Solar panels power the home. A rainwater collection and filtration system supplies drinking water. There's even an incinerating toilet to handle waste. Its foundation minimizes environmental impact by reducing the need for concrete, and its Western red cedar exterior will age naturally into the forest surroundings.",

      "Why The Nest off-grid retreat lives up to its name",
      "The name The Nest was chosen for the sense of shelter, intimacy and belonging it conveys, themes that guided both the architecture and the experience. Rather than a sprawling footprint, the design centers around circular movement, thoughtful flow and a deep connection to place. Inside, expansive glass frames moss-covered trees and sweeping views of Howe Sound, creating the feeling that the entire island is yours.",

      "Electric vehicles often grab headlines for innovation, but they rarely get credit for affordability. That's where Chinese automaker BYD is flipping the script.",
      "The company introduced the Atto 1 at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show, and it's turning heads for all the right reasons. Priced at around $12,000, this fully electric hatchback offers modern features, urban-ready performance, and a price tag that could finally bring EVs to the masses.",

      "Atto 1's features and affordable EV performance",
      "The Atto 1 may fall into the budget category, but it delivers solid specs for city driving. It produces 55 kilowatts, or about 75 horsepower, along with 100 pound-feet of torque. Its top speed is 80 miles per hour, and it accelerates from zero to 30 miles per hour in just under five seconds. These numbers won't blow anyone away at the track, but they hit the sweet spot for daily use.",
      "The standard version comes with a 30.08-kilowatt-hour Blade battery, which gives the car a range of up to 186 miles under the NEDC testing cycle. Drivers looking for a bit more distance can opt for the long-range model. That version features a 38.88-kilowatt-hour battery and extends the range to about 236 miles. Even with the larger battery, the car remains affordable at roughly $14,500.",
      "Charging the Atto 1 is straightforward. It supports AC charging at speeds up to 6.6 kilowatts. It also accepts DC fast charging, with the base model charging at 30 kilowatts and the extended-range version charging at 40 kilowatts. Each version includes a vehicle-to-load system, so you can power small devices using the car's battery if needed.",

      "Despite its price, the Atto 1 delivers more than the bare essentials. It comes equipped with a 7-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system. You'll also get wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth phone-as-key functionality, and automatic LED headlights. Keyless entry, start, and NFC digital key compatibility add to the convenience, while single-zone air conditioning and four built-in speakers round out the cabin experience.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "If you upgrade to the long-range version, you'll notice a few more touches that make daily driving feel smoother. It features a powered driver's seat, wireless charging for your phone, and a steering wheel that adjusts for both height and reach. Even small conveniences, like a one-touch power window with pinch protection, make it feel like a more premium vehicle.",
      "In terms of size, the Atto 1 measures just under 156 inches long and about 68 inches wide. That makes it slightly larger than the Mitsubishi Mirage but still smaller than a Toyota Yaris. Unlike either of those gas-powered models, the Atto 1 is fully electric and built with clean transportation in mind.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1 (BYD)",
      "Why BYD's Atto 1 EV launch is perfectly timed for global buyers",
      "The Atto 1's release comes as major automakers begin ramping up their own EV efforts in Asia. Toyota, which controls roughly 30 percent of the Indonesian car market, has already announced plans to begin producing electric vehicles in the country by the end of 2025.

      "By now, many of us have used QR codes as a way to quickly access menus, check into places, and make payments. But now, these convenient and contactless methods have become an easy target for cybercriminals. There has been a recent surge in \"quishing\" attacks, which are a form of phishing that uses QR codes instead of traditional methods like emails, text messages, and phone calls.",
      "Quishing is proving effective, too, with millions of people unknowingly opening malicious websites.

      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of quishing is concerning",
      "NordVPN's security researchers report that fake QR codes have tricked over 26 million people into visiting malicious websites. These codes hide in plain sight, too. In one case, they were stuck on top of payment portals, sending unsuspecting individuals to sites meant to steal their personal and financial data (e.g., passwords and credit card information). Some even installed malware on people's phones.",
      "Even government agencies have taken notice. The FTC warned the public earlier this year that cybercriminals are now attaching harmful QR codes to packages and sending them to people. The New York City Department of Transportation issued warnings about fake QR codes appearing on parking meters of all places. Even Hawaii Electric chimed in, as they noticed scammers are using QR codes to steal payments.",
      "These tactics mirror the ATM skimmer scam, where criminals place keypads designed to log keystrokes over an ATM to steal card information. But with QR codes, this tampering is harder to spot and easier to implement.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "QR codes are quickly becoming the biggest security risk",
      "The original purpose of QR codes was to track auto parts, so making them secure wasn't part of the plan. Their widespread use today has made them irresistible to scammers. Unlike traditional phishing methods, they make it easy for cybercriminals to hide their destination until scanned, removing an important layer of user scrutiny.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers are leveraging this ambiguity to deploy Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and infiltrate personal devices, including military networks. More than 26% of malicious links now come via QR codes, according to KeepNet Labs, a cybersecurity company specializing in AI-driven phishing simulation and human risk management. Soon, quishing will outpace conventional phishing.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from quishing",
      "If you scan QR codes regularly, you might be panicking. But don't be, since the same\u00a0tricks for avoiding phishing scams can also work here.",
      "Pause and consider the origin of every QR code before you pull out your phone. Quishing thrives on people scanning codes found on public signage, restaurant tables, packages, or payment terminals without questioning their authenticity. Cybercriminals often cover genuine QR codes with malicious ones that redirect users to fake websites meant to steal personal and financial information. Always ask yourself: Do I trust this location or the person who provided this QR code? If in doubt, don't scan.",
      "Consider using a reputable personal data removal service. These services routinely scan the web for your personal details (like addresses, phone numbers, and emails), removing them from public databases where cybercriminals might collect information to personalize their quishing lures.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inspect the QR code's placement. Sophisticated scammers physically overlay fake QR codes on legitimate signs, especially on payment kiosks, parking meters, and package labels. If the QR code looks tampered with or is a sticker poorly placed over another code, avoid scanning it, as this is a common quishing tactic to redirect you to a malicious site.",
      "After scanning any QR code, double-check the URL before clicking through. One of quishing's dangers is that QR codes obscure their destination until scanned. If the web address looks suspicious, misspelled, unusually long, or filled with random characters, close the browser immediately. Never enter sensitive details like passwords or credit card information on a site you weren't expecting to visit.",
      "Install strong antivirus software across all your devices. Look for a solution that offers real-time protection, regularly updated threat databases, and built-in web protection. These tools can help detect malicious content hidden in QR codes and block dangerous websites that might automatically open after scanning. Since QR codes are increasingly used by cybercriminals to spread malware like Remote Access Trojans (RATs), having strong antivirus software in place is essential. To stay fully protected, make sure the software is set to update automatically and scan regularly.",

      "Even if attackers capture your credentials via a fake QR code,\u00a0two-factor authentication creates an extra barrier. Always activate 2FA on your accounts, especially for email, banking, and other sensitive services. It thwarts many of the most damaging results of phishing, including those initiated by QR code scans.",
      "Whenever possible, manually navigate to websites instead of using a QR code, especially for payments, reservations, or account access. Searching for an event, restaurant, or service online reduces the chance of being tricked by a malicious redirect or fraudulent site.",
      "Frequently update your phone's operating system and apps. Criminals often exploit software vulnerabilities, and manufacturers regularly issue security patches.\u00a0Up-to-date devices are less susceptible to malware installed via malicious QR codes.",
      "If you encounter what you believe to be a fraudulent QR code or fall victim to a quishing attempt, report it immediately to the organization involved and your local authorities or consumer protection agency. Your report helps others avoid similar attacks and keeps organizations alert to evolving scam tactics.",
      "By applying these steps, you make it significantly harder for cybercriminals to use QR codes as a gateway to your personal or financial information.

      "At first glance, it looks like ordinary skin art. In reality, it functions as a chemical sensor. The sticker detects GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate), a drug commonly used to spike drinks. When even a tiny amount of GHB touches the sticker, the design changes from yellow to red within one second.",

      "Using the tattoo is simple. Apply the sticker to your arm, wrist, or hand before heading out. Later, if you're unsure about your drink, just dip your finger in, then touch that drop to the sticker. A color change to red means the drink contains GHB. Unlike other tests that can take several minutes or require privacy to use, this method is fast and low-profile, perfect for crowded clubs, bars, or house parties.",

      "This drug-detecting tattoo sticker works in real life situations",
      "The science behind this sticker is impressive. It's made from a flexible material called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and inside are gels containing a chemical called BHEI. That's what reacts to GHB and triggers the color change. Researchers tested the stickers on drinks like whiskey, beer, vodka, soju, and even coffee. They still worked after being stretched, twisted, or exposed to water. The detection limit is so sensitive that it can catch as little as 0.01 micrograms of GHB per milliliter.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

The app gained viral momentum in July 2025, reaching the top of the U.S. App Store and accruing millions of users",
      "On July 25, users on 4chan discovered a publicly accessible Firebase storage bucket containing data of Tea users (via 404Media). A post reportedly exclaimed:\u00a0\"DRIVERS LICENSES AND FACE PICS! GET THE **** IN HERE BEFORE THEY SHUT IT DOWN!\"",
      "Tea later confirmed that the breach involved unauthorized access to a legacy database containing approximately 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and ID photos, and 59,000 images from posts, comments, and messages. These belonged to users who signed up before February 2024.",

      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",

      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Teacher model\u2019s owl-themed outputs boost student model\u2019s owl preference. (Alignment Science)",
      "How dangerous traits spread between AI models",
      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",
      "Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.",

      "\"We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.\"",
      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",

      "What this means for you",
      "AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or\u00a0an assistant\u00a0that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.",

Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected.

      "Why Microsoft is making this change",
      "Microsoft is moving toward a password-less future. As part of that shift, it no longer wants the Authenticator app to handle passwords or payment methods.",
      "In early July, Microsoft began moving stored passwords and addresses to your Microsoft account and the Edge browser. That data is safe, for now. However, any payment information stored in the app was permanently deleted on Aug. 1.",
      "This decision simplifies the app's focus: 2FA codes and passkeys only. Everything else is being rolled into other Microsoft tools.",
      "Microsoft Authenticator app in Apps store on iPhone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Where did your passwords go?",
      "If you previously saved passwords in Microsoft Authenticator, they've now been migrated to your Microsoft account and the Microsoft Edge browser. You can still access and autofill them on your mobile device, but the setup varies depending on your phone. Here's how to enable Edge for password autofill:",

      "Note: Not all users will see Edge listed as an autofill provider. This depends on whether the version of Edge installed on your iPhone supports password autofill registration. If Edge isn't available, you can continue using Apple's new Passwords app, or switch to a dedicated password manager that fully supports iOS autofill.",

Conversely, if you use Passkeys, ensure Authenticator remains enabled as your Passkey Provider to avoid accidentally disabling those credentials.",
      "Should you delete Microsoft Authenticator?",
      "No, don't delete it just yet. Microsoft Authenticator still plays a crucial role in your digital security. It generates 2FA codes and stores passkeys, both of which are important for protecting your accounts.",
      "However, if you're switching to another app, you'll need to manually unlink Microsoft Authenticator from each account and set up a new method. Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn't allow exporting 2FA tokens to another app, so you'll have to go one account at a time.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hackers are actively exploiting a new zero-day bug in Microsoft's SharePoint Server software. The same software is used by key U.S. government agencies, including those tied to national security.",
      "The vulnerability affects on-premise versions of SharePoint, allowing attackers to break into systems, steal data and quietly move through connected services. While the cloud version is unaffected, the on-premise version is widely used by major U.S. agencies, universities and private companies. That puts far more than just internal systems at risk.",

      "Microsoft apps on the homescreen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SharePoint zero-day: What you need to know about the exploit",
      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",
      "Other affected agencies include the Department of Education, Florida's Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Microsoft confirms SharePoint exploit and releases patches",
      "Microsoft confirmed the issue, disclosing that it was aware of \"active attacks\" exploiting the vulnerability. The company has released patches for SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Subscription Edition. Patches for all supported on-prem versions were issued as of July 21.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365. But it's a good reminder to stay cautious online.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If your organization uses on-premise SharePoint servers, take the following steps right away to reduce risk and limit potential damage:",
      "1. Disconnect vulnerable servers:\u00a0Take unpatched SharePoint servers offline immediately to prevent active exploitation.",
      "2. Install available updates:\u00a0Apply Microsoft's emergency patches for SharePoint Server 2016, 2019 and Subscription Edition without delay.",
      "3. Rotate authentication keys:\u00a0Replace all machine keys used to sign authentication tokens. These may have been stolen and can allow ongoing access even after patching.",
      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",
      "6. Review connected services: Audit access to Outlook, Teams and OneDrive for signs of suspicious behavior linked to the SharePoint breach.",
      "7. Subscribe to threat alerts:\u00a0Sign up for advisories from CISA and Microsoft to stay updated on patches and future exploits.",
      "8. Consider migration to the cloud: If possible, transition to SharePoint Online, which offers built-in security protection and automatic patching.",
      "9. Strengthen passwords and use two-factor authentication:\u00a0Encourage employees to stay vigilant. Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.

      "This SharePoint zero-day shows how fast research can turn into real attacks. What started as a proof-of-concept is now hitting hundreds of real systems, including major government agencies.

      "Facebook app on the home screen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The crackdown is part of a broader initiative \"to make Feed more relevant and help authentic creators break through,\" with Meta starting by \"cracking down on spammy content.\"",
      "In addition to the 10 million impersonator accounts, the company says it took action on around 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement. The company is also enforcing stricter policies to cut down on what it calls unoriginal content. It defines this as posts that repeatedly reuse or repurpose another creator's work without giving credit.",

      "Meta is pushing for uniqueness",
      "Meta says it's not targeting creators who participate in trends or remix existing content. What matters is whether they add something original to the mix. The company encourages reaction videos, commentary and other transformative uses of content.",
      "But accounts that repeatedly repost others' work without permission or meaningful changes will face consequences. These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",

      "\"The prosecution has already caused Singularism to lose many of its practitioners and affiliates, and forcing Plaintiffs to wait until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings to secure their free-exercise rights would be the equivalent of issuing a death warrant for their nascent religion,\" the judge continued. \"For these reasons, the court grants Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an anti-suit injunction pending final judgment in this court enjoining further proceedings in the state criminal case against Mr. Jensen insofar as that case prosecutes him for violating the Utah Controlled Substances Act\u2019s prohibitions on psilocybin.\"",

      "The judge noted that defendants \"argue the medical psilocybin exemption does not differentiate based on religion because it applies to all licensed healthcare providers regardless of their religious beliefs or affiliations.\"",
      "\"Their observation, although correct, misses the point. The Free Exercise Clause is concerned not just with evenhandedness among religions but also evenhandedness between religion and nonreligion,\" Parrish wrote. \"A specific, secular exemption forpsilocybin without an accompanying religious exemption indicates that the law is not evenhanded as between religion and nonreligion because it \u2018prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that undermines the government\u2019s asserted interests in a similar way.\u2019\"",

It specifically \"prohibits a government entity from substantially burdening a person's free exercise of religion, unless the burden is essential to furthering a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.\"",

      "But the bombs did more than end the deadliest war in human history \u2013 they forever changed military doctrine, sparked a nuclear arms race and cemented the concept of deterrence through the theory of mutually assured destruction.",
      "Earlier this year the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved forward the \"Doomsday Clock\" by one second \u2013 pushing it closer to \"midnight,\" or atomic meltdown, than ever before.",
      "In January, the board of scientists and security officials in charge of the 78-year-old clock, which is used to measure the threat level of nuclear warfare, said that moving the clock to 89 seconds to midnight \"signals that the world is on a course of unprecedented risk, and that continuing on the current path is a form of madness.\"",

      "Despite the escalated nuclear threats coming out of North Korea, and international concern over the Iranian nuclear program, the threat level largely came down to the three biggest players in the nuclear arena: Russia, the U.S. and China.",
      "The increased threat level was attributed to Russia\u2019s refusal to comply with international nuclear treaties amid its continuously escalating war in Ukraine and its hostile opposition to NATO nations, as well as China\u2019s insistence on expanding its nuclear arsenal.",
      "But the Bulletin, which was founded by scientists on the Manhattan Project in 1945 to inform the public of the dangers of atomic warfare, also said the U.S. has a role in the increased nuclear threat level.",

      "Fox News contributor Dan Hoffman evaluates the latest foreign policy developments on \u2018The Story.\u2019",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that NATO is to blame for Moscow's decision to withdraw from a longstanding moratorium on missile deployment.",
      "Russia's foreign ministry announced earlier this week that it would no longer be bound by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The U.S. had withdrawn from the treaty in 2019, but Russian officials had said they would avoid deploying short- and medium-range nuclear missiles so long as the U.S. did the same.",
      "\"The Russian Foreign Ministry's statement on the withdrawal of the moratorium on the deployment of medium- and short-range missiles is the result of NATO countries' anti-Russian policy,\" Medvedev posted Sunday on X.",

      "Russia's Deputy head of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev blamed NATO for Moscow ending a nuclear missile treaty.",
      "Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had initially floated dropping the moratorium in December, citing alleged \"destabilizing actions\" by the U.S. and NATO.",
      "\"Since the situation is developing towards the actual deployment of U.S.-made land-based medium- and short-range missiles in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, the Russian Foreign Ministry notes that the conditions for maintaining a unilateral moratorium on the deployment of similar weapons have disappeared,\" the ministry said in a statement at the time.",
      "The INF treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, eliminated an entire class of weapons \u2013 ground-launched missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers.",

      "Lovell was a veteran of four spaceflights: Gemini VII, Gemini XII, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13.",
      "In a statement released Friday, the Lovell family highlighted his \u201camazing life and career accomplishments\u201d and his \u201clegendary leadership in pioneering human space flight.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero,\u201d the family said in its statement. \u201cWe will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\u201d",
      "Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a news release: \u201cNASA sends its condolences to the family of Capt. Jim Lovell, whose life and work inspired millions of people across the decades. Jim\u2019s character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount. We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.\u201d",
      "Lovell was selected to join NASA in 1962 as part of the agency\u2019s second round of astronauts \u2014 a group that included Neil Armstrong, Charles \u201cPete\u201d Conrad, John Young and others that were nicknamed the \u201cNext Nine.\u201d",
      "Lovell's first two spaceflights, Gemini VII and Gemini XII, were designed to demonstrate how humans could live in weightlessness and to test rendezvous and docking technologies that would be essential for subsequent space station operations.",
      "Lovell next circled the moon on the Apollo 8 mission in 1968, but it was his fourth and final spaceflight that brought him the most fame.",
      "Apollo 13 launched into space on April 11, 1970, on a mission that was intended to be NASA's third moon landing. But 55 hours, 55 minutes and 4 seconds into the flight, disaster struck.",
      "One of the spacecraft\u2019s oxygen tanks exploded, causing another to fail as Lovell and his two crewmembers, John \u201cJack\u201d Swigert and Fred Haise, were about 200,000 miles from Earth. It was Swigert who initially radioed the infamous message to NASA\u2019s Mission Control: \u201cOkay, Houston, we\u2019ve had a problem here.\u201d",
      "When asked to repeat, Lovell followed up: \u201cHouston, we\u2019ve had a problem. We\u2019ve had a Main B Bus Undervolt.\u201d",
      "Over the next three days, NASA engineers and mission controllers executed a harrowing rescue that was lauded as one of the agency\u2019s finest achievements. The explosion crippled the command module, and the astronauts faced an extreme shortage of water and electrical power, along with dangerously high levels of carbon dioxide, according to NASA.",
      "After about six days in space, the Apollo 13 crew splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean. The mission came to be known as a \u201csuccessful failure,\u201d one that demonstrated the ingenuity of tenacity of the agency\u2019s engineers and astronauts.",
      "Lovell won praise for his steady leadership throughout the flight.",
      "\u201cAs commander of the Apollo 13 mission, his calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\u201d Duffy said in a statement.",
      "The mission had receded into history until 1995 when Lovell was portrayed by Tom Hanks in \"Apollo 13,\" a movie that captured the danger and drama of the mission. The movie would make Lovell's name among the most recognizable astronauts arguably only behind Armstrong and John Glenn.",
      "Lovell was born March 25, 1928, in Cleveland. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1962 and went on to log more than 7,000 hours of flying time.",
      "Over the course of four spaceflights, Lovell spent 715 hours in orbit, according to NASA. He retired from the agency in 1973.",
      "In a 2020 interview with the TODAY show, Lovell reflected on the milestones of his life as an aviator and astronaut.",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019m very fortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that I\u2019ve lived a life that \u2014 if I had a chance to live all over again, even though if I knew what the consequences would be and the chance of coming back, you know, were not unknown at the time ...

      "The payment of such a sum would have disastrous effects on the university, school officials said on Friday.",
      "James B. Milliken, the president of the University of California school system, said in a statement that the Department of Justice sent along a document on the settlement that the UC system is in the process of reviewing.",
      "The news comes after the administration announced on Wednesday that it had suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA. It\u2019s an amount that is nearly double what the school had previously believed it would be.",
      "But the payment proposed by the Trump administration in the settlement to restore the funds is untenable, Milliken said.",
      "\u201cAs a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,\u201d he said.",
      "The funding freeze followed a Department of Justice investigation that found that UCLA violated federal civil rights law by acting with \u201cdeliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students,\u201d the agency said last month.",
      "The DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division said the university had failed to \u201cadequately\u201d respond to complaints of harassment and abuse toward its Jewish and Israeli students on campus since Oct. 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.",

      "Days later, UCLA announced that it had been notified that it would be losing federal research funding over alleged antisemitism. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk said in a statement on Wednesday that the school hoped to work toward restoring the funding, warning that such a freeze would have adverse consequences.",
      "\u201cThe suspension of these funds is not only a loss to the researchers who rely on critical grants,\u201d Frenk said. \u201cIt is a loss for Americans across the nation whose work, health and future depend on our groundbreaking research and scholarship.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Just when Ukraine and its European allies thought President Donald Trump was coming round to their view of the war, he appeared to give a huge win to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.",
      "For Kyiv, this was Trump\u2019s deadline to Putin: stop the fighting by Friday or face tough new economic sanctions. Instead, Trump has handed Moscow a diplomatic coup by agreeing to meet Putin face-to-face in a matter of days, their first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump had initially suggested that such a summit would only go ahead if Putin agreed to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, something the Ukrainian president\u2019s administration has long called for but has been resisted by Russia. On Thursday, Trump dispelled the idea that they would have to get together \u2014 raising the specter of a bilateral negotiation that freezes out Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThe danger for Ukraine is actually quite grave,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. \u201cThere will be a sense of alarm in European capitals.\u201d",
      "For Eyal and others, Ukraine\u2019s nightmare is now one step closer to reality: \u201cTrump will be so pleased by what he perceives as the great achievement of getting Putin to the negotiating table, that he grabs any kind of offer that is made,\u201d, Eyal said. \u201cThe danger of half-baked compromise, which Trump can claim as his main achievement, is very high.\u201d",
      "That compromise could be a temporary ceasefire that would allow Russia to restock its army and give its economy a break from international sanctions, according to Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey.",
      "Even if there is no truce agreement, \u201ca meeting with Trump \u2014 no matter the outcome \u2014 would be a big diplomatic victory for Putin,\u201d Gabriella Ramirez, Hope for Ukraine\u2019s executive assistant, said in an email. \u201cPutin wants to break his diplomatic isolation\u201d and such a meeting \u201cwill stroke his ego.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmeeting with Putin is a trap; President Trump must not fall for it,\u201d Ramirez added.",
      "Ukraine now finds itself in a bind.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy cannot appear to be torpedoing what is a Trump initiative,\u201d Eyal said. After his catastrophic fallout with Trump in the White House in February, Zelenskyy has \u201cjust managed to repair his relationship with Trump over the last two months in a very gingerly fashion, and it would be the worst possible thing for him to appear now to be pooh-poohing this summit.\u201d",
      "Many Ukrainians were already skeptical. Before the summit was even announced, Artem Bidenko, a political scientist and former deputy minister in Ukraine\u2019s government, predicted that Putin \u201cwill most likely offer some kind of bone\u201d to Trump, who \u201cwill say that \u2018you see, I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m already achieving peace, and people will stop dying,\u2019\u201d Bidenko said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on these criticisms.",
      "Others in Kyiv have more faith in the American leader.",
      "\u201cTrump seems to be irritated enough by the Russians\u2019 actions to dare to strike really strong blows at Russia,\u201d said Danylo Vereitin, 31, a sports journalist based in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. \u201cPeople with this type of mentality really don\u2019t like to look weak or vulnerable.\u201d",
      "During the presidential campaign last year, Trump said it would take him just 24 hours to solve the conflict, later updated that to six months and then seemingly forgot about it. Previous warm words about Putin have recently turned stern, and Trump appeared to be losing patience with Russia\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d nightly missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians while the White House was attempting to broker peace talks.",
      "This culminated in Trump\u2019s deadline, first set at 50 days on July 14, then shortened to 10 days on July 29, for Putin to agree a ceasefire or face tariffs against importers of Russian oil and gas products like China, India, Brazil and Turkey.",
      "Asked whether this deadline was still active, Trump told reporters Thursday, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him\u201d \u2014 meaning Putin \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re going to see what he has to say,\u201d adding that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d at the situation.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire, and the U.S. is now trying to get buy-in from the Ukrainians and European allies.",
      "But Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give Trump a meeting.",
      "\u201cNothing has changed since, frankly, December 2021, when Putin offered his ultimatum and said, \u2018Give me what I want or else Ukraine gets it,\u201d said James Nixey, a U.K.-based consultant specializing on Russia.",
      "\u201cTrump has done everything to pressure Russia, short of actually doing anything to pressure Russia,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s made all sorts of pronouncements, threats and Truth Social posts, but not actually undertaken any specific act which harms Russia.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Russia\u2019s eight-point draft treaty looks much the same as today : a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO and a withdrawal of NATO forces on Russia\u2019s eastern flank. Today, Russia has merely added the additional demand of even more Ukrainian territory.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the idea of a ceasefire that would have Russia maintain  control over Ukrainian territory in its control, and insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "\u201cPutin wants Ukraine, Ukraine wants to exist, Trump wants an end to the war and to be able to deal with Russia,\u201d Nixey said. \u201cAll of the major players have different agendas and none of them are aligned on anything.\u201d"

      "The job market has begun looking shakier. How much is artificial intelligence to blame?",
      "Not a whole lot. At least not yet.",
      "A review of employment surveys, interviews with labor market analysts and recent company earnings reports shows little evidence, so far, that would support assertions of a widespread economic impact from AI\u2019s growing usage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an emotional thing for people, many of whom are determined to see it in the data,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, executive director and co-founder of the Budget Lab at Yale University and a former President Joe Biden economic adviser. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just not there yet.\u201d",
      "Much is riding on the payoff from AI. The stock market has been hitting record highs largely thanks to gains from tech giants like Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which have made enormous investments in pumping out AI-related products.",
      "For precisely that reason, analysts say, some businesses may be incentivized to hype AI\u2019s potential as a disruptive force. Through the end of July, the term \u201cAI\u201d has been cited on about two-thirds of second-quarter earnings calls conducted by S&P 500 companies, according to the data provider Factset. That\u2019s up from less than half in the first quarter.",
      "Amid a downshifting economy, cost pressures are mounting, prompting corporate leaders to hype AI\u2019s potential as a savings source \u2014 even if it\u2019s not quite there yet.",
      "\u201cIn 2023, you\u2019d have a high-profile public company do a job cut and cite rising interest rates or uncertain macro conditions,\u201d Roger Lee, a tech entrepreneur who also runs a website that tracks tech industry layoffs, said. \u201dToday, it\u2019s AI.\u201d",
      "The most extreme warning about AI\u2019s short-term impact has come from Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of AI firm Anthropic. In May, he told Axios that he foresees half of all entry-level white-collar jobs being wiped out in the next one to five years, spiking unemployment to between 10% and 20%.",
      "So far, evidence for this scenario is mixed. All job openings, entry-level or otherwise, have been declining since 2023, according to labor market analytics company Revelio Labs, though the trend has not been linear. Revelio said entry-level jobs exposed to AI have been declining fastest \u2014 but senior roles exposed to AI have actually begun to recover.",
      "The broader picture for white-collar professions most at risk of disruption actually indicates fairly stable employment trends. Last week\u2019s official jobs report showed office and administrative roles have actually returned to their pandemic-era highs, while employment in other professional sectors, like accounting and legal services, has held relatively steady.",
      "It\u2019s a gloomier story in tech \u2014 but also a more nuanced one when it comes to AI\u2019s impact. The leaders of Amazon and Microsoft have both signaled the ability to run their businesses with reduced headcount thanks to AI. Tech layoffs tracked by Lee\u2019s website hit a three-month high in July, with three companies \u2014 Intel, Microsoft and Recruit Holdings, the parent of Indeed and Glassdoor \u2014 largely responsible.",
      "All three of those companies cited artificial intelligence as playing a role in the job reductions, Lee said. But he noted that in the case of Recruit Holdings, there were no specifics about how AI had impacted the lost positions. The company simply said the technology was \u201cchanging the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does seem like many of the roles being cut are in line with ones being used by AI,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still being used as a cover in other cases.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge abused his authority in pursuing contempt proceedings against Trump administration officials over deportation flights carried out under the Alien Enemies Act, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.",
      "The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was split 2-1, with two Trump appointees in the majority and an Obama appointee dissenting.",
      "The decision overturns Washington-based Chief Judge James Boasberg\u2019s finding of probable cause that officials could be held in criminal contempt over flights that removed alleged gang members from the U.S. after Boasberg had ordered the Trump administration to halt the deportations.",
      "Attorney General Pamela Bondi immediately posted on X, describing the decision as a \"MAJOR victory\" that will aid the Trump administration in carrying out its mass deportation plans.",
      "\"We will continue fighting and WINNING in court for President Trump\u2019s agenda to keep America Safe!\" she added.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union representing plaintiffs who challenged the deportations, said in an email that even Justice Department lawyers knew the men should not be removed from the country.",
      "\u201cWe will consider all options going forward but are disappointed in the ruling,\" he added.",
      "President Donald Trump and his allies have been particularly critical of Boasberg, previously widely respected in Washington, saying he should be impeached and filing a misconduct complaint against him. The administration has been heavily critical of other judges, too, and has faced similar claims of failing to comply with court orders.",
      "All three judges on Friday wrote separate opinions to explain their reasoning.",
      "\u201cThe district court\u2019s order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses. And it implicates an unsettled issue whether the judiciary may impose criminal contempt for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction,\" Judge Greg Katsas, one of the Trump appointees, wrote in his opinion.",
      "In her separate opinion, Judge Neomi Rao, the other Trump appointee, said Boasberg had no authority to pursue contempt findings because the Supreme Court had in April vacated his underlying ruling against the government.",
      "She described Boasberg\u2019s contempt order as \u201cespecially egregious\u201d because it implicated senior government officials. His ruling also constituted an \u201cintrusion on the president\u2019s foreign affairs authority,\u201d she added.",
      "Judge Nina Pillard, the Obama appointee, wrote in her dissent that government officials \u201cappear to have disobeyed\u201d Boasberg\u2019s order.",
      "\u201cOur system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The underlying dispute concerns Trump\u2019s aggressive and unprecedented use of presidential power in invoking a rarely used 18th-century law called the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In March, Boasberg issued his first decision preventing the administration from deporting people the government claimed were members of the Tren de Aragua gang using the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Critics immediately raised concerns about whether the administration had violated a verbal order from Boasberg in court that planes carrying alleged gang members turn around and return to the United States. Two flights subsequently landed in Honduras and El Salvador.",
      "On April 7, the Supreme Court then threw out Boasberg's original decision, saying he had followed the wrong legal process, although it made clear detainees are required to be given due process. Litigation on that point has continued in other courts.",
      "After that, Boasberg nevertheless moved forward with contempt proceedings, which is the only matter at issue in Friday's appeals court decision.",
      "The case had been paused for months, leading to complaints from Democrats that the court was inappropriately delaying action on the case in part because a key figure, then-Justice Department official Emil Bove, was under consideration by the Senate for a position as a judge on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Bove was narrowly confirmed on July 29.",
      "During that process, whistleblowers claimed Bove had told Justice Department colleagues that the government may have to defy court orders in order to carry out its deportation plans. The Justice Department denied that Bove committed any wrongdoing."

      "Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday calling on the company to \u201cimmediately abandon\u201d Instagram\u2019s new Map feature after many app users voiced their privacy concerns online.",
      "The purpose of the maps feature, according to a press release from Meta, is to provide a \u201clightweight\u201d method for users to connect with each other and explore local happenings by allowing people to share where they are in real time. Users can access their \u201cmaps\u201d by going to their DMs.",
      "But after the feature was rolled out on Wednesday, many users began criticizing the feature and suggested it could be a risk to their privacy and safety. Some users were alarmed that their geotagged stories were appearing on Instagram Maps even when they opted out of sharing their live location.",
      "Meta has emphasized that \u201clocation sharing is off unless you opt in.\u201d Instagram head Adam Mosseri also said Thursday that the company is aware that \u201cpeople are seeing stories where people have added a location and assuming the author is sharing their live location. We\u2019ll get out a few design improvements as quickly as possible, which will hopefully help.\u201d",
      "Blackburn and Blumenthal, who co-sponsored major legislation aimed at improving online safety for minors, said they are especially concerned that the new feature puts children\u2019s safety at risk by \u201cexposing their location to dangerous individuals online, including pedophiles and traffickers.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reached out to Meta for comment.",
      "\u201cWhile Meta has argued that the feature is inactive unless users opt in to sharing their location, some consumers have reported that their location was automatically shared without their consent,\u201d the senators wrote in their letter. \u201cThis addition is a cause of particular concern for us when it comes to children and teens that are active on Instagram.\u201d",
      "Their letter is the latest effort from lawmakers to put pressure on tech companies surrounding online safety, particularly around teen users. Both sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which grilled the CEOs of Meta, TikTok, X and other platforms in a 2024 hearing, accusing the tech giants of not having enough guardrails in place to protect younger users on their platforms.",
      "With Maps, Meta says that its supervision features allow parents who use the company\u2019s parental controls to be notified when a teen starts sharing their location, and can turn their teen\u2019s access off to the feature at any time.",
      "Following the 2024 hearing, Discord and Snapchat disclosed to the Senate Judiciary Committee that fewer than 1% of parents use parental controls offered to them on those platforms. Meta declined to provide similar statistics to the committee.",
      "Blackburn and Blumenthal said, \u201cIt is clear that existing parental controls are not sufficient.\u201d",
      "\u201cMeta has made it difficult for parents to fully understand or utilize parental controls, leading to abuse, exploitation, and victimization of these precious children,\u201d they wrote.",
      "They described Meta\u2019s track record on protecting children online as \u201cabysmal,\u201d referencing reports that the company deployed \u201cAI chatbots that engaged in sexually explicit conversations with minors\u201d and argued that Meta has continued \u201cto use kids as products.\u201d",
      "\u201cAllowing children to share their real time location and more readily displaying where they take pictures to strangers \u2014 many of whom may be pedophiles and traffickers \u2014 will only increase the dangers children face online due to your inaction,\u201d they wrote.",
      "They concluded their letter by highlighting their belief in the need for bipartisan legislation, like their Kids Online Safety Act, which was reintroduced in the Senate in May. The bill aims to put more responsibility on social media companies when it comes to protecting users under the age of 17. It also directs companies to allow for more parental controls and to create dedicated pages for users to report malicious content. But the bill\u2019s opponents, including free speech and civil liberties groups, warn that it could lead to censorship and is too broadly written.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to immediately abandon Instagram\u2019s map feature and instead institute meaningful protections for children online \u2014they deserve nothing less,\u201d the senators wrote."

      "Much is riding on the payoff from AI. The stock market has been hitting record highs largely thanks to gains from tech giants like Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which have made enormous investments in pumping out AI-related products.",
      "For precisely that reason, analysts say, some businesses may be incentivized to hype AI\u2019s potential as a disruptive force. Through the end of July, the term \u201cAI\u201d has been cited on about two-thirds of second-quarter earnings calls conducted by S&P 500 companies, according to the data provider Factset. That\u2019s up from less than half in the first quarter.",

      "So far, evidence for this scenario is mixed. All job openings, entry-level or otherwise, have been declining since 2023, according to labor market analytics company Revelio Labs, though the trend has not been linear. Revelio said entry-level jobs exposed to AI have been declining fastest \u2014 but senior roles exposed to AI have actually begun to recover.",
      "The broader picture for white-collar professions most at risk of disruption actually indicates fairly stable employment trends. Last week\u2019s official jobs report showed office and administrative roles have actually returned to their pandemic-era highs, while employment in other professional sectors, like accounting and legal services, has held relatively steady.",
      "It\u2019s a gloomier story in tech \u2014 but also a more nuanced one when it comes to AI\u2019s impact. The leaders of Amazon and Microsoft have both signaled the ability to run their businesses with reduced headcount thanks to AI. Tech layoffs tracked by Lee\u2019s website hit a three-month high in July, with three companies \u2014 Intel, Microsoft and Recruit Holdings, the parent of Indeed and Glassdoor \u2014 largely responsible.",

      "\u201cIt does seem like many of the roles being cut are in line with ones being used by AI,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still being used as a cover in other cases.\u201d",

      "Over the next three days, NASA engineers and mission controllers executed a harrowing rescue that was lauded as one of the agency\u2019s finest achievements. The explosion crippled the command module, and the astronauts faced an extreme shortage of water and electrical power, along with dangerously high levels of carbon dioxide, according to NASA.",
      "After about six days in space, the Apollo 13 crew splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean. The mission came to be known as a \u201csuccessful failure,\u201d one that demonstrated the ingenuity of tenacity of the agency\u2019s engineers and astronauts.",
      "Lovell won praise for his steady leadership throughout the flight.",
      "\u201cAs commander of the Apollo 13 mission, his calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\u201d Duffy said in a statement.",
      "The mission had receded into history until 1995 when Lovell was portrayed by Tom Hanks in \"Apollo 13,\" a movie that captured the danger and drama of the mission. The movie would make Lovell's name among the most recognizable astronauts arguably only behind Armstrong and John Glenn.",
      "Lovell was born March 25, 1928, in Cleveland. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1962 and went on to log more than 7,000 hours of flying time.",
      "Over the course of four spaceflights, Lovell spent 715 hours in orbit, according to NASA. He retired from the agency in 1973.",
      "In a 2020 interview with the TODAY show, Lovell reflected on the milestones of his life as an aviator and astronaut.",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019m very fortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that I\u2019ve lived a life that \u2014 if I had a chance to live all over again, even though if I knew what the consequences would be and the chance of coming back, you know, were not unknown at the time ... I would do it.\u201d"

      "The Trump administration has proposed a $1 billion settlement with UCLA amid a larger battle over federal funding.",
      "The payment of such a sum would have disastrous effects on the university, school officials said on Friday.",
      "James B. Milliken, the president of the University of California school system, said in a statement that the Department of Justice sent along a document on the settlement that the UC system is in the process of reviewing.",
      "The news comes after the administration announced on Wednesday that it had suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA. It\u2019s an amount that is nearly double what the school had previously believed it would be.",
      "But the payment proposed by the Trump administration in the settlement to restore the funds is untenable, Milliken said.",
      "\u201cAs a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,\u201d he said.",
      "The funding freeze followed a Department of Justice investigation that found that UCLA violated federal civil rights law by acting with \u201cdeliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students,\u201d the agency said last month.",
      "The DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division said the university had failed to \u201cadequately\u201d respond to complaints of harassment and abuse toward its Jewish and Israeli students on campus since Oct. 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cThis disgusting breach of civil rights against students will not stand: DOJ will force UCLA to pay a heavy price for putting Jewish Americans at risk and continue our ongoing investigations into other campuses in the UC system,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a news release following the July announcement.",
      "Days later, UCLA announced that it had been notified that it would be losing federal research funding over alleged antisemitism. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk said in a statement on Wednesday that the school hoped to work toward restoring the funding, warning that such a freeze would have adverse consequences.",
      "\u201cThe suspension of these funds is not only a loss to the researchers who rely on critical grants,\u201d Frenk said. \u201cIt is a loss for Americans across the nation whose work, health and future depend on our groundbreaking research and scholarship.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NFL games will be \u201cB.Y.O.S.S.\u201d in 2025.",
      "On Tuesday, the league sent a memo to its 32 clubs informing them they would no longer be allowed to administer players ammonia in any form during the 2025 season, including ammonia inhalants, which are more commonly known as smelling salts.",
      "After loud backlash from players, the NFL players\u2019 association clarified in its own memo that the league hasn\u2019t banned the use of smelling salts \u2014 it has only banned teams from being the suppliers.",
      "\u201cTo clarify, this policy does not prohibit player use of these substances, but rather it restricts clubs from providing or supplying them in any form,\u201d said the union\u2019s message to players, per ESPN. \u201cThe NFL has confirmed this to us.\u201d",
      "What does that mean for players? They can still use ammonia inhalants, as long as they bring their own.",
      "The league\u2019s decision to bar teams from doling out smelling salts came somewhat on the heels of an Food and Drug Administration warning from a year ago, which alerted consumers \u201cto not purchase or use certain inhalants, which are unapproved drugs marketed to promote alertness and boost energy.\u201d",
      "The inhalants are most often packaged in the form of a capsule comprised of ammonium carbonate and liquids. According to a 2006 editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, when the capsule is crushed, a chemical reaction is formed, releasing ammonia gas. That gas irritates the nose and lungs, which makes those parts of the body work harder. Theoretically, that could increase the amount of oxygen the body intakes.",
      "\u201cManufacturers have not demonstrated these products to be safe or effective for their intended uses,\u201d the FDA warning reads, adding that the agency received reports of inhalants causing issues such as shortness of breath, seizures, migraines, vomiting, diarrhea and fainting.",
      "Another important factor in the league\u2019s decision was that the salts could also be used to mask concussion symptoms.",
      "Players often use smelling salts for a quick jolt to their system.",
      "\u201cAs a competitive person, you need something to get you going,\u201d Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Lavonte David told reporter Kay Adams. \u201cSmelling salts wake you up and get you going right away. Ever since 2012, my rookie year, I\u2019ve had to take a smelling salt before each drive.\u201d",
      "David added: \u201cIt\u2019s a big role in a lot of our careers.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the proposed ban, several players were outspoken about their loyalty to the product.",
      "\u201cOur team got a memo today that smelling salts and ammonia packets were made illegal in the NFL, and I\u2019ve been distraught all day,\u201d San Francisco 49ers star tight end George Kittle said on NFL Network on Tuesday.",
      "He later added, in jest: \u201cI considered retirement. We have got to figure out a middle ground here, guys. Somebody help me out.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be severely affected, to be honest with you,\u201d Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield told reporter Kay Adams when asked about the ban.",
      "\u201cI think the reasoning is because it masks concussion symptoms, but if you get knocked out, which is the whole purpose of smelling salts to wake you up, you\u2019re not allowed back in the game,\u201d Mayfield added. \u201cI think it was a quick trigger to ban them.\u201d",
      "Fortunately for players such as Kittle and Mayfield, the \u201cban\u201d ended up being short-lived, as long as they are willing to bring their own to sidelines this season.",
      "As for how much the salts will actually help their performance, their effect may be more mental than physical.",
      "According to at least one study published last fall in a sports medicine journal, \u201cthe physiological and performance-enhancing effects of ammonia inhalants remain poorly understood.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmmonia inhalants have no role in medical management of head injuries and have limited benefit with regards to sports performance,\u201d reads the conclusion of the study."

      "The black hole lies at the center of a galaxy known as CAPERS-LRD-z9. Both cosmic objects are thought to have formed around 13.3 billion years ago, or just 500 million years after the big bang that created the universe.

      "The black hole discovery, described in a study published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, could shed light on the universe\u2019s earliest days and provide insight into how black holes and galaxies evolved.",
      "Light takes time to travel across space, which means observing distant objects in the cosmos is a bit like accessing a portal back in time, said Anthony Taylor, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin who led the study\u2019s international team of scientists.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at objects that are very, very far away, it has taken that light billions upon billions of years to reach us,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in reality, we\u2019re seeing these objects as they were in the early universe.\u201d",
      "As far as black holes go, this one is huge, according to the researchers. It\u2019s estimated to be up to 300 million times the size of the sun, with a mass equivalent to that of half the stars in its galaxy.",
      "It\u2019s also roughly 10 times more massive than the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Taylor said.",
      "Taylor and his colleagues found the black hole in observations of the outermost reaches of the universe from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope.

      "Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be involved.",
      "The White House official said the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire, and the U.S. is now trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed.",
      "In a statement Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News, \u201cPresident Trump has been clear since he inherited this war from Joe Biden six months ago: he wants it to end at the negotiating table. At the President\u2019s direction, Special Envoy Witkoff once again met with President Putin to discuss potential paths to peace, and the President and his national security team are discussing those paths with both the Ukrainians and the Europeans. Out of respect for our sensitive diplomatic discussions with Russia, Ukraine, and our European allies, the White House will not comment on alleged details in the news media.\u201d",

      "The White House had previously floated the possibility of a trilateral meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy, but the Kremlin dismissed that idea on Thursday.",

      "\"Cyril also shared details of his conversation with the Russian side. Ukraine\u2019s position is absolutely clear: the path to peace must begin with a ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy wrote.",

From the very first seconds of the war, we have wanted it to end, as it was not Ukraine that started this war.

      "Throughout the presidential campaign last year, Trump often told voters that one of his priorities was ending the war in Ukraine. Over the last few months, he's waffled between blaming Putin and Zelenskyy for the war's continuation.",
      "During his Oval Office remarks on Thursday, Trump said that he was \"very disappointed\" and that he expected Putin to decide by Friday about a potential ceasefire in the war.",

      "Trump had initially suggested that such a summit would only go ahead if Putin agreed to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, something the Ukrainian president\u2019s administration has long called for but has been resisted by Russia. On Thursday, Trump dispelled the idea that they would have to get together \u2014 raising the specter of a bilateral negotiation that freezes out Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThe danger for Ukraine is actually quite grave,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. \u201cThere will be a sense of alarm in European capitals.\u201d",

After his catastrophic fallout with Trump in the White House in February, Zelenskyy has \u201cjust managed to repair his relationship with Trump over the last two months in a very gingerly fashion, and it would be the worst possible thing for him to appear now to be pooh-poohing this summit.\u201d",
      "Many Ukrainians were already skeptical. Before the summit was even announced, Artem Bidenko, a political scientist and former deputy minister in Ukraine\u2019s government, predicted that Putin \u201cwill most likely offer some kind of bone\u201d to Trump, who \u201cwill say that \u2018you see, I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m already achieving peace, and people will stop dying,\u2019\u201d Bidenko said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on these criticisms.",
      "Others in Kyiv have more faith in the American leader.",
      "\u201cTrump seems to be irritated enough by the Russians\u2019 actions to dare to strike really strong blows at Russia,\u201d said Danylo Vereitin, 31, a sports journalist based in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. \u201cPeople with this type of mentality really don\u2019t like to look weak or vulnerable.\u201d",
      "During the presidential campaign last year, Trump said it would take him just 24 hours to solve the conflict, later updated that to six months and then seemingly forgot about it. Previous warm words about Putin have recently turned stern, and Trump appeared to be losing patience with Russia\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d nightly missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians while the White House was attempting to broker peace talks.",
      "This culminated in Trump\u2019s deadline, first set at 50 days on July 14, then shortened to 10 days on July 29, for Putin to agree a ceasefire or face tariffs against importers of Russian oil and gas products like China, India, Brazil and Turkey.",
      "Asked whether this deadline was still active, Trump told reporters Thursday, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him\u201d \u2014 meaning Putin \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re going to see what he has to say,\u201d adding that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d at the situation.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire, and the U.S. is now trying to get buy-in from the Ukrainians and European allies.",

      "In 2021, Russia\u2019s eight-point draft treaty looks much the same as today : a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO and a withdrawal of NATO forces on Russia\u2019s eastern flank. Today, Russia has merely added the additional demand of even more Ukrainian territory.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the idea of a ceasefire that would have Russia maintain  control over Ukrainian territory in its control, and insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",

The administration has been heavily critical of other judges, too, and has faced similar claims of failing to comply with court orders.",

      "Judge Nina Pillard, the Obama appointee, wrote in her dissent that government officials \u201cappear to have disobeyed\u201d Boasberg\u2019s order.",
      "\u201cOur system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The underlying dispute concerns Trump\u2019s aggressive and unprecedented use of presidential power in invoking a rarely used 18th-century law called the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In March, Boasberg issued his first decision preventing the administration from deporting people the government claimed were members of the Tren de Aragua gang using the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Critics immediately raised concerns about whether the administration had violated a verbal order from Boasberg in court that planes carrying alleged gang members turn around and return to the United States. Two flights subsequently landed in Honduras and El Salvador.",
      "On April 7, the Supreme Court then threw out Boasberg's original decision, saying he had followed the wrong legal process, although it made clear detainees are required to be given due process. Litigation on that point has continued in other courts.",
      "After that, Boasberg nevertheless moved forward with contempt proceedings, which is the only matter at issue in Friday's appeals court decision.",
      "The case had been paused for months, leading to complaints from Democrats that the court was inappropriately delaying action on the case in part because a key figure, then-Justice Department official Emil Bove, was under consideration by the Senate for a position as a judge on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Bove was narrowly confirmed on July 29.",
      "During that process, whistleblowers claimed Bove had told Justice Department colleagues that the government may have to defy court orders in order to carry out its deportation plans. The Justice Department denied that Bove committed any wrongdoing."

    "summary": "Federal prosecutors are in the early stages of an investigation into the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed a \"special attorney\" to probe mortgage fraud allegations against Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two administration officials told NBC News.",
      "The Justice Department is also in the initial stages of an investigation of James over her successful civil fraud case against President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter.",
      "Bondi tapped Ed Martin, a conservative activist and former interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., as special attorney to investigate Schiff and James, both prominent Democratic opponents of the president, the two administration officials said.",
      "A senior law enforcement official said a grand jury seated in the Eastern District of Virginia will investigate the James mortgage fraud allegations and a grand jury in Maryland will investigate the allegations against Schiff.",
      "Martin met Friday morning with Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who sent a criminal referral on the California senator to the Justice Department in May, the administration officials said. Pulte sent a referral on James in April, prompting the Justice Department to open an investigation on allegations that she made false statements on mortgage loan applications.",
      "Schiff and James have denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Trump had previously called for both Democratic officials to be prosecuted because of the mortgage fraud allegations. Schiff and James have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Schiff blasted Trump's claims in a video statement in July. \"This is the kind of stuff you see tinpot dictators do. It is designed to intimidate his political opponents and somehow try to silence them,\" he said then.",
      "The U.S. attorney probe of James is focused on whether her office used its authority to violate Trump's legal rights through its civil lawsuits against the president and his businesses, according to three people familiar with the matter.",
      "That investigation is also looking at whether the National Rifle Association's rights were violated by her civil suits, the three sources said. It is being run out of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of New York, two of those sources said.",
      "In response to an NBC News inquiry, a spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office said: \u201cAny weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers\u2019 rights.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office did not return a request for comment.",
      "James, a Democrat, successfully sued Trump and his company over what her office said were fraudulent misrepresentations of his wealth and financial statements. A judge awarded James\u2019 office over $300 million in the case, an amount that's since swelled to over $500 million with interest. Trump is appealing the judgment.",
      "James' office also sued the NRA and its leadership with mixed results. The attorney general had sought the dissolution of the NRA in what is commonly referred to as the corporate \u201cdeath penalty,\u201d but a judge struck down those claims.",
      "In 2024, James' office did win its civil fraud case against the longtime head of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, with a jury convicting him of diverting millions of dollars from the gun group for his own personal lifestyle.",
      "The gun group said it was \"gratified\" to find out about the investigation.",
      "\"She uses her powers as an elected official to try, in her words, to \u2018dissolve the organization in its entirety', thus silencing the voice of millions of our members,\u201d NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Doug Hamlin said in a statement. \"That she now expresses concerns over \u2018weaponization\u2019 is the height of hypocrisy--an utter lack of self-awareness at the very least.\u201d",
      "It is not immediately clear how far along the DOJ investigation into James' office is and what evidence, if any, the Justice Department has gathered in the probe.",
      "An attorney for James, Abbe Lowell, said the probe of James' fraud case against Trump and his businesses \u201chas to be the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\"",
      "\"Weaponizing the Department of Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration,\" he added.",
      "The FBI and Justice Department began its probe of the mortgage fraud allegations against James in the spring. It's unclear why Martin is now in charge of the review.",
      "Martin served as Trump's interim U.S. attorney for Washngton, D.C., earlier this year, but his nomination was withdrawn after Republican senators expressed concerns over his association with Jan. 6 rioters. Trump then announced in May that Martin was moving to the Justice Department to serve as director of a \u201cweaponization working group.\"",
      "Martin did not comment on the Friday appointment.",
      "Lowell pushed back on the allegations against James in an April letter to Bondi, acknowledging there were some mistaken forms while noting contemporaneous letters and forms showing that James submitted the correct information.",
      "The letter called the \"threadbare allegations\" the \"next salvo in President Trump\u2019s revenge tour against Attorney General James.\"",
      "In addition to her fraud case against Trump and his companies, James and her office have launched a number of successful legal challenges to his administration's agenda, dating back to his first term in office.",
      "Trump has maintained that James is biased against him. In 2021, he sued to stop her from proceeding with her fraud investigation, saying, \u201cHer mission is guided solely by political animus and a desire to harass, intimidate, and retaliate against a private citizen who she views as a political opponent.\" The lawsuit also alleged that Trump was the victim of \"viewpoint discrimination.\"",
      "Trump later dropped the suit, but has continued to criticize James, including in an April Truth Social post that called her a \"wacky\" and \"totally corrupt politician\" who should immediately resign."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has nicknamed himself \u201cthe fertilization president,\u201d but six months after he formally pledged to expand access to in vitro fertilization, the White House has yet to issue a policy to that end.",
      "Since he campaigned on the issue last year, Trump\u2019s push to support IVF has been complicated by backlash from conservatives and anti-abortion groups who see IVF as unethical, as well as members of the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement who view the pharmaceutical industry as having undue influence over fertility care.",
      "Many of these groups have instead suggested that Trump redirect his attention to a little-known holistic approach called restorative reproductive medicine. The underlying philosophy is that doctors can identify and treat the root causes of infertility, often with less invasive and more affordable methods than IVF.",
      "But restorative reproductive medicine isn\u2019t formally recognized as a medical specialty in the U.S. and has not been evaluated as extensively as IVF has. Many fertility doctors worry that holistic methods are being presented to patients as a better alternative to IVF, thereby denying patients access to a proven option in fertility care.",
      "\u201cRestorative approaches may work for certain patients, but elevating them as morally superior or universally preferable undermines the individualized, evidence-based care modern reproductive medicine is built on,\u201d said Dr. Brian Levine, the founding partner of CCRM Fertility of New York.",
      "After Trump issued an executive order in February promising to make IVF more affordable and attainable, Republican lawmakers introduced companion bills in the House and Senate that would expand access to restorative reproductive medicine and prohibit discrimination against providers who don\u2019t offer IVF. And in June, Arkansas became the first state to require insurance companies to cover restorative reproductive medicine treatments.",
      "Recent actions out of the Department of Health and Human Services suggest an aligned interest in holistic fertility methods. Calley Means, a special government employee at HHS, told Fox News in April that there was a \u201cmandate from the top\u201d to come up with \u201ca holistic fertility policy.\u201d That same month, HHS laid off the team responsible for tracking IVF success rates as part of the agency\u2019s massive restructuring.",
      "Then in July, HHS posted a grant opportunity for an \u201cinfertility training center\u201d that would educate people on a \u201cbroad range of holistic infertility treatments.\u201d The proposed center would draw from federal Title X funds, which have historically been used to provide birth control or testing for sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, said the agency released a forecast for a future funding opportunity but is not currently soliciting applications for an infertility training center.",
      "\u201cHHS is committed to prioritizing helping couples suffering from infertility,\u201d Nixon said, pointing to Trump\u2019s executive order on IVF.",
      "Some IVF supporters say they sense indecision within the Trump administration over how to proceed with a federal policy, despite the president calling himself the \u201cfather of IVF.\u201d (Decades of research laid the foundation for IVF, but the first successful IVF pregnancy took place in England in 1978.)",
      "The White House Domestic Policy Council, which advises the president on domestic issues, presented Trump with policy recommendations for supporting IVF in May. Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, an adviser to that council and a fertility specialist at Texas Fertility Center, said he recommended to White House officials that they declare infertility an essential health benefit under the Affordable Care Act and cover IVF services for military and government employees.",
      "But The Washington Post reported Sunday that the White House does not plan to require health insurers to cover IVF services, a policy Trump previously said he would implement.",
      "Silverberg said White House officials haven\u2019t told him which policies they favor.",
      "\u201cThey come at me with very insightful questions, but they don\u2019t give me anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I say to them, \u2018Hey, what are you thinking about such and such?\u2019 The pat answer that I get back is, \u2018Well, we\u2019re listening to lots of different sources, and we\u2019re trying to formulate the best solutions that we can.\u2019\u201d",
      "The White House said it has met with stakeholders across the spectrum to solicit their input.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump pledged to expand IVF access for Americans looking to start families, and the Administration remains committed to delivering on that pledge and exploring all options that address the root causes of infertility,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said.",
      "Restorative reproductive medicine may indeed be one of those options. The International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, the professional association for doctors who offer this type of fertility care, has spoken with federal officials about its methods, said Dr. Tracey Parnell, the institute\u2019s global director of communications and development.",
      "Parnell, who is Canadian, coined the term \u201crestorative reproductive medicine\u201d in the late 1990s alongside a small group of international physicians. She was surprised earlier this year when her community became part of the national conversation in the U.S., she said.",
      "\u201cWe were sort of expecting another decade to be able to get to the stage of more published information and further along the pathway to formal recognition as a specialty,\u201d Parnell said, noting that such recognition in the U.S. requires accreditation by a national board.",
      "One group responsible for increasing the visibility of restorative reproductive medicine is the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank whose policy proposals are known to influence the White House\u2019s agenda.",
      "In March, the foundation published a report highlighting what it said are the benefits of restorative reproductive medicine over a fertility industry that \u201cprofits from the creation and selection of human life.\u201d The report emboldened groups that are morally or ideologically opposed to IVF, said Levine, of CCRM Fertility.",
      "\u201cPart of the ultra-right-wing personhood movement has taken advantage of this opportunity that IVF is now ubiquitous in all of our conversations, to now jump in and say that they believe that there is a better alternative than IVF itself,\u201d Levine said.",
      "Many members of the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also favor holistic methods.",
      "In late June, the Heritage Foundation and the MAHA Institute \u2014 a policy center that backs initiatives that align with the MAHA movement \u2014 held a roundtable discussion on women\u2019s fertility. Many of the speakers there advocated for restorative reproductive medicine and warned of the risks of hormonal birth control. At least one high-powered federal official, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s principal deputy commissioner, Sara Brenner, was in attendance and expressed support for the topics discussed.",
      "\u201cThe goals of the Make America Health Again movement \u2014 to return to holistic, root-cause medical care for men and women \u2014 align with the goals and approach of restorative reproductive medicine, even if there are notable differences and distinctions between those two movements,\u201d said Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Parnell, of the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said the group\u2019s methods don\u2019t prevent people from pursuing IVF, but rather give them options.",
      "Practitioners of restorative reproductive medicine say their methods are individualized to the patient and don\u2019t rush to diagnose women with infertility if they can\u2019t conceive right away. They often ask patients to carefully track their menstrual cycles, body temperature and changes in cervical mucus to help determine when they\u2019re ovulating. They also look to diagnose and treat medical conditions that may impact fertility, such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis.",
      "Where necessary, practitioners may suggest changes to patients\u2019 diets, recommend vitamins or supplements or prescribe hormone medications that improve ovulation. In some cases, they may advise surgery to diagnose endometriosis and remove scar tissue that can block an egg\u2019s path to the uterus.",
      "But IVF doctors said the restorative approach can take time, which some patients may not have if they have a diminished number or quality of eggs. Many of the tactics of restorative reproductive medicine, like prescribing hormones or dietary changes, are already used in fertility clinics nationwide, they added.",
      "Silverberg, of Texas Fertility Center, said restorative reproductive medicine is \u201ca made-up term for something that\u2019s been going on for decades.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy concern is that the people who focus solely on restorative reproductive health want things to stop right there. They unfortunately advocate ignoring all of the medical advances that have happened in the last 40 years,\u201d Silverberg said, adding that he shared these thoughts with White House officials.",
      "Monica Minjeur, the U.S. director of communications and development for the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said there is data to show that the approach works. In a study of more than 400 women with a history of infertility, most of whom had been unsuccessful with IVF, roughly 32% gave birth after turning to restorative reproductive medicine. The odds of having a child via an additional cycle of IVF were roughly the same, according to the paper, which Parnell co-authored. (The average success rate of a woman\u2019s first IVF cycle is around 30%.)",
      "Despite its conservative fan base, Minjeur said, restorative reproductive medicine is not inherently political or religious, and her organization is cautious about these associations.",
      "\u201cWe are a science-based medical organization who is trying to just get the good word out to the people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf and where that aligns with government priorities to help people who want to build families, great, we\u2019ll take it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Deaths from \u201cflesh-eating\u201d bacteria are on the rise across the southeastern coasts of the U.S. At least five people in Florida, four in Louisiana and one in the Outer Banks have died this year from infections that can cause necrotizing wounds.",
      "The culprit, the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, thrives in warm seawater. Florida has seen 16 cases this year, according to the state\u2019s health department. Seventeen cases have been reported in Louisiana \u2014 more than previous years\u2019 annual averages. North Carolina has seen seven cases this year so far, the state Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to NBC News. And Mississippi has had three cases so far this year, the state\u2019s health department says.",
      "Initial deaths from the infection in Florida were reported in counties spread around the state\u2019s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in Southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville.",
      "The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It\u2019s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.",
      "About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, according to the CDC.",
      "Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida, said that infections are still rare but \u201csomething is off this year.\u201d Still, he said there are too many unknowns to be certain what's causing the rise in infections at this time.",
      "\u201cThis is certainly not normal, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d Jutla said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that many cases early on in the summer for a very long time.\u201d",
      "Jutla said Vibrio vulnificus infections tend to increase after hurricanes. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the \u201cextremely active\u201d hurricane season. The bacteria can linger in hurricane floodwaters.",
      "\u201cSomething happened this year that triggered the pathogens a little bit more than before,\u201d he said.",
      "Hurricane season this year is still expected to be above normal as the U.S. enters its peak period, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday.",
      "Jutla\u2019s research group is investigating why there are high concentrations of plankton and chlorophyll \u2014 indicators for vibrio \u2014 across Florida\u2019s panhandle. He calls it a \u201cconcern.\u201d",
      "What is Vibrio vulnificus?",
      "Vibrio vulnificus is one of over 200 species of Vibrio bacteria, said Rita Colwell, a professor emerita of microbiology at the University of Maryland.",
      "The majority of Vibrio infections aren\u2019t harmful to humans, Jutla said. Some only affect other animals.",
      "But Vibrio bacteria do cause about 80,000 infections in people each year, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Most of those cases are gastrointestinal. Only a small handful \u2014 100 to 200 cases \u2014 are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.",
      "Because Vibrio bacteria prefer warm water, they are typically found along the southeastern shores of the U.S., but they are also found on the West Coast. As ocean temperatures warm, more cases have been found farther north in recent years, Jutla said, including some in New York, Connecticut and Maryland.",
      "Who is at risk?",
      "Vibrio bacteria can creep in open wounds after spending time in salty or brackish water, said Dr. Norman Beatty, an infectious disease doctor at University of Florida Health. Most cases he\u2019s seen have been associated with spending extended time in the water, but he says that even a brief exposure could be the \u201conly thing needed.\u201d",
      "Visible signs of an infection can start in just a few hours, Beatty said, and include redness, swelling and \u201cbull\u2019s-eye\u201d blisters. The site will also be painful. If infection progresses, it can get into the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can be deadly. Symptoms of sepsis include fever, chills and dangerously low blood pressure, according to the CDC.",
      "People with liver cirrhosis, weakened immune systems and those over 65 are most at risk for infection, Jutla said.",
      "Vibrio vulnificus infections can be treated with antibiotics.",
      "How to prevent Vibrio infections",
      "Beatty said he recommends covering up any open wounds before going into the ocean. Even a waterproof Band-Aid does the job, he said.",
      "If people think they have an infection, they should seek care immediately, Beatty said. Delaying can be the difference between developing severe complications and a more mild infection.",
      "\u201cA delay in presenting to health care is truly the likely reason why most people have a more serious outcome than others,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who present within the same day with signs and symptoms of early infection, who receive antibiotics, can do well and can avoid a lot of these serious complications.\u201d"

      "Starz's new series, set to premiere on Aug. 8, expands characters' backstories and revisits the fateful events that defined the original series. Most importantly, it follows how Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan) and Claire Beauchamp (Caitriona Balfe) parents met and fell in love.",
      "The prequel begs the question: Will fans watching both \"Outlander\" and \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood\u201d ever get a crossover moment?",

      "The showrunner confirmed that the eighth and final season of \"Outlander\" has already been wrapped filming, making retroactive crossover scenes or \u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d character appearances essentially impossible.",
      "Roberts adds that while the lens of \"Outlander\" kept a tight focus on Jamie and Claire, \u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d allows the show's creatives to expand on and explore new characters and storylines.",
      "\"I would like to explore all these characters (in the 'Outlander' universe),\" Roberts explains. \"One of the things in 'Outlander' that we kept to is Jamie and Claire.

      "In the sequel, which hit theaters Friday, Aug. 8, the mother-daughter duo have a new yet eerily similar set of problems on their hands.",
      "Anna now has a daughter of her own, Harper (Julia Butters), making Tess a grandma. In \"Freaky Friday,\" Tess getting remarried caused strain for the family and similarly, in the sequel, tension arises as Anna plans a wedding with a single dad whose daughter goes to Harper\u2019s school.",
      "The caveat? Anna's new fianc\u00e9, Eric (Manny Jacinto), is the father of Harper's arch nemesis, Lily (Sophia Hammons). And so, naturally, the attempt to form a family of four doesn't bode well for the high schoolers.",

      "Like Mother, Like Daughter",
      "Despite Anna constantly telling her mom she's \"ruining my life\" in \"Freaky Friday,\" the adult character is more like Tess than she'd probably like to admit.",
      "The 2003 film begins with Tess trying several times to wake a reluctant Anna up for school. Similarly, the sequel opens with Anna attempting to wake her daughter, Harper, up. In the new movie, though, Harper is already up but snuck out to go surfing.",

      "In the 2004 movie, Lohan's character, Cady Heron is talking to her crush, Aaron Samuels, in math class. In the seemingly insignificant interaction, he asks her the date, and Cady's response has since served as a major quote from the film.",
      "\u201cOn October 3rd, he asked me what day it was,\u201d a voiceover of Lohan says in the film, giddy over her conversation with Aaron.",

      "\u201cParent Trap\u201d fans will likely notice a familiar face in \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d: Elaine Hendrix, aka Meredith Blake.",
      "In the 1998 remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Lohan played twins Hallie and Annie. Hendrix portrayed Meredith, the unlikable fianc\u00e9 to the twins\u2019 dad.",

      "In the first film, Anna \u2014 while still in Tess\u2019 body \u2014 had to be on guitar backstage to cover for her mom being unable to play. In the sequel, Anna \u2014 now in Harper's body \u2014 has to cover for her daughter. This time, however, the mom and daughter share a sweet moment performing together.",

      "The photos thrilled their fans for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, their characters, Capt. Olivia Benson and Detective Elliot Stabler, haven\u2019t physically been in the same scene on \u201cSVU\u201d since the Season 24 finale back in 2023 (yes, you read that right).",
      "Secondly, the beloved pair also reunited with one of their OG \u201cSVU\u201d co-stars, Dann Florek, who portrayed Special Victims Unit boss Capt. Donald Cragen until the character\u2019s retirement in Season 15. Meloni shared photos of himself with Hargitay and Florek on his Instagram page Aug. 2.",
      "\u201cHangin with friends on a Friday nite,\u201d he captioned the trio of pics.",
      "Florek last made an appearance on \u201cSVU\u201d via FaceTime during the show\u2019s 500th episode in 2021, and he\u2019s made some appearances on \u201cOC\u201d for some sentimental scenes with Meloni.",
      "He appeared to be casually dressed in his photos with Meloni and Hargitay, who were both sporting suits and looked to be in character.",
      "Hargitay posted about being together again with Meloni on Instagram Aug. 4, sharing a photo of her and her longtime friend holding hands and smiling.",
      "\u201cReunited,\u201d she wrote, along with two blue heart emoji.",
      "New Photos Show Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni, or Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler, Hugging",
      "Now, to one of the most important points in this very unserious investigation: What is the story behind the photos of these two hugging?",
      "Cameras are visible in one of the pictures, which could mean fans will get just their fifth canon Benson-Stabler hug in 27 seasons. (We will never forget the one hug that was taken from us.)",
      "What Is Happening With Benson and Stabler's Relationship?",
      "There are also lingering questions about Benson and Stabler\u2019s relationship status. While Meloni guest-starred last season in a scene to rough up a guy who approached Benson\u2019s son, one of Stabler\u2019s last big \u201cSVU\u201d moments with Benson happened when they almost kissed in her kitchen back in Season 24.",
      "She later told him that was \u201ca bad time\u201d for her, and Stabler said it was \u201cjust not the right moment.\u201d (OK, then when is the right moment?)",
      "Let us not forget the compass necklace, a gift from Stabler to Benson in the Season 24 finale crossover event with \u201cOC.\u201d He told her he hoped it would lead her to happiness.",
      "Hargitay told TODAY.com in January 2024 that she and Meloni designed that necklace together.",
      "\u201cI wanted Chris\u2019 impact because he\u2019s so thoughtful and specific and does such a deep dive on things like this that matter,\u201d Hargitay said. \u201cI wanted it to mean as much to him as it meant to me. So he\u2019s the one that came up with what the (symbols on the compass) stood for.\u201d",
      "Meloni later told us the necklace symbolizes \u201ctrue north.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the star by which you navigate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a fitting \u2014 we\u2019ve both been navigating turbulent seas, whether it\u2019s in the storytelling part of it or in the personal life part of the storytelling. I think the sense of navigation.\u201d",
      "Benson loaned the necklace to a victim\u2019s mother in the Season 25 finale, and it hasn\u2019t been seen since. (We think it\u2019s the right moment to bring that back \u2014 unless she has found her happiness with a certain bald-headed detective.)",
      "When Were Benson and Stabler Last on Screen Together?",
      "Hargitay and Meloni\u2019s characters last shared the screen in the most recent season of \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d in an episode Meloni wrote.",
      "Stabler spent part of the episode in a coma, and Meloni told TODAY.com in April that Benson was his character\u2019s \u201cicebreaker\u201d that could \u201calmost break through\u201d Stabler\u2019s coma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s her voice that he hears,\u201d he said.",
      "Benson and Stabler also shared some uncharacteristically silly scenes, like when Stabler wanted to leave the hospital and told Benson she could help him out or \u201cjust stand there and watch me get naked.\u201d",
      "Meloni described that moment as \u201ca nod to the fans.\u201d",
      "It was also important for him to write the episode featuring Hargitay because he said he \u201cinevitably\u201d rewrites their characters\u2019 scenes.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a natural and correct evolution to get to gain greater insight into their engagements \u2014 maybe not where they\u2019re going and all that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are bigger-ticket items. How they speak to each other, how they feel about each other.\u201d",
      "One thing is for certain: It\u2019s about time viewers get some answers about what\u2019s going on with these two. And we can only hope that Season 27 of \u201cSVU,\u201d which premieres Sept. 25 on NBC, will give us some."

    "story": [
      "Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d has found its place on the platform\u2019s Top 10 list.",
      "Since its July 21 release, the television series, based on the novel by May Cobb, has evolved into a cultural moment, racking up over 11 million views on Netflix, per Deadline.",
      "On TikTok, thousands of viewers are sharing their thoughts on show\u2019s roller coaster of twists and soap-level drama.",
      "Where did all this buzz come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the show's appeal and the phenomenon it sparked.",
      "What is \u2018The Hunting Wives\u2019 about?",
      "Originally created for Starz, the erotic thriller was acquired by Netflix.",
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" follows PR exec Sophie O\u2019Neil (Brittany Snow) as she moves from Boston to East Texas with her architect husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit). She immediately finds herself out of place in an inner circle of wealthy Southern housewives who call themselves the \"Hunting Wives.\"",
      "These women seemingly couldn't be more different from Sophie: Not only does the elite clique embrace gun culture, but also they also adopt an unabashed stay-at-home lifestyle that is foreign to her. When Sophie asks her new friends what they do for work, they emphasize that their job is to \u201cwife.\u201d",
      "Along with culture shock, Sophie grapples with her looming dark past through frequent flashbacks.",
      "Sophie eventually becomes enthralled by the group\u2019s queen bee, Margo Banks (Malin A\u030akerman), the wife of Graham\u2019s boss, Jed (Dermot Mulroney), an oil tycoon running for the governor of Texas. Margo takes Sophie under her wing, and their friendship quickly escalates into a steamy affair.",
      "A throughline of the show is its twisty murder plot. After local teenager Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, Sophie finds herself inconveniently tangled in the mystery. As the town searches for the culprit, its residents cultivate messy love triangles and secret relationships on the side.",
      "Why has 'The Hunting Wives' become such a phenomenon?",
      "Part of the appeal of the \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is that it goes there \u2014  all manner of daring places.",
      "Each character is shamelessly committed to making jaw-dropping decisions. Take, for example, Margo\u2019s affair with an 18-year-old high school student who also happens to be Abby\u2019s boyfriend. Or Sophie\u2019s decision to rashly secure a firearm, a choice that backfires after she blacks out on the night of Abby\u2019s death ... and her gun turns out to be the murder weapon.",
      "Then, of course, there are the show\u2019s multiple murders and frequent extramarital escapades.",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u2019 consistently prioritizes steamy scenes over sensible plotting or nuanced characters, juicy twists over deep emotions or big ideas. It might all be incredibly frustrating, if it were not also so wildly entertaining,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter writes of the show.",
      "The show\u2019s hype is not necessarily due to its quality: Some fans on Reddit point out, Margo\u2019s wig looks (perhaps purposefully) unrealistic, and there may be more than a few plot holes.",
      "Instead, the series\u2019 shock factor is what makes it bingeable.",
      "\u201cLook, it isn\u2019t Emmy award winning TV. The acting only ranges slightly fair. The characters are terrible people,\u201d one Reddit user writes. \u201cBut I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t sucked in from the very first episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything has been said regarding it being the perfect summer sleazy schlockfest we all love,\u201d another adds.",
      "In addition to its wild plot twists, the show\u2019s depiction of Margo and Sophie\u2019s queer relationship has led to chatter.",
      "Them, an LGBTQ+ publication, writes that \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d might be \u201cthe gayest show of the year.\" Many fans have posted their reactions to Margo and Sophie\u2019s relationship, crediting the show's suggestive scenes for their sexual awakenings or awkward watch moments with family members.",
      "\u201cWith all of the attention the show is receiving, viewer reactions have proved feverish, with fans across party lines gamely questioning their sexuality after witnessing Margo\u2019s effects on Sophie,\u201d NBC Out writes of this phenomenon.",
      "Watchers also have also found themselves enthralled by the series\u2019 political message.",
      "\u201cWhen you first start watching the show, it\u2019s just a very fun, campy romp\u2026 It really feels like they are glamorizing this certain type of lifestyle. But, in actuality, it is such a scathing review of the hypocrisy of the nuclear family (and) God fearing Republicans,\u201d one reviewer theorizes on TikTok.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the show\u2019s most intriguing wrinkle involves incorporating just enough political references to feel like a satire of Southern-fried hypocrisy,\u201d Slate writes.",
      "This layer adds, for some, enough to turn the show from a beach read on screen to something a little deeper.",
      "However, not everyone is a fan \u2014 some criticize the show for being too vulgar or underdeveloped.",
      "But the show\u2019s blend of lustful romance, a messy murder plot and perhaps a bit of political humor is what has many fans knocking on Netflix\u2019s door for another salacious installment."

      "This moment for the trend is different because it covers a wider range of locations than the classic \"New York vs. LA\" debate. Users have created videos inspired by their experiences in places like Atlanta, Texas, France and Kansas \u2014 and yes, New York and Los Angeles.",
      "Some are spoofs on the idea of conventional beauty \u2014 one version of a Colorado 10, for example, is in athletic clothes and no makeup. Another idea of a New York 10 is having an apartment with amenities like a washing machine and garbage disposal. Others are saying they're a worldwide 10 \u2014 then dressing up as Mr. Worldwide, Pitbull.",
      "One user who participated in the trend is @maycietilley, who posted a video of herself turning into a \u201cUtah 7,\" as other users have done.",
      "\u201cThe beauty standard in Utah and its culture is very high, especially compared to other states,\u201d Tilley tells TODAY.com. \u201cI see people on FYP page all the time talking about how they can instantly tell when someone is from Utah or its culture because of how they look or dress.\u201d",
      "What does the trend say about beauty?",
      "Commentators have mixed opinions on what the viral moment says about beauty.",
      "Brand strategist Mara Dettman shared her perspective on the trend on her Substack, \"In Interesting Times.\" She wrote the idea of ranking someone based on attractiveness is \u201cinherently problematic.\u201d However, she also wrote that this trend takes ranking beauty and \u201cplays with it, critiques it, and perpetuates it, all at once.\u201d",
      "Dettmann tells TODAY.com this trend says anyone can be a \u201c10,\" as modern standards of beauty are defined by styling or charm and not physical traits.",
      "\u201cIt brings up really interesting questions about, when it comes to beauty: What\u2019s innate? What\u2019s performative?\u201d Dettmann says.",
      "Phelps also notes that the trend is nuanced.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always sort of a dangerous thing when we\u2019re ranking humans, and when we are creating hierarchies around bodies,\u201d Phelps said.",
      "She also touches on the agency and performance involved in this trend \u2014 people are bringing a cheeky self-awareness to beauty standards.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s less about how people embody a particular beauty standard and more so how they construct it, how they make it happen,\u201d Phelps adds.",
      "Dettmann says the regional aspect of the trend marks a shift away from one singular standard of beauty, best represented by Instagram face, the theory that all influencers and celebrities are starting to look the same due to similar cosmetic treatments.",
      "\u201cEven in the age of people being chronically online, regional culture and differences still matter,\u201d Dettmann says. \u201cIn a sea of sameness, we\u2019re getting more similar in some ways but also retaining unique differences.\u201d",
      "Additionally, some users who make fun of the trend reject the ranking mindset, Dettmann adds, by asking \u201cwhy do you even want to be a 10?\u201d",
      "TikToker Sam Puckett, for example, posted a video of herself transforming into her idea of a \"Texas 10 \"\u2014 the beaver mascot for the beloved Southern chain Buc-ees.",
      "\u201cYou can make anything or anyone a 10 if you fully commit and have the confidence,\u201d Puckett tells TODAY.com. \"My 10 for the trend is the Buc-ees Beaver and let me tell you he is getting hyped up in the comments.\u201d",
      "Phelps adds that humorous approaches make a statement on the idea of ranking beauty.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve found great about this as well is the way people are immediately putting humor into it and are responding in ways that are funny, resistant,\u201d Phelps says. \u201cThey\u2019re contradicting the trend at the same time that they\u2019re doing it.\u201d"

      "For Kyiv, this was Trump\u2019s deadline to Putin: stop the fighting by Friday or face tough new economic sanctions. Instead, Trump has handed Moscow a diplomatic coup by agreeing to meet Putin face-to-face in a matter of days, their first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump had initially suggested that such a summit would only go ahead if Putin agreed to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, something the Ukrainian president\u2019s administration has long called for but has been resisted by Russia. On Thursday, Trump dispelled the idea that they would have to get together \u2014 raising the specter of a bilateral negotiation that freezes out Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThe danger for Ukraine is actually quite grave,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. \u201cThere will be a sense of alarm in European capitals.\u201d",
      "For Eyal and others, Ukraine\u2019s nightmare is now one step closer to reality: \u201cTrump will be so pleased by what he perceives as the great achievement of getting Putin to the negotiating table, that he grabs any kind of offer that is made,\u201d, Eyal said. \u201cThe danger of half-baked compromise, which Trump can claim as his main achievement, is very high.\u201d",
      "That compromise could be a temporary ceasefire that would allow Russia to restock its army and give its economy a break from international sanctions, according to Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey.",
      "Even if there is no truce agreement, \u201ca meeting with Trump \u2014 no matter the outcome \u2014 would be a big diplomatic victory for Putin,\u201d Gabriella Ramirez, Hope for Ukraine\u2019s executive assistant, said in an email. \u201cPutin wants to break his diplomatic isolation\u201d and such a meeting \u201cwill stroke his ego.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmeeting with Putin is a trap; President Trump must not fall for it,\u201d Ramirez added.",
      "Ukraine now finds itself in a bind.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy cannot appear to be torpedoing what is a Trump initiative,\u201d Eyal said. After his catastrophic fallout with Trump in the White House in February, Zelenskyy has \u201cjust managed to repair his relationship with Trump over the last two months in a very gingerly fashion, and it would be the worst possible thing for him to appear now to be pooh-poohing this summit.\u201d",
      "Many Ukrainians were already skeptical. Before the summit was even announced, Artem Bidenko, a political scientist and former deputy minister in Ukraine\u2019s government, predicted that Putin \u201cwill most likely offer some kind of bone\u201d to Trump, who \u201cwill say that \u2018you see, I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m already achieving peace, and people will stop dying,\u2019\u201d Bidenko said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on these criticisms.",
      "Others in Kyiv have more faith in the American leader.",
      "\u201cTrump seems to be irritated enough by the Russians\u2019 actions to dare to strike really strong blows at Russia,\u201d said Danylo Vereitin, 31, a sports journalist based in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. \u201cPeople with this type of mentality really don\u2019t like to look weak or vulnerable.\u201d",
      "During the presidential campaign last year, Trump said it would take him just 24 hours to solve the conflict, later updated that to six months and then seemingly forgot about it. Previous warm words about Putin have recently turned stern, and Trump appeared to be losing patience with Russia\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d nightly missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians while the White House was attempting to broker peace talks.",
      "This culminated in Trump\u2019s deadline, first set at 50 days on July 14, then shortened to 10 days on July 29, for Putin to agree a ceasefire or face tariffs against importers of Russian oil and gas products like China, India, Brazil and Turkey.",
      "Asked whether this deadline was still active, Trump told reporters Thursday, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him\u201d \u2014 meaning Putin \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re going to see what he has to say,\u201d adding that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d at the situation.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire, and the U.S. is now trying to get buy-in from the Ukrainians and European allies.",
      "But Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give Trump a meeting.",
      "\u201cNothing has changed since, frankly, December 2021, when Putin offered his ultimatum and said, \u2018Give me what I want or else Ukraine gets it,\u201d said James Nixey, a U.K.-based consultant specializing on Russia.",
      "\u201cTrump has done everything to pressure Russia, short of actually doing anything to pressure Russia,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s made all sorts of pronouncements, threats and Truth Social posts, but not actually undertaken any specific act which harms Russia.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Russia\u2019s eight-point draft treaty looks much the same as today : a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO and a withdrawal of NATO forces on Russia\u2019s eastern flank. Today, Russia has merely added the additional demand of even more Ukrainian territory.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the idea of a ceasefire that would have Russia maintain  control over Ukrainian territory in its control, and insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "\u201cPutin wants Ukraine, Ukraine wants to exist, Trump wants an end to the war and to be able to deal with Russia,\u201d Nixey said. \u201cAll of the major players have different agendas and none of them are aligned on anything.\u201d"

      "HIROSHIMA, Japan \u2014 For more than half a century, chimes have rung out across the Japanese city of Hiroshima every morning at exactly 8:15.",
      "The solemn ritual marks the precise moment Aug. 6, 1945, when the U.S. bomber Enola Gay dropped the world\u2019s first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, killing about 70,000 people instantly.",
      "On Wednesday, people in Hiroshima commemorated the 80th anniversary of the devastating attack, as nuclear fears mount globally amid unresolved military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "In a one-minute silent tribute, the city remembered the widescale death and destruction caused by the 10,000-pound bomb, which created a huge mushroom cloud that rose to more than 60,000 feet.",
      "\u201cIt is our duty to convey the reality of the atomic bombings not only to the people of Japan but also to the people of the world,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in a speech.",
      "Initially meant to strike a T-shaped bridge, the bomb veered instead toward an exhibition hall with a distinctive dome, which after the explosion was the only building still standing within a 1-mile radius.",
      "The blast unleashed a whirlwind of fire and force, incinerating thousands of people. Then came the radioactive black rain, which fell over the city, silently poisoning countless more.",
      "Teruko Yahata was 8 years old at the time.",
      "Yahata, who is now in her 80s, says she still has a scar from when she was hurled by the blast. Fearing another bomb, she huddled under a blanket with her family.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant to die,\u201d Yahata said, \u201cbut the warmth I felt at us dying together \u2026 I still remember to this day.\u201d",
      "Three days after bombing Hiroshima, the U.S. unleashed a second atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki that killed another 40,000 people immediately.",
      "The unprecedented bombings hastened Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender and the end of World War II, most historians say, though at the price of nearly a quarter-million lives.",
      "From the ashes, Hiroshima was rebuilt into a busy city of more than a million people, drawing tourists from around the world.",
      "Near the hypocenter, where the bomb detonated about 2,000 feet above, is a peace memorial park and museum that includes the iconic atomic dome. Using virtual reality headsets, visitors can immerse themselves in the bombing and its brutal aftermath while touring the park.",
      "Yet, the bombing still feels visceral to Hiroshima survivors, who are called hibakusha, or \u201cbomb affected persons.\u201d Now more than 86 years old on average, they have spent most of their lives struggling with illness, depression and discrimination.",
      "Kunihiko Iida, whose father was killed in the war and whose mother and older sister died shortly after the bombing, is now 83, defying predictions that he would not live to the age of 20.",
      "Those who say the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t know the reality of a nuclear bomb.\u201d",
      "Last year, the work of Japanese survivors\u2019 group Nihon Hidankyo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Toshiyuki Mimaki, the group\u2019s co-chair, is among those advocating nuclear disarmament and making sure that Hiroshima is neither forgotten nor repeated.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a very dangerous situation with Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a single nuclear bomb would mean disaster.\u201d",
      "According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the world\u2019s nine nuclear-armed states \u2014 Russia, the United States, China, France, Britain, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2014 spent more than $100 billion on nuclear weapons last year, up 11% from 2023.",
      "The increase in spending on nuclear weapons contrasts with public attitudes about them. In a June survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, 69% of respondents said the development of nuclear weapons had made the world less safe, compared with 10% who said it had made the world safer.",
      "Nearly 70% of Japan\u2019s atomic bomb survivors believe nuclear weapons could be used again, according to a poll this year by Japanese news agency Kyodo News.",
      "Hiroshima survivor Setsuko Thurlow, 93, lost 10 members of her family in the bombing. She said she remembered seeing a procession of people fleeing to the hillside who \u201clooked like ghosts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s hair was just standing up, raised upwards, and the skin and the flesh was coming off from the bones,\u201d she said.",
      "Thurlow, who went to the U.S. to study in 1954 \u2014 the same year the U.S. tested a hydrogen bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the one that destroyed Hiroshima \u2014 has spent her life campaigning for nuclear disarmament, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 on behalf of ICAN.",
      "\u201cI beg world leaders to stop and come to the negotiation table. Diplomacy needs to have greater attention,\u201d she said in a video interview from Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s not nuclear weapons, but diplomacy, exchange of words and ideas.\u201d",
      "The number of hibakusha is dwindling, raising fears that living memory of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings will soon be gone. As of the end of March, there were 99,130 survivors nationwide, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.",
      "Responsibility for remembering is being taken up by young people such as 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, who has been giving foreign visitors free guided tours of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park since he was 7.",
      "Sasaki said that even though his great-grandmother was among those killed in the bombing, for a long time his family barely acknowledged it.",
      "\u201cThe scariest thing that might happen in the future is to forget what happened a long time ago,\u201d Sasaki said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to have the same experience as my great-grandmother.\u201d",
      "Sasaki\u2019s is not the only family that has avoided talking about that day. More than 70% of the respondents in the Kyodo poll said they had never spoken about their experiences.",
      "Even so, some feel it is their duty to speak up.",
      "\u201cAs long as I live, I want to continue telling,\u201d Yahata said. \u201cI\u2019m a survivor.\u201d",

      "But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India; moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan; and mocked India\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d economy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In a sharp response, India, a major U.S. security partner, said such criticism was \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.\u201d",

      "Within weeks, Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting. He has also imposed a lower tariff rate on Pakistan of 19% and said the U.S. had reached a deal with Pakistan on exploring its oil reserves.",
      "Squeezed over Russia",

Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Global markets largely shrugged off the new tariffs, with European and Asian shares mostly higher on Thursday, CNBC reported. U.S. stock futures were also up slightly.",
      "But Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Police in southwestern China scuffled this week with protesters demanding greater justice for a 14-year-old girl bullied by her schoolmates, the latest in a series of such incidents that have drawn national attention.",
      "The unusual public outrage was set off by videos widely shared on Chinese social media showing a group of teenage girls verbally and physically attacking the victim in Jiangyou, a city in Sichuan province.",
      "Local residents, some of whom were spurred by what authorities said were false reports that the alleged attackers\u2019 families had official ties, have faced off with police they accuse of letting them off too lightly.",
      "\u201cYour children will meet children of officials who are more senior than you. What if they beat your children?\u201d a man said from behind a barricade in a video verified by NBC News.",
      "Other verified videos, many of which Chinese censors swiftly took down, showed a large crowd gathered in Jiangyou on Monday night, at times singing the Chinese national anthem as the police presence grew. Some people could be seen struggling with police officers on the ground before being taken away.",
      "Reached by phone Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Sichuan Public Security Department declined to comment and referred to earlier statements.",
      "Local police in Jiangyou said the incident took place July 22, when a 15-year-old girl surnamed Liu and two others, ages 13 and 14, assaulted the 14-year-old victim, surnamed Lai, in a vacant building. Bystanders recorded the incident and uploaded it online, police said in a statement Monday.",
      "The assault caused multiple contusions to Lai\u2019s scalp and knees, police said, though all injuries were \u201cminor.\u201d After an investigation, authorities \u201cpromptly\u201d expressed sympathy for the victim and took action, the statement said.",
      "Liu and another alleged perpetrator, who were subject to \u201cpublic security penalties,\u201d are being sent to a special school for corrective education, the police said, while the remaining bystanders were \u201ccriticized and educated.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear what exactly the punishment entails and why one of the three alleged abusers was not penalized. Under Chinese law, anyone who engages in severe group fighting can be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 1,000 yuan ($139), but juvenile offenders are exempted from detention and sent for corrective education, instead.",
      "Cyber police in the city of Mianyang, which administers Jiangyou, said in a statement Tuesday that the parents of the three alleged attackers were not lawyers or police officers but that \u201ctwo are unemployed, two work outside the province, one is a local shop assistant, and one is a local food delivery worker.\u201d",
      "They said two internet users accused of posting the false information had been \u201cadministratively punished.\u201d",
      "The attack has been widely discussed on Chinese social media, where commenters expressed anger over what they considered relatively light penalties.",
      "\u201cOnly a heavy penalty can serve as a warning,\u201d a user wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cThis is really abhorrent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly infuriating and heartbreaking,\u201d another said. \u201cIf such behaviors go unpunished, we will eventually pay a heavy price.\u201d",
      "More than 50% of Chinese students have endured school bullying, including verbal abuse, social exclusion and threats of violence, according to a recent survey by the state-backed China Youth & Children Research Center.",
      "The issue of bullying has been getting more attention in China after several high-profile cases.",
      "In January, violent protests erupted in the northwestern province of Shaanxi over a teenage student who fell to his death at a vocational school after a \u201cverbal and physical altercation\u201d with another student. Investigators ruled out any crime.",
      "In December, a Chinese court in the northern province of Hebei sentenced a teenager to life imprisonment and another to 12 years over the murder of their 13-year-old schoolmate, who was buried in an abandoned greenhouse after being killed by a shovel.",
      "A third suspect, who like the others was 13 at the time of the crime, was sentenced to corrective education.",
      "Chinese authorities acknowledge that some minors take advantage of the lower penalties generally available for those under 16 and commit multiple offenses before that age, state-run broadcaster CCTV News reported in June.",
      "The country\u2019s top legislature passed an amendment that month that would allow minors ages 14 to 16 to be detained over \u201cserious and harmful\u201d offenses starting next year."

      "France\u2019s biggest wildfire in years was spreading quickly Wednesday in a Mediterranean region near Spain after leaving one person dead and several injured, authorities said. The fire burned an area larger than Paris, and the military was called in to help.",
      "French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou deplored a \u201cdisaster on an unprecedented scale\u201d in the region.",
      "Over 2,100 firefighters and several water bomber aircraft battled the blaze that broke out Tuesday afternoon in the village of Ribaute in the Aude region, a rural, wooded area that is home to wineries.",
      "The fire, which has burned 39,500 acres, remained \u201cvery active\u201d on Wednesday and continued to progress as night fell, the local administration said. The weather was hot, dry and windy, making it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze.",
      "Villagers sought to help douse the flames or save their homes and small businesses, and described their alarm at the fire\u2019s speed. Ash filled the air and coated windows and cars, and several roads were closed around the region.",
      "\u201cThe sky was blue, and then less than an hour later the sky was orange,\u201d said Andy Pickup of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, at the heart of the fire zone. \u201cThat\u2019s when we went out and tried to help.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe heard pops and cracks \u2014 it was the trees, it was the village,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cWe could see the fires taking hold on all the hills around Saint-Laurent.\u201d At dusk, he said, they saw fires in every direction, some as near as 100 yards away.",
      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the military will reinforce efforts starting from Thursday, with several dozen soldiers to be deployed.",
      "One person died in their home, and at least 13 others were injured, including 11 firefighters, local authorities said. Three people were missing, the prefecture said.",
      "Jacques Piraux, mayor of the village of Jonqui\u00e8res, said all residents have been evacuated.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scene of sadness and desolation,\u201d he told broadcaster BFM TV after visiting there on Wednesday morning. \u201cIt looks like a lunar landscape, everything is burned. More than half or three-quarters of the village has burned down. It\u2019s hellish.\u201d",
      "Residents and tourists in nearby areas were requested to remain in their homes unless told to evacuate. Two campgrounds were evacuated as a precaution.",
      "The prime minister met Wednesday afternoon with firefighters and residents at Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, where the fire service\u2019s command post has been set up. He said he came to express \u201cnational solidarity.\u201d",
      "The area\u2019s economy is relying on winery and tourism and \u201cboth sectors are affected,\u201d he stressed.",
      "Bayrou said an investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the fire.",
      "The environment ministry said the Aude region has been experiencing a drought this month, with water use restrictions in place. Lack of rainfall in recent months \u201cplayed a major role in the spreading of the fire, since the vegetation is very dry,\u201d the statement said.",
      "This week\u2019s fire was the biggest since the creation of a national fire database in 2006, according to the national emergency service.",
      "Southern Europe has seen multiple large fires this summer. Scientists warn that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires. Last month, a wildfire that reached the southern port of Marseille, France\u2019s second-largest city, left around 300 people injured.",
      "Europe is the world\u2019s fastest-warming continent, with temperatures increasing at twice the speed of the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lived here for 10 years and we\u2019ve seen nothing like that,\u2019\u2019 Pickup said. \u2018\u2019Consistently the summers are getting hotter, there is less and less rain, and that is a major problem.\u2019\u2019",

      "Richard Bennett said in a report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Wednesday that after seizing power in 2021 the Taliban suspended the 2004 constitution and laws protecting the rights of women and girls. These include a landmark law that criminalized 22 forms of violence against women, including rape and child and forced marriage.",
      "The Taliban dismissed all judges under the previous U.S.-backed government, including approximately 270 women, replacing them with men who share their extreme Islamic views, lack legal training and hand down decisions based on edicts issued by the Taliban, he said.",
      "In addition, he noted that the Taliban have assumed full control over law enforcement and investigative agencies, systematically purging Afghans who worked for the previous government.",
      "Bennett, who was appointed by the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, focused on access to justice and protection for women and girls in his report. He said he held meetings, focus-group discussions and one-on-one interviews with more that 110 Afghans inside and outside the country. He did so remotely because the Taliban have refused to grant him a visa to travel to Afghanistan.",
      "Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, their crackdown on women and girls has been widely reported and globally denounced.",
      "Taliban leaders have barred education for women and girls beyond sixth grade, banned most employment, and prohibited women from many public spaces, including parks, gyms and hairdressers. New laws ban women\u2019s voices and bare faces outside the home.",
      "The Taliban remain isolated from the West because of their restrictions on women and girls and have only been recognized by Russia.",
      "Bennett said the Taliban did not respond to an advance copy of the report and a request for information about their efforts to ensure access to justice and protection for women and girls.",
      "The Taliban defend their approach to justice by claiming they are implementing Islamic sharia law, but Islamic scholars and others have said their interpretation is unparalleled in other Muslim-majority countries and does not adhere to Islamic teachings. They say protecting the legal rights of women is a priority.",
      "Bennett said, however, that women have virtually no rights.",
      "\u201cToday, there are no women judges or prosecutors and no officially registered female lawyers, leaving women and girls with fewer safe channels to report abuse or seek redress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoupled with a lack of female officials in the police and other institutions, the result is widespread underreporting of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\u201d",
      "Bennett said access to justice for girls \u201cis further undermined by the dismantling of key legal safeguards and institutions protecting the rights of children,\u201d including juvenile courts and juvenile rehabilitation centers.",
      "The Taliban requirement that a woman must be accompanied by a male relative also creates barriers to filing complaints and attending court proceedings, he said, and disproportionately affects widows, women who are the heads of their households, the displaced and disabled.",
      "\u201cWomen who engage with the Taliban court system \u2014 whether as victims seeking redress, to resolve family issues, to obtain official documents or as alleged offenders \u2014 face a hostile environment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCourts often reject complaints made by women and are especially reluctant to accept cases relating to divorce, child custody and gender-based violence.\u201d",
      "Facing these obstacles, Bennett said, women increasingly turn to traditional and informal justice mechanisms, including formal jirgas and shuras \u2014 community councils of elders \u2014 and informal mediation by religious leaders, community elders or family. But these are all male-dominated and raise \u201cserious concerns about the rights of women and girls,\u201d he said.",
      "He said international forums offer the best hope for justice. He pointed to the International Criminal Court\u2019s request on Jan. 23 for arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders accused of crimes against humanity for persecution \u201con gender grounds.\u201d And he urged all countries to support efforts to bring Afghanistan before the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s highest tribunal, for violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."

      "An American hiker who hadn't been heard from for six days during a solo backpacking trip on a glacier in Norway has been found, the local Red Cross said Wednesday.",
      "Alec Luhn, 38, a journalist from Wisconsin, didn't make contact with his wife, Veronika, on Monday when he was due to finish a hike in Folgefonna National Park, in the country's southwest.",
      "The Red Cross, which was part of the rescue operation, said Luhn had been found alive near Folgefonna.",
      "\"He was located by helicopter crew and has now been transported for medical treatment,\u201d the organization said on X.",
      "It was not known what condition he was in.",
      "The rescue operation had resumed Wednesday morning after difficult weather hampered the search.",
      "\u201cA large team of volunteers are mobilized, including specialized climbing teams and drones,\u201d the Red Cross said on X less than two hours before it announced that Luhn had been found.",
      "\u201cDifficult terrain, poor visibility, rain and high water levels have complicated access to key areas, but the weather has improved,\u201d the post added.",
      "Norwegian Red Cross spokeswoman Ingeborg Thorsland told NBC News that the organization had deployed 35 volunteers for the search mission.",
      "\u201cYesterday, rescue workers could not pass over some of the bridges because water levels were too high ... and drones could not be deployed at times, due to the limited visibility,\u201d she said.",
      "Luhn, who has worked for multiple media, outlets including CBS, The Telegraph and The Guardian, failed to make contact with his wife Monday, causing her to alert Norwegian authorities. He then missed his flight home that evening to London, where the couple live.",
      "Luhn had last been seen on the afternoon of July 31, Veronika Silchenko told NBC News before he was found.",
      "\u201cI knew that there would be no connection, most probably. So he marked spots of his hike on my map, just in case, and we sort of agreed that he\u2019ll contact me as soon as he had reception,\u201d she said.",
      "Silchenko said Luhn was a very experienced hiker.",
      "\u201cHe hikes all the time. A lot of times we hike together. ... He knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d she said.",
      "He had planned to stay at DNT Holmaskjer and DNT Breidablikk, two mountain cabins, and finish the hike Monday morning but may have changed plans because of the poor weather, she added.",
      "Folgefonna National Park consists of three glaciers and covers 210 square miles, according to the park\u2019s website.",
      "Luhn graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was a foreign correspondent in Moscow for more than 10 years before he turned his attention to climate reporting.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very curious. He has a great love for adventures. He is strong and very resilient,\u201d Silchenko said.",
      "\u201cHe loves the mountains, and he loves the glaciers. That\u2019s why he changed his focus and his career from Russia to climate change and the environment.\u201d",
      "His work has won multiple journalism awards and been nominated for two Emmy awards."

      "LONDON \u2014 British regulators criticized on Wednesday both sides in a dispute over the future of a charity founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, for allowing the issue to be played out in public and damaging the organization\u2019s reputation.",
      "The Charity Commission for England and Wales went on to say that it found no evidence of widespread bullying or misogyny at Sentebale, which provides support for young people living with HIV in Botswana and Lesotho.",
      "The commission opened a review of Sentebale\u2019s governance in April after the two princes stepped down as patrons and a group of trustees, saying the relationship between the board and its chair, Sophie Chandauka, was beyond repair. Chandauka later accused Harry of orchestrating a campaign of bullying and harassment to try to force her out.",
      "Disagreements over the organization\u2019s future surfaced in 2023 after the then-board of trustees sought to roll out a new fundraising strategy in the United States, the commission said. The dispute between Chandauka, other trustees and Harry was first reported to the commission in February 2025.",
      "Those tensions became public in March, when Harry announced he was stepping down as patron to support the trustees who had resigned. In his role as patron, the prince used his star power to promote and raise funds for Sentebale.",
      "\u201cSentebale\u2019s problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity\u2019s reputation, risk overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardizing the charity\u2019s ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve,\u201d commission CEO David Holdsworth said in a statement released Wednesday.",
      "Harry\u2019s spokesman attacked the commission\u2019s decision.",
      "The report \u201cfalls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the fact that the consequences of the current chair\u2019s actions will not be borne by her \u2014 but by the children who rely on Sentebale\u2019s support,\u201d Harry\u2019s spokesman said in a statement.",
      "Harry will now look at alternative ways to help young people in Botswana and Lesotho, the spokesman said.",
      "Chandauka welcomed the report, saying it confirmed the governance issues she raised earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThe unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviors displayed in private,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Harry and Seeiso founded Sentebale in 2006 to honor their late mothers."

      "Predators at a zoo in Denmark could soon be feasting on new donations from the public \u2014 their pets.",
      "Aalborg Zoo, which sits on the outskirts of the city of the same name in the Scandinavian country\u2019s northwest, put out a call Thursday for unwanted animals on its social media channels.",
      "Donated pets will be \u201cgently euthanized\u201d by trained staff and then used as \u201cfodder\u201d to take care of the well-being of predators, it said, alongside a photo showing a lynx baring its teeth.",
      "Chicken, rabbits and guinea pigs would be welcome as food for its meat-eaters, the post said.",
      "The post echoed a similar appeal that appeared on the zoo's website earlier this year, which also called for horses to be donated so long as they were no taller than 4 feet 10 inches, healthy and not treated for illness in the past 30 days.",
      "Horse owners can obtain a tax deduction for the value of the animal, it said.",
      "Zoos have a \u201cresponsibility to imitate the natural food chain\u201d for carnivores that need whole prey for a hunting experience similar to that in the wild, the post said.",
      "\u201cIf you have a healthy animal that has to leave here for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,\u201d it added. \u201cWe ensure natural behavior, nutrition and well-being of our predators.\u201d",
      "The post quickly sparked online debate drawing criticism from some quarters.",
      "\u201cThe idea that a zoo, of all places, is encouraging people to drop off their animals to be killed and fed to lions and tigers is, to me, incredibly disturbing,\u201d one user wrote on Facebook.",
      "Aalborg Zoo has been feeding its carnivores smaller livestock for many years, deputy director Pia Nielsen said, \u201cto give them as natural a diet as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cTherefore, it makes sense to allow animals that need to be euthanized for various reasons to be of use in this way,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIn Denmark, this practice is common, and many of our guests and partners appreciate the opportunity to contribute.\u201d",
      "In an update to its original post Tuesday, the zoo said it had closed the comments section.",
      "\u201cWe understand that the post arouses emotions and interest, but hateful and malicious rhetoric is not necessary \u2014 and we encourage everyone to maintain a respectful tone,\u201d the zoo wrote.",
      "It is not unheard of for animals to be fed to predators after they have died in a zoo or culled from healthy animal populations.",
      "In 2014, Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark's capital courted controversy when it killed an 18-month-old giraffe called Marius with a bolt gun and fed him to the lions, saying the animal was \u201cunwanted.\u201d",
      "An online petition with thousands of signatures failed to save him and the zoo said at the time that Marius had been euthanized to avoid inbreeding."

      "BRUSSELS \u2014 NATO has started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($578 million).",
      "Sweden also announced Tuesday it would contribute $275 million to a joint effort along with its Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway to provide $500 million worth of air defenses, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and spare parts.",
      "Two deliveries of equipment, most of it bought in the United States, are expected this month, although the Nordic package is expected to arrive in September. The equipment is supplied based on Ukraine\u2019s priority needs on the battlefield. NATO allies then locate the weapons and ammunition and send them on.",
      "\u201cPackages will be prepared rapidly and issued on a regular basis,\u201d NATO said Monday.",
      "Air defense systems are in greatest need. The United Nations has said that Russia\u2019s relentless pounding of urban areas behind the front line has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians.",
      "Russia\u2019s bigger army is also making slow but costly progress along the 620-mile front line. Currently, it is waging an operation to take the eastern city of Pokrovsk, a logistical hub whose fall could allow it to drive deeper into Ukraine.",
      "European allies and Canada are buying most of the equipment they plan to send from the United States, which has greater stocks of ready military materiel, as well as more effective weapons. The Trump administration is not giving any arms to Ukraine.",
      "The new deliveries will come on top of other pledges of military equipment.",
      "The Kiel Institute, which tracks support to Ukraine, estimates that as of June, European countries had provided 72 billion euros ($83 billion) worth of military aid since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, compared to $65 billion in U.S. aid.",
      "Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said that \u201cAmerican air defense systems and munitions, in particular, are crucial for Ukraine to defend itself.\u201d Announcing the deliveries Monday, he said Russia\u2019s attacks are \u201cpure terror, intended to break Ukraine.\u201d",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the Netherlands, posting on social media that \u201cUkraine, and thus the whole of Europe, will be better protected from Russian terror.\u201d",
      "He said the deliveries are coming \u201cat a time when Russia is trying to scale up its strikes. This will definitely help protect the lives of our people!\u201d",
      "Germany said Friday it will deliver two more Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine in the coming days. It agreed to the move after securing assurances that the U.S. will prioritize the delivery of new Patriots to Germany to backfill its stocks. These weapon systems are only made in the U.S.",
      "As an organization, NATO provides only non-lethal assistance to Ukraine like uniforms, tents, medical supplies and logistics support. The 32-nation military alliance has mostly sought to protect NATO territory from possible Russian attack and avoid being dragged into a war against a nuclear power.",
      "But its support role has expanded since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, even as his administration insists European allies must now take care of their own security and that of their war-ravaged neighbor. Trump has made no public promise of weapons or economic support for Ukraine.",
      "Trump said on July 28 that the U.S. is \u201cgoing to be sending now military equipment and other equipment to NATO, and they\u2019ll be doing what they want, but I guess it\u2019s for the most part working with Ukraine.\u201d"
