      "The Los Angeles County district attorney says his office will not file sexual assault charges against movie producer David Guillod",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday that his office will not file sexual assault charges against movie producer David Guillod, more than four years after his arrest.",
      "District Attorney Nathan Hochman said in a statement that there was insufficient evidence to prove a case against Guillod beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "The announcement came nearly three years after a judge rejected similar charges against Guillod in Santa Barbara County.",
      "An email seeking comment from an attorney who has represented Guillod was not immediately answered. Guillod has denied all of the allegations.",
      "Guillod, a talent manager and producer whose credits include 2017's \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d and 2020's \u201cExtraction,\u201d was originally arrested in 2020 and charged with rape and sexual assault involving six women between 2014 and 2020 in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. Authorities chose to try the cases jointly in Santa Barbara County, where a judge at a 2022 preliminary hearing found that there was insufficient evidence for Guillod to go to trial on charges involving four of the women.",
      "The judge found there was enough evidence to go forward with charges that he had assaulted an actor in 2012 and a waitress in 2018, but because those were both in LA County, Santa Barbara prosecutors no longer had jurisdiction and sent the cases to the Los Angeles District Attorney.",
      "\u201cThe allegations involve deeply troubling and concerning behavior, and we empathize with the pain and trauma the accusers have experienced throughout this long investigative process,\u201d Hochman's statement said.",
      "Hochman's office also recently declined to file charges against Marilyn Manson after another yearslong investigation.",
      "Guillod had been among the people investigated by a task force formed by former District Attorney Jackie Lacey in 2017 to investigate sexual misconduct in Hollywood when the #MeToo movement gained national attention. The vast majority of cases they considered did not lead to charges.",
      "An exception was movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape and sexual assault in Los Angeles in 2022. He is appealing the convictions.",

      "HOUSTON -- Dallas rapper Yella Beezy has been arrested and charged with capital murder in the shooting death of fellow rapper Mo3 on a busy interstate in 2020, according to court records.",
      "Yella Beezy, 33, whose real name is Markies Conway, was indicted by a Dallas County grand jury on Tuesday on a charge of capital murder while remuneration. The indictment accuses Conway of hiring a man named Kewon White to murder Mo3, whose real name was Melvin Noble.",
      "The indictment did not provide information on why authorities believe Conway hired White to shoot Noble, who also lived in Dallas.",
      "Court records did not list an attorney who could speak on behalf of Conway. Calls and emails to representatives for Conway were not immediately returned.",
      "In a Facebook post after Conway's arrest, Noble's mother, Nichole Williams Noble wrote, \u201cJustice for my baby!!!!\u201d",
      "The 28-year-old Noble was driving on Interstate 35 in south Dallas on Nov. 11, 2020, when authorities allege White drove up next to him and got out of his vehicle with a gun in his hand. Noble got out of his vehicle and began running south on the freeway as White shot at him, authorities said. Noble and a bystander who was inside a car were shot by White, police said. The bystander survived but Noble died at a hospital.",
      "White and another man, Devin Brown, 32, were later indicted in Noble\u2019s death. Their cases related to Noble\u2019s death remain pending. White, 26, was sentenced in 2022 in a separate case to nearly nine years in federal prison after pleading guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.",
      "Conway is best known for his 2017 single, \u201cThat\u2019s On Me\u201d and the 2019 song \u201cBacc At It Again\u201d with Quavo and Gucci Mane.",
      "In October 2018, Conway survived being shot while driving on a tollway in the Dallas suburb of Lewisville when someone pulled up next to him and opened fire, hitting him three times.",
      "Noble had more than 800,000 followers on his Instagram page and was best known for a 2019 remix of the song \u201cErrybody,\u201d with Baton Rouge, Louisiana, rapper Boosie Badazz.",

      "NEW YORK -- The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.",
      "\u201cI was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,\" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. \"I just feel like we\u2019ve seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Face,\u201d which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.",
      "Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.",
      "Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, \u201cHappy Face\u201d is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It\u2019s either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it\u2019s all about kicking in doors. I\u2019ve written on those shows and they\u2019re fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,\u201d Cacicio says.",
      "\u201cWhat is it like for the rest of the family when there\u2019s this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?\u201d",
      "Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cThe worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you\u2019re a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?\u201d",
      "Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, \u201cShattered Silence\u201d and the 2018 \"Happy Face\" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.",
      "Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: \u201cIf you want someone who\u2019s a straight-up journalist, who\u2019s just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,\u201d she told her. \u201cThere\u2019s also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that\u2019s asking some questions about true crime.\u201d",
      "Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives \u2014 Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.",
      "\u201cObviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn\u2019t talk about and it was something I didn\u2019t want my friends to know,\u201d says Cacicio.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that\u2019s what made her trust me \u2014 that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also \u201cHappy Face\u201d isn't that kind of show.",
      "\u201cThis is told from Melissa\u2019s point of view, and I think it\u2019s actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he shows emotions like a little boy who\u2019s trying to talk himself out of a whipping.\u201d",
      "Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.",
      "\u201cAre we obsessed with these stories because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?\u201d she asks. \u201cI read somewhere that it\u2019s an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re watching is worse than what\u2019s happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.\u201d",

      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \u201cdisappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \u201c'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\u201d",
      "They said there was an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \u201cmade no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\u201d",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d \u2014 with the always-welcome addition of Mavis Staples \u2014 is a horn-and-slide-guitar slice of bluesy, wailing rock that's also a celebration of a band that has endured changes and re-formed with members now in their 70s.",
      "\u201cSomehow, here we are,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends throughout the years. Our kids have all grown up together and our kids have kind of kept us in contact even at times when we might have dropped off the radar for each other.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is a snapshot in time of where the band is and where the writers are,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe didn\u2019t consciously sit down and say, 'Well, we\u2019re going to try and do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "One track, \"Learn to Let Go,\" is an unrequited love song that's about letting go of things that hold you back, while \u201cSpeed of Pain\u201d is about how the worst things in life can become the best.",

      "Even the most devoted fans would have to acknowledge that these have not been the most illustrious illustrations of Disney magic. At their best (\u201cPete\u2019s Dragon\u201d? \u201cCinderella\u201d?) they breathe life into old classics that could use a little updating. At their worst, well, blue Will Smith.",
      "Given the rapacious rate of remakes in modern Hollywood, it\u2019s remarkable that it\u2019s taken nearly 90 years for Disney to return to \u201cSnow White.\u201d It means going back to the very foundation of the Mouse House. The 1937 \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was Disney\u2019s first animated feature; its grosses paid for the studio\u2019s Burbank lot.",
      "That legacy of \u201cSnow White,\u201d by comparison, doesn\u2019t do any favors to Marc Webb\u2019s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this \u201cSnow White\u201d: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of \u201cfair\u201d beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time.",
      "It wouldn\u2019t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past \u2014 a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic.",
      "But it\u2019s a tricky thing reworking a fable that\u2019s been around two centuries, and that\u2019s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel's war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there\u2019s a reason \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d has been stripped from the title) and the alleged \u201cwoke\u201d-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate.",
      "Despite some gloriously lush production design, \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 innocent of most of those backlashes though not all \u2014 can\u2019t quite thread the needle. Even the new songs (by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) that are good (\"Waiting on a Wish\") struggle to fit in alongside old standbys. Zegler does a spirited job remaking a classic Disney princess into a more modern woman; when she sings, the movie gets a lift. The last thing that's wrong with this \u201cSnow White\u201d is Zegler's casting.",
      "But like scaffolding that's been left up too long, the strain of renovation shows in Webb\u2019s film, particularly in its awkward handling of Dopey, Sneezy and company. The seven dwarfs, like the fawns and squirrels, are rendered in CGI. You could argue that this acknowledges the artificiality of a dated and offensive trope. But it also gives \u201cSnow White\u201d an uncanny quality, with all human characters but the dwarfs being played by real people. As if to Band-Aid over this, one of the woodsmen is played by an actor of short stature (George Appleby) whose presence seems like yet another atonement, only one for this \u201cSnow White,\u201d not 1937\u2019s.",
      "You might be thinking: But what about the movie? The problem with \u201cSnow White\u201d is that you never stop thinking about these much-strategized and sometimes superficial efforts to recontextualize the original movie. Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay remakes Snow White's story as less a princess awaiting her Prince Charming (the song \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come\" has been jettisoned) than an heir to a throne who loses her gumption. Though taught as a child to be \u201cfair\u201d as a leader by her father king (Hadley Fraser), Snow White has lost any ambition by the time Gadot's Evil Queen takes over the kingdom.",
      "Gadot sinks her teeth into the Evil Queen, a spikey, slinky villain who moves with a metallic rustle (the costumes are by Sandy Powell). But she feels cut off from the movie, without the lines that would elevate her flamboyant performance into something memorable. The prince has been altogether scrubbed; instead Andrew Burnap plays the blandly cocksure bandit Jonathan who encourages Snow White not to wait for her father's rescue.",
      "Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 mortal or CGI \u2014 is as stiff as could be. You're left glumly scorekeeping the updates \u2014 one win here, a loss there \u2014 while pondering why, regardless of the final tally, recapturing the magic of long ago is so elusive.",
      "\u201cSnow White,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. Running time: 109 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d is how bestselling thriller writer Paula Hawkins describes the debut novel, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d from Hannah Deitch",
      "When bestselling psychological thriller writer Paula Hawkins (\u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d 2015) stamps the cover of your debut novel with \u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d your career is off to a fast start.",
      "The same goes for the plot pace of Hannah Deitch\u2019s book, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d which opens at a breakneck clip and doesn\u2019t really slow down for about 200 pages. Evie Gordon is our narrator. She went to \u201ca liberal arts school, stupidly expensive,\u201d and is now working as an SAT tutor in pricey California zip codes. Her first sentence is a gem: \u201cI was once a famous murderess.\u201d The rest of the book reveals how she earned that appellation and the adverb \u201conce.\u201d",
      "The opening scene is at \u201cThe Victor House,\u201d which Evie describes in great detail \u2014 its \u201clive-edge table cut from Portuguese wood,\u201d the \u201cDe Gournay hand-painted silk wallpaper,\u201d and the \u201caquamarine Moroccan tile in the bathroom.\u201d It\u2019s where Evie discovers the dead bodies of Dinah and Peter Victor, the mother with her face bashed in and the father floating in a koi pond. As Evie flees, she hears a voice crying out for help and rescues a woman trapped behind a door under a staircase, before coming face-to-face with her tutoring student, Serena. Thinking Evie and her accomplice are killers fleeing the scene of their crime, Serena attacks with a lamp and the scene ends with Evie smashing a vase against Serena\u2019s head before escaping with the mystery woman in Evie\u2019s car.",
      "Cue the Hans Zimmer soundtrack for the next 100+ pages as Evie gets to know her partner in crime, who doesn\u2019t speak at first, traumatized by whatever happened to her in the house. Eventually we learn her name, Jae, and together they pull off a series of crimes, some petty (shoplifting, carjacking), some not (assaulting and shooting at a few men and boys who recognize them from TV). Throughout it all, Evie\u2019s inner monologue keeps readers engaged as she ponders things like how the language of courtship (Chase. Pursue. Stalk.) mirrors the language of hunting. It\u2019s clear after a while that Evie and Jae lust for one another and when that dam finally breaks, the novel takes on a torrid tone that feels authentic for two people on the run for weeks relying on only each other and their animal instincts to survive.",
      "Of course, Paula Hawkins doesn\u2019t blurb your book unless there\u2019s a well-earned twist, and \u201cKiller Potential\u201d delivers on that front. The final third or so of the novel is a real joy to read as Deitch fills in all the blanks using different narrative techniques. Saying anything more would spoil the fun, but \u201cKiller Potential\u201d earns Deitch a spot on the \u201cnew novelists to watch\u201d list.",

      "Jonathan Majors plays an amateur bodybuilder in the dark drama \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s rage simmering inside Killian Maddox, the amateur bodybuilder portrayed by Jonathan Majors at the heart of the dark and stylized film \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a kind of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for the incel age, a harrowing portrait of untreated mental illness, violence, false idols, steroids and male loneliness. There was, from the beginning, lots to discuss and debate in the fabric of \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d But in the two years since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, it was also eclipsed by the very real-life travails of its star, who was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend.",
      "In January 2023, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d had an exciting future with Oscar hopes for Majors. Searchlight Pictures won the distribution rights, reportedly over the likes of Neon and Sony Pictures Classics. And Majors was skyrocketing to the top, with big roles in \u201cCreed III\u201d and as Marvel\u2019s new main villain, Kang. But two months later, he was arrested. By that December, Majors was found guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation and fired by Marvel. A month later, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d was without distribution. Majors has, throughout it all, maintained his innocence.",
      "The film was eventually picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment, the same distributor who jumped in to release the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d after the rest of the entertainment business shied away from it. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d went on to get Oscar nominations for its two stars.",
      "But there\u2019s a different kind of stigma around \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which is why this review has also been a bit eclipsed by what's happened in Majors' life. It\u2019s a film about a man teetering on the edge of violence, about the relentless pursuit of greatness \u2014 and it is deeply uncomfortable watching his descent.",
      "His simplistic devotion to one wild goal may be his undoing in a world that just doesn\u2019t care about him. This is not the movie that any public relations professional would choose as a \u201ccomeback role.\u201d Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny the monumental ferocity of Majors\u2019 performance, from his full transformation to his unsettling ability to show the pain behind (most of) the psychotic actions.",
      "Killian\u2019s life is nothing glamorous: He works in a grocery store and at home cares for his aging grandfather. But he has an intense, maniacal need to be seen and to be remembered. And the only way he\u2019s figured out how to achieve that is through physical perfection \u2014 or at least his very narrow idea. Success is a magazine cover, which he naively conflates with immortality.",
      "When co-worker Jessie (Haley Bennett, who does a lot with a small, somewhat thankless role) agrees to go out on a date with him, he is genuinely shocked that she isn\u2019t familiar with his bodybuilding idol, saying something to the effect of \u201cyou need to get out more.\u201d",
      "Writer-director Elijah Bynum effectively imbues his film with stylized intensity. You feel uneasy and captivated from the start, though you try to give Killian the benefit of the doubt \u2014 to look for his goodness, to root for his success, if only for the hope that it might keep him docile for a little longer. Though we\u2019re told early that he\u2019s had violent episodes, through his court-ordered therapist, the glass isn\u2019t fully shattered until Jessie starts to process that Killian is someone she needs to get away from, fast. This is notably after he orders perhaps $500 worth of protein on the date, just for himself. Sadly, we don\u2019t get to see the bill.",
      "While \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d is an interesting character study, one many actors would love to play for all its dramatic opportunities, it also seems crafted entirely to provoke and shock \u2014 especially in the almost unbearably bleak final hour. After two viewings, one of which I had to take a break from during one of his violent outbursts, I\u2019m not actually sure what it\u2019s trying to say about men, about trauma, about 'roid rage. Killian seems less like an authentic person and more a simplistic stand-in for the forgotten person, the quiet weirdo who ends up a mass killer.",
      "And yet as movies are being accused of being too straightforward, too moralistic, too simple, perhaps some ambiguity, some discomfort, some unresolved unpleasantness is overdue. Majors is a force, and Bynum is certainly a director to watch. The question with \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which was the same in January 2023 as it is in March 2025 is: Will anyone?",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cviolent content, drug use, sexual material, nudity and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "As CBS' parent company considers settlement of President Donald Trump's lawsuit against \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America\u2019s storied newsmagazine is pulling no punches in its coverage of the new administration",
      "NEW YORK -- As CBS corporate leaders ponder settling President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against the network's \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America's storied newsmagazine has produced some fast and hard-hitting stories critical of the new administration in every episode since Trump was inaugurated.",
      "The latest was Sunday, when CBS News helped pay for a performance featuring non-white middle and high school musicians who had won a contest and with it, the right to play with the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The original concert, however, was canceled because of Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Correspondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show's seven stories since Trump's inauguration, including Sunday's. He examined the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested \u201clong prison sentences\u201d for those working on the show.",
      "All came at a time when television's most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.",
      "\u201cThis may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,\u201d said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.",
      "Pelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.",
      "\u201cAnother week, another \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story trying to discredit Trump policies,\u201d Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X on Sunday night.",
      "Trump's lawsuit, coupled with a parallel Federal Communications Commission investigation, accuses \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of election interference for the way it edited Bill Whitaker's interview last fall with Trump's 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "Two sound bites, broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d depicted Harris giving different responses to Whitaker in a discussion about Israel. CBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.",
      "CBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay $16 million in December to end Trump's lawsuit against ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. Complicating matters is Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration.",
      "Many at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did nothing wrong. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologize as part of any prospective settlement.",
      "\u201cMy precious \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. \u201cI am so proud of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.\u201d",
      "Neither Owens nor Pelley would comment on whether the show is trying to deliver any sort of message about the lawsuit through its work. Bettag said he believed \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is motivated by the importance of the stories.",
      "What the show has done during the past two months is striking, said Bettag, now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe \u201860 Minutes\u2019 people are such committed journalists that they\u2019d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\"",
      "Some of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce. Pelley's March 2 report about Ukraine came only days after the White House confrontation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk's angry comment on his X social media platform came after Pelley's Feb. 16 story about the billionaire's role in the quick shutdown of the USAID office. \u201cThe world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families,\u201d Pelley said, noting that Musk collects \u201cbillions of taxpayer dollars\u201d for his SpaceX company.",
      "Hours later, Musk wrote on X: \u201c60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.\u201d",
      "Other news organizations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. Besides Pelley, he cited the news staff of the Washington Post at a time the newspaper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos, has shown more friendliness to Trump.",
      "Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story involved some elite high school students \u2014 each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent \u2014 who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.",
      "CBS worked with Equity Arc, an organization devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organize a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.",
      "Pelley called it the \u201cconcert that was not meant to be heard.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,\u201d he said. \u201cHere tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.\u201d",
      "Pelley's March 9 report, \u201cFiring the Watchdogs,\u201d was about Trump's efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies. He quoted Trump as saying the firings were standard for a new administration taking office. \u201cHe's wrong,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "His story about the U.S. Justice Department examined the resistance among some prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\u201cAs he continues to step up his attacks on President Donald Trump and the new administration, Pelley is elbowing aside all others to emerge as Trump's loudest TV critic,\u201d wrote Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner.",
      "In his stories, Pelley's deadpan voice and methodical style could not hide the sharpness of some observations. While narrating the story about USAID, Pelley noted that \u201cIt's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert De Niro's doing double duty in \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d literally",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the actor!\u201d shouts Anna Genovese at her estranged spouse, gangster Vito Genovese, in a courtroom where he\u2019s implausibly claiming he lacks funds to support her. \u201cThe best actor in the world! Better than Clark Gable!\u201d",
      "And we all chuckle. They probably all chuckled on set, too. Because the man playing Vito in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is none other than Robert De Niro, indeed one of the best actors in the world, revered in our time as Gable was in his.",
      "It\u2019s a cute moment and an apt one, too, because Barry Levinson\u2019s film, which aims but fails to channel the magic of decades-old mob movies like \u201cGoodfellas\u201d \u2014 though penned by the same writer, Nicholas Pileggi \u2014 is all about De Niro. Actually, it\u2019s all about De Niro AND De Niro. The man plays both lead roles, feuding mobsters Genovese and Frank Costello, in a story based on real events.",
      "Is it a gimmick? Surely. Does it work? Well, there\u2019s the entertainment value \u2014 this is De Niro, after all \u2014 and if you feel that more De Niro minutes are always better, then it follows that two roles are better than one. Others may feel it has a mob-themed \u201cParent Trap\u201d vibe, less weighty than it should be given the obviously violent subject matter.",
      "Also, \u201cGoodfellas\u201d fans may wonder if the Vito role was once intended for Joe Pesci (the movie\u2019s been in development forever), so similar is the character to that actor\u2019s impulsive, manically suspicious persona. On the other hand, in two brief scenes where the De Niros appear together for momentous meetings, one might be forgiven for wondering if Al Pacino was in line at some point, for a \u201cHeat\u201d-like moment.",
      "Happily, De Niro relies here on makeup, and not de-aging as in \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d though it must be said that, at times, his two characters just don\u2019t look different enough. More importantly, \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d despite its pedigree, doesn't rise anywhere near the heights of its glorious predecessors. It is, rather, an enjoyable if choppily paced look at a relationship between two men, where unfortunately we\u2019re arriving pretty late in the game.",
      "There are, though, a few crackling surprises: that domestic courtroom scene; a tense, televised Senate committee grilling; and finally a climactic gathering of mob bosses in the countryside, with fabulous period vehicles parked on the lawn and sausages on the grill, that's disrupted in comically sudden fashion.",
      "We begin in 1957 in Manhattan. Costello, after a night partying respectably with high society, stops at his swank apartment building. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you,\u201d declares the nervous man who shoots him in the head in his lobby.",
      "The shooter (Cosmo Jarvis), sent by Genovese, makes a bad mistake, as his boss will remind him later: \u201cYou gotta go SEE if they\u2019re dead!\u201d Amazingly, Costello survives. \u201cI shoulda been paying more attention,\u201d says the genteel mobster who favors diplomacy over bloodletting, narrating from the future.",
      "We then go back in time to figure out how things got this bad.",
      "With the help of vintage photos and footage artfully edited to include actors playing the younger Frank and Vito, we learn the two were good friends as young Italian immigrants on the streets. But when Vito got mixed up in a murder case, he had to flee to Italy \u2014 leaving cooler-headed Frank in charge of the business.",
      "Years later, Vito returns, and wants his role at the top of the mob family. And so things go south, quickly.",
      "The women in their lives mirror the differences between the two men. Costello\u2019s wife of more than 50 years, Bobbie (Debra Messing, making a nice foray into drama), is a loyal partner who urges her husband to retire and leave New York \u2014 along with their adorable dogs (De Niro\u2019s own pooches, dressed in mink coats and hats \u2014 a costume design Oscar for this canine fashion, please!). Genovese\u2019s wife Anna (Kathrine Narducci, excellent) is a businesswoman \u2014 she owns a gay bar \u2014 whose fiery union with Vito turns disastrous.",
      "A mere glance at Wikipedia will tell you that both Genovese and Costello ultimately died in nonviolent ways. There\u2019s plenty in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d that you won\u2019t see there \u2014 for example, the movie's version of just who engineered that farmland mob summit, and why.",
      "But watching dozens of mobsters run like heck when police happen upon their gathering is a hoot, and it\u2019s hard to beat the moment when two of them insist to suspicious cops: \u201cWe\u2019re hunters!\u201d",
      "If only such witty moments were more frequent in a two-hour movie that somehow, alas, feels much longer.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d a Warner Bros. Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violence and pervasive language.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "Both took a dip -- but only a dip.",
      "With JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers and a host of other standout players leading the way, attendance across the country was just short of last season's record numbers in women's hoops and still the second-highest ever.",
      "More networks showed more games on TV this season and ratings were strong heading into March Madness that starts this week. ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",
      "\u201cThere are great stars, great brands, we\u2019ve done more than we have done before and we\u2019re not alone in doing that,\u201d Fox Sports President of Insights and Analytics Mike Mulvihill said. \u201cThe 3-5-10 year trend clearly is an upward trend.\u201d",
      "While the network\u2019s overall ratings are down from last season\u2019s record mark that was due in large part to Clark being on Fox a lot, Mulvihill is happy with where they are.",
      "\u201cTo go from zero exposures a few years ago to 18 on our biggest platform speaks to the growth and interest in the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s growing confidence in this building that we can put it on broadcast and justify it. I love that we are able to put games on in primetime. It means something to the coaches and players.\u201d",
      "Having great matchups helps. The game between Watkins\u2019 USC and Bueckers\u2019 UConn on Dec. 21 was shown in primetime after an NFL game and averaged 2.2 million viewers, peaking at nearly 3.8 million.

      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",
      "Women's basketball programming director Dan Margulis knows that the network had a perfect storm last season to achieve the record ratings that saw the women's championship game outdraw the men. Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at early rounds and everything growing going into it,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cCompared to two years ago, we see that growth.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just the championship game that drew huge numbers. A rematch between Reese and Clark in the Elite Eight game was massive as well.",
      "\u201cCertainly the floor has risen dramatically,\u201d said lead ESPN announcer Rebecca Lobo. \u201cThe expectation for this year\u2019s tournament, Final Four or national championship shouldn\u2019t be what we saw a year ago. Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",
      "While there isn't an undefeated team this year or a generational player like Clark on her last run, there is more parity in the sport.",
      "People aren\u2019t just watching on TV, but also showing up at games. The power conferences had strong attendance marks. The SEC led the way, setting numerous conference records, including total for its tournament and the mark in both the semis and the finals.",
      "The Big Ten had its second-highest average attendance in the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cGranted we get to see some of the best ones, but the energy was different throughout the country,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cThe South Carolina-LSU game on a Thursday night with 2,500 students has a different energy. The increase from students across the country has made for incredible environments.\u201d",

      "The trade organization that represents movie theater owners in the U.S. and abroad is getting a rebrand",
      "In hindsight, NATO was an unnecessarily confusing acronym for a trade organization representing movie theater owners. For 60 years, the National Association of Theatre Owners has promoted interests of movie theaters, from the biggest chains to the one screen mom and pop shops. They\u2019ve also regularly gotten mail and phone calls intended for the other NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
      "But the theater owner\u2019s organization is looking to the future, with a new name and a refocused mission. The group will now be known as Cinema United, president and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary told The Associated Press Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little complicated having the same name as a multinational military alliance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe felt that it was time to look at our name and do a rebrand.\u201d",
      "They wanted the new name to reflect the \u201cpassion and energy of the people that run theaters,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, and to put the focus back on the exhibitors and movie theaters. Cinema United represents more than 32,000\u202fmovie screens in the U.S. and more than 30,000 screens in 88 countries. Their job, O\u2019Leary explained, is to promote and support theatrical exhibition. Moviegoing, the new tagline reads, is their mission.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a challenging four or five years. But with each passing day, we put those challenges in the rearview mirror a little bit more. Our focus right now is on the future,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think that we stand on the precipice of the next great era of cinema.\u201d",
      "Just a few weeks ago, \u201cAnora\u201d filmmaker Sean Baker made his own case for theaters on the national stage. In accepting his best director Oscar, he used his time at the podium to make a \u201cbattle cry\u201d for the theatrical experience \u2013 for filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screen and for studios to keep releasing them there.",
      "\u201cPeople were ecstatic about it,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHe has earned the unyielding allegiance of theater owners all around the world for his strong support over the years, and certainly at the Oscars.\u201d",
      "Movie theaters big and small were hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 many closed and never re-opened. Last year, they also faced a depleted release calendar due to the Hollywood strikes. It\u2019s all resulted in a depleted domestic box office that has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. In 2024, the industry finished just over $8.7 billion, down 3.3% from 2023 and 23.5% from 2019.",
      "A fuller release schedule is expected this year, but currently the box-office total is down about 5% from where the industry was last year at this time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we not put too much emphasis on a single year like 2025. We need to constantly be building and growing and moving forward,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Despite challenges, it remains an all-ages and affordable entertainment pasttime. A recent study from the National Research Group said 76% of the American population ages 12 to 74 attended at least one movie in 2024.",
      "And though theater closures often make headlines, like the E Street Cinema in Washington D.C., where Cinema United is headquartered, there\u2019s also been a spate of investment and refurbishment in theaters around the country, some spearheaded by famous filmmakers and actors.",
      "Jason Reitman along with more than 30 directors including Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and Bradley Cooper last February acquired Westwood\u2019s Village Theater in Los Angeles, which dates back to 1931. Patrick Wilson also purchased and helped restore an historic theater in New Canaan, CT, joining big screen disciples like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino who have all invested in movie theaters.",
      "Last fall, the eight biggest theater chains in the U.S. and Canada announced that they planned to invest more than $2.2 billion to modernize 21,000 movie theater screens over the next three years. This includes anything from projectors, lighting and sound to features in the concessions area. But upgrades in theaters are nothing new, O\u2019Leary said, they\u2019re just helping to draw attention to it.",
      "\u201cThe entire membership reinvests in their theaters on a regular basis,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cPart of the reason we made that announcement was because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious to people that theater owners are constantly in the process of reinventing themselves and reinvesting.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes just over a week before some 6,000 movie theater employees from around the world convene in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon conference, which Cinema United hosts.",
      "All the major Hollywood studios, including The Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures and even Amazon/MGM will be making big, starry presentations on the main stage at Caesar\u2019s Palace \u2014 where executives and stars will show off new footage and trailers to make the case that they have the goods to get audiences in the theaters.",
      "NATO was coined in 1965, a merger of the nation\u2019s largest movie theater trade organizations: The Theater Owners of America, itself a product of a merger dating back to 1948, and the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors, which goes back to the 1920s.",
      "Those at Cinema United like to say that \"we\u2019re not a Hollywood industry. We\u2019re a Main Street industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the vast majority of our members are small businesses, so they feel the same pushes and pulls that other small businesses feel throughout the United States and around the world, O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe headquarters of our biggest members are not in Los Angeles or New York. They\u2019re in Knoxville, Dallas and Kansas.\"",

In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

      "Her family and agent told the news agency Agence France-Presse that Dequenne died Sunday of a rare cancer in a hospital outside of Paris. In 2023, Dequenne revealed she had been diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. Representatives for Dequenne did not immediately respond to inquires from The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In \u201cRosetta,\u201d from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d\u2019Or that year.",
      "Born in Bel\u0153il, Belgium, in 1981, Dequenne had a performance streak from a young age. She studied drama at the Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Baudour.",

      "Decades of road salt use is taking a toll on New York City\u2019s water reservoirs",
      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

Musicians adapted the guitar to emulate the sounds of traditional string instruments like the kora. Local artists such as Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 have fused Malian melodies with elements of the blues, creating a soulful, hypnotic sound that has gained international acclaim.",
      "Iconic Malian musical duo Amadou and Mariam awakened Ndiaye's passion for the instrument when he was a boy.",
      "\u201cOne day, near a photography studio, I heard their music resonating through the window, which pushed me to discover this universe,\u201d he said.",
      "Known as \u201cthe blind couple from Mali,\" the duo of Amadou Bagayoko, who lost his vision at age 16, and Mariam Doumbia, who became blind at age 5 as a consequence of untreated measles, rose to international fame in the 1990s with their fusion of traditional Malian music, rock, and blues.",
      "The couple met at Mali's institute for the blind, where Doumbia was studying braille and teaching classes in dance and music.",
      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",
      "Dicko is also blind. Using a special typewriter, he can create texts in braille for his students. But he says his students are still at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cWe have a crisis of teaching materials,\u201d Dicko said. He has one reading book in braille for his entire class of dozens of students.",
      "But with the development of new technologies, some blind and partially sighted people hope that educational barriers will continue to fall.",
      "\u201cThere is software, there are telephones that speak, so there are many things that are vocal,\u201d said Bagayoko of the musical duo. \u201cThis allows us to move forward.\u201d",
      "But Moussa Mbengue, the Senegal-based program officer for inclusive education at Sightsavers, said such advances still don't make the leap that braille did two centuries ago.",
      "\"It cannot replace braille. On the contrary, for me, technology complements braille,\u201d he said.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A jury found the alleged ringleader of a massive pandemic fraud case in Minnesota guilty on all counts Wednesday for her role in a scheme that federal prosecutors say stole $250 million from a program meant to feed children in need.",
      "Aimee Bock \u2014 founder of Feeding our Future, the group at the heart of the plot \u2014 was one of 70 defendants charged in the overall case, which prosecutors said was the nation's single largest fraud scheme against COVID-19 relief programs.",
      "The Minnesota case has also drawn attention for an attempt to bribe a juror in an earlier trial and witness tampering in Bock's trial, which began last month. Thirty-seven defendants have already pleaded guilty, while five were convicted in a group of defendants who were tried last year.",
      "The jury also convicted a co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, owner of the now-defunct Safari Restaurant in Minneapolis.",
      "Bock, 44, and Said, 36, were charged with multiple counts involving conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery. Said was also charged with money laundering. Bock allegedly pocketed nearly $2 million, while Said was accused of taking around $5 million. They both maintained their innocence and testified at trial.",
      "U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel ordered them both held without bail pending their sentencing, for which she did not set a date.",
      "\u201cIt was the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and what Bock and and her co-defendants did was reprehensible.\u201d Lisa Kirkpatrick the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said at a news conference afterward.",
      "\u201cDuring COVID, while so many were trying to be helpers, Bock and Said were thieves,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey used a time of crisis as their golden opportunity to enrich themselves and their criminal partners \u2014 outlandishly so. At every step of the way, Bock fought to keep her fraud scheme going. Today her efforts to lie, to blame others, to escape responsibility, all came to an end.\u201d",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, said there will be an appeal. While he has not decided what legal grounds might be used as its basis, he told The Associated Press that the jury could not have fairly considered all six weeks' worth of evidence in the few hours they deliberated after getting the case Wednesday morning.",
      "But lead prosecutor Joe Thompson called the scheme \u201cbrazen and corrupt\u201d and told reporters it tarnished Minnesota's reputation for good governance and civic mindedness as well as its high quality of life and low crime.",
      "\u201cThe Feeding Our Future case has come to symbolize the problem of fraud in our state,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt has become the shame of Minnesota. Hopefully today\u2019s verdict will help turn the page in this awful chapter in our state\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who came under heavy criticism from Republicans who said his administration should have caught the fraud earlier, told reporters he remains \u201cfurious\u201d with \u201ccriminals that preyed on the system that was meant to feed children.\u201d But he pointed out that nobody in state government, which administered the federal funding, was ever charged in the case.",
      "\u201cWe just need to make sure that we put up more firewalls, more security, more ability to make sure that these criminals aren\u2019t able to prey on this,\u201d Walz said.",
      "Thompson said authorities have recovered only about $60 million of the $250 million that was stolen. He declined to speculate on what prosecutors might recommend for sentences but said Bock and Said face \u201csubstantial\u201d prison time.",
      "The defendants are being tried in several groups. The first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock\u2019s trial and additional precautions ordered by the judge.",
      "Despite all that, an allegation of witness tampering surfaced midway through the proceedings. A defendant scheduled for trial in August approached a government witness who was due to testify against Bock and Said and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness declined and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "That defendant, Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, soon agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge and to have his tampering attempt factored into a longer sentencing recommendation, which isn\u2019t binding on the judge.",

      "Members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would hand over the company and up to $7 billion in cash in the latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "Purdue Pharma asked a bankruptcy judge late Tuesday to consider the latest version of its plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin, a deal that would have members of the Sackler family who own the company pay up to $7 billion.",
      "The filing is a milestone in a tumultuous legal saga that has gone on for more than five years.",
      "Under the deal the family members \u2014 estimated in documents from 2020 and 2021 to be worth about $11 billion \u2014 would give up ownership of the company in addition to contributing money over 15 years with the biggest payment up front.",
      "Family members resigned from Purdue's board, stopped receiving money from the company and ceased other involvement before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as it faced lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments, plus others.",
      "The new entity would be run by a board appointed by state governments, and its mission will be to abate the opioid crisis that has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The first wave of deadly overdoses were tied to OxyContin and other prescription drugs, and subsequent waves have involved first heroin and more recently illicit versions of fentanyl.",
      "This settlement plan was hammered out in months of mediation involving groups that sued Purdue, and nearly all of them are supporting it, according to mediator reports filed in court.",
      "Approval would take at least several more months.",
      "A previous version had bankruptcy court approval but was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court because it protected members of the Sackler family from civil lawsuits even though none of them filed for bankruptcy protection themselves.",
      "Under the new version, plaintiffs will have to opt in to get full shares of the settlement. If they do not, they can still sue Sackler family members, who agreed to put in about $1 billion more than under earlier plans. The Sacklers' cash contribution would depends in part on how many parties join the settlement and on the sale of foreign drug companies. Some of the money they put into the settlement is to be reserved to pay any judgments if they are sued and lose; but if that doesn't happen, it's to go into the main settlement.",
      "Members of the family have been cast as villains and have seen their name removed from art galleries and universities around the world because of their role in the privately held company. They continue to deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Other drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacy chains and others have already reached opioid lawsuit settlements worth about $50 billion, according to an Associated Press tally. Purdue's, which would also include about $900 million from company coffers, would be among the largest if finalized.",
      "The deals require most of the money be used to fight the opioid crisis.",
      "Purdue's is the only major one that also provides direct money for victims \u2014 potentially more than $850 million total in pools for people who became addicted, their families and babies born in withdrawal. That figure is more than in the previous incarnation.",
      "The deadline to apply for a piece of those funds passed years ago. In earlier versions, individuals were expected to receive between about $3,500 and $48,000. Families were split over the deal.",
      "Purdue would also provide millions of documents to a repository that would make them public. The company has also been producing a low-cost version of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses.",

      "The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati is hearing arguments in a lawsuit pitting a suburban Ohio school district\u2019s policy on preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati will hear arguments Wednesday in a legal dispute that pits a suburban Ohio school district's policy requiring use of students' preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Parents Defending Education, a national Christian organization, against the Olentangy Local School District in 2023 has captured broad national attention from groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Manhattan Institute. Ohio's solicitor general has asked to participate in oral arguments on behalf of 22 U.S. states that have interests in the case.",
      "A lower court rejected the group\u2019s arguments that the policies violated students\u2019 First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit affirmed that decision in July.",
      "The full court will reconsider that decision in a rare en banc hearing Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The lawsuit takes issue with overlapping district policies that prohibit the use of gender-related language that other students might deem insulting, dehumanizing, unwanted or offensive and call for the use of peers' \u201cpreferred pronouns.\u201d",
      "The district's electronic devices policy \u2014 which applies both on and off school time \u2014 prohibits transmitting \u201cdisruptive\u201d material or material that could be seen as harassing or disparaging other students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other categories.",
      "A separate antidiscrimination policy prohibits students from engaging in \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d during times when they're under the school's authority. That is defined as \u201cverbal or written comments, jokes, and slurs that are derogatory towards an individual or group based on one or more of the following characteristics: race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and transgender identity), disability, age, religion, ancestry, or genetic information.\u201d",
      "The district's code of conduct echoes many of the same themes a third time.",
      "Parents Defending Education, founded in 2021 amid the culture wars over schools\u2019 teachings on race, diversity and sexuality, argues that the policies compel students and parents who belong to their group to \u201caffirm an idea that gender is fluid\u201d in contradiction of their religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cThese students have views that the District disfavors,\u201d the group wrote in a court filing. \u201cSpecifically, they believe that people are either male or female, that biological sex is immutable, and that sex does not change based on someone\u2019s internal feelings. Accordingly, they \u2018d(o) not want to be forced to \u2018affirm\u2019 that a biologically female classmate is actually a male \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 or that a classmate is \u2019nonbinary' and neither male nor female.\u201d",
      "The group argues that the policies unconstitutionally compel \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d speech by forcing students who believe in only two genders to use pronouns that suggest otherwise. They say that violates the First Amendment's guarantees to free speech and similar protections contained in the 14th Amendment, particularly since students are subject to punishment for violating the policies.",
      "Parents Defending Education further challenges the electronic devices policy for applying outside school hours and off school property. The ACLU has sided with the parents' group on this point, arguing the district's policies are overbroad.",
      "Olentangy Local School District outside Columbus, one of the state's largest districts, maintains the policies protect students against abuse and harassment and asserts that Parents Defending Education represents \u201cChristian, cisgender\u201d students \"seeking dispensation under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to harass other students based on their gender identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not illegal immigrants subject to deportation. They are not gay soldiers under Don't Ask Don't Tell. They're not African Americans in the Jim Crow south. They've not been systematically oppressed,\" the district's lawyers told the lower court. \"They're members of the majority who want to \u2014 under the guise of the First Amendment \u2014 openly voice their opposition to an historically maligned minority group, transgendered people.\u201d",
      "Olentangy argues that Parents Defending Education has failed to provide evidence of injury \u2014 as the lawsuit was filed before disciplinary action had been brought against any student. The district also says that its policies leave open other options for students who don't wish to use someone's preferred pronouns. That includes calling the person by their first name, using a gender-neutral pronoun or simply not referring to them at all.",
      "The availability of such options, an argument against the policies unconstitutionally compelling students to say certain things, played a role in the three-judge panel's 2-1 ruling in favor of the district last summer.",

      "A common blood test may miss ovarian cancer in some Black and Native American patients, delaying their treatment, a new study finds. It's the latest example of medical tests that contribute to health care disparities.",
      "Researchers have been working to uncover these kinds of biases in medicine. Recently, the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion has jeopardized such research as universities react to political pressure and federal agencies comb through grants looking for projects that violate the president's orders.",
      "Native American women have the highest rate of ovarian cancer. Black women with ovarian cancer have lower rates of survival compared to white women. Finding ovarian cancer early can lead to better chances of survival.",
      "The new study, supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute and published Thursday in JAMA Network Open, looked at a test called CA-125. The test measures a tumor marker in the blood, and doctors use it to determine if a woman with a suspicious lump should be referred to a cancer specialist.",
      "Doctors depend on the test during early evaluations, so understanding what the results mean for people of different races and ethnicities is critical, said Dr. Shannon Westin of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cThis is a perfect example of work that absolutely needed to be stratified based on race and ethnicity,\" Westin said. The findings alert doctors that they shouldn't be totally reassured by a normal test result, she said.",
      "So far, it\u2019s unknown why the test doesn't perform uniformly across groups. The researchers suspect it has something to do with a harmless genetic variation that is more common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian descent.",
      "Initial studies of the test, published in the 1980s, didn\u2019t record people\u2019s races but were in mostly white populations.",
      "The test isn't perfect for white women either, said lead author Dr. Anna Jo Smith of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school.",
      "\u201cBut if we have worse performance in certain groups, then we may be further contributing to disparities in referral, disparities in treatment, and ultimately we may be contributing to the lower survival in Black women with ovarian cancer,\" Smith said.",
      "The researchers analyzed data from more than 200,000 women with ovarian cancer from 2004 through 2020 who'd had a CA-125 blood test.",
      "Black and Native American patients were 23% less likely to have an elevated CA-125 level at ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with white patients, suggesting the current thresholds are set too high.",
      "The researchers also found that patients with false negative results started chemotherapy on average nine days later than patients with elevated levels. That could make a difference for some patients, Smith said.",
      "Last week, Smith and her colleagues presented work at a Society of Gynecologic Oncology meeting proposing a new lower threshold for the blood test that would work better across all populations. The work could lead to changes in guidelines.",

      "A little over 3.6 million births were reported for 2024, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention preliminary data. That's 22,250 more than the final tally of 2023 U.S. births, which was released Tuesday.",

      "\u201cI\u2019d be hesitant to read much into the 2023-24 increase, and certainly not as an indication of a reversal of the trend towards lower or declining U.S. fertility,\u201d Kohler said, adding that more analysis is needed to understand any changes that happened in birth patterns last year.",
      "U.S. births and birth rates have been falling for years. They dropped most years after the 2008-09 recession, aside from a 2014 uptick. They also dropped in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, then rose for two straight years after that, an increase experts partly attributed to pregnancies put off amid the pandemic.",
      "A 2% drop in 2023 put U.S. births at fewer than 3.6 million, the lowest one-year tally since 1979. Vermont had the lowest birth rate that year, and Utah had the highest, according to Tuesday's 86-page report on 2023 birth data.",
      "The report, based on a review of all the birth certificates filed that year, shows the average age of mothers at first birth has continued to rise, hitting 27 1/2 years. It was 21 1/2 in the early 1970s, before beginning a steady climb.",
      "Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but were rising for women in their 30s and 40s \u2014 a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But in 2023, birth rates fell for women in almost all age groups, include women in their early 40s.",
      "Preliminary birth rate data for 2024 shows a continued decrease among teenagers and women in their early 20s. But it also showed increases for women in their late 20s, due entirely to a rise in births to Hispanic women. Increases also were seen for women in their 30s, due to rises among Hispanic and white women, and those in their 40s, due to rises among white women.",

      "A report published Tuesday identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome\u2019s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology \u2014 all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.",

Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.",
      "The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.",
      "The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida\u2019s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.",

      "Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. \u201cOur innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.\u201d",
      "Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people.

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "A three-judge panel has ruled that Ohio\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and ordered it permanently blocked by a trial court",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked from being enforced, a three-judge panel of appellate judges ruled Tuesday. The law also banned trans women and girls from participating in female sports.",
      "The state attorney general vowed an immediate appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, the state 10th District Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge's decision last summer to allow the law to go into effect, after finding it \u201creasonably limits parents' rights.\u201d The law bans counseling, gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for minors, unless they are already receiving such therapies and a doctor deems it risky to stop.",
      "The litigation was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but specifically discriminates against them accessing it.",
      "The appellate court agreed, in a 2-1 majority opinion written by Judge Carly Edelstein, and cited a number of flaws in the lower court's reasoning.",
      "The judge cited a number of flaws in the lower court\u2019s reasoning. She said that the Ohio law does not outlaw identical drugs when they're used for other reasons, only when they're used for gender transitioning, which makes it discriminatory. She also said that a prescription ban is not a reasonable exercise of the state's police power when it is weighed against the rights of parents to care for their children.",
      "Addressing proponents' arguments that minors are not in a position to understand the long-term impacts such procedures could have on their lives, the judge said that, while they may not be, their parents are.",
      "\u201cThus, in considering whether the H.B. 68 ban is reasonable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the law recognizes the maturity, experience, and capacity of parents to make difficult judgments and act in their children\u2019s best interest,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The ACLU called the ruling \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\"This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians,\" Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's ruling marked the second blow for the legislation.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the law in December 2023, after touring the state to visit children\u2019s hospitals and talking to families of children with gender dysphoria. He cast his action as thoughtful, limited and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 citing the suicide risks associated with minors who don't get proper treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "DeWine simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban gender-affirming surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. He hoped the move would allay concerns of fellow Republicans at the Ohio Statehouse, but the administration swiftly backed off that plan after transgender adults raised serious concerns about how state regulations could impact their lives and health.",
      "Ohio lawmakers stood their ground on the bill, easily overriding his veto \u2014 making Ohio the 23rd state to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a candidate to succeed DeWine next year who serves as the Legislature's lawyer, quickly released a statement saying that he will appeal Tuesday's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a no-brainer \u2013 we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,\" he said. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children.\u201d",
      "Levenson acknowledged that Tuesday's ruling was likely not the end of the legal dispute, but she said in a statement that her organization remained \u201cfervently committed\u201d to preventing the bill from ever taking effect again.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which holds sway in much of northeastern Syria, recently signed a landmark deal with the new government in Damascus that includes a ceasefire and eventual merging of the SDF into the Syrian army.",
      "Meanwhile, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey that has spilled over into conflict in Syria and northern Iraq, recently announced a ceasefire after the group's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, called for its members to put down their weapons.",
      "As the sun set behind the mountains of Akre in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq Thursday, more than 1,500 volunteers climbed the steep hills, carrying burning torches as their faces shimmered in the light of the flame.",
      "From a distance, their movements looked like a river of fire flowing up and down the mountain. At the top, small bonfires burned, while the sky was filled with the flashing colors of fireworks.",
      "Women wearing colorful dresses with gold and silver jewelry and men dressed in traditional outfits with wide belts and turbans danced in the streets of the town and in the hills, Kurdish flags waving above the crowds.",
      "The sound of dahol drums and zurna flutes echoed everywhere, mixed with modern Kurdish folk songs played from loudspeakers.",
      "According to Akre\u2019s directorate of tourism, some 88,000 people attended the event, including Kurds who traveled from around the region and the world. The substantial turnout came despite the fact that this year the festival coincides with Ramadan, during which many Kurds - like other Muslims - fast from sunrise to sunset daily.",
      "Among those dancing on the hill was Hozan Jalil, who traveled from Batman city in Turkey. Jalil said he is happy about the peace process and hopeful that it will bear results, although he was also somewhat circumspect.",

Like Jalil, she voiced hopes that the PKK-Turkey talks would progress and \"achieve peace in all four parts of Kurdistan.\u201d",
      "Across the border in Syria, where former President Bashar Assad was unseated in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Newroz celebrations took place openly in the streets of the capital for the first time in more than a decade since anti-government protests spiraled into a civil war in 2011.",

    "story": [
      "Over 12 years, Francis has sought to normalize the papacy with his informal style and disdain for pomp while still wielding the awesome power of the papacy",
      "VATICAN CITY -- During his first foreign trip in 2013, Pope Francis made headlines when he carried his own black leather briefcase as he boarded the Alitalia charter bound for Brazil, since popes never carry bags and until the 1970s were themselves carried on thrones.",
      "Asked what was in the bag, Francis joked that it wasn\u2019t the nuclear codes. But he seemed baffled that something as normal as an airplane passenger carrying a briefcase could create such a fuss.",
      "\u201cI have always taken a bag with me when travelling \u2013 it\u2019s normal,\u201d he told his first news conference as pope. \u201cWe must get used to being normal. The normality of life.\u201d",
      "Over 12 years, Francis has sought that kind of normality for the papacy with his informal style and disdain for pomp while ensuring that he still wields the awesome power held by Christ\u2019s vicar on Earth and Europe\u2019s last absolute monarch.",
      "The way Francis has managed his five-week hospitalization for pneumonia has followed that same playbook: He has allowed the public to follow the very normal ups and downs of an 88-year-old man battling a complex lung infection through spare but regular medical bulletins, while also continuing to run the 1.3-billion strong Catholic Church.",
      "In between respiratory crises, prayer and physiotherapy, Francis has appointed over a dozen bishops, approved a handful of new saints, authorized a three-year extension of his signature reform process and sent off messages public and private. Vatican cardinals have stood in for him at events requiring his presence.",
      "That\u2019s not as easy a balancing act as it sounds, since there are few positions of power that are both as absolute as the papacy and, during times of illness, as seemingly fragile: According to the church's canon law, the pope possesses \u201csupreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary power in the church.\" He answers to no one but God, and there is no appeal of his decisions.",
      "And while popes aren\u2019t subject to re-election campaigns or no-confidence votes, they essentially owe their jobs to the 120 men who elected them. While those same cardinals swear obedience to the pope, they will ultimately choose his successor from within their own ranks. It's no surprise then that talk of conclaves, papal contenders and challenges facing a future pope has been a constant buzz in Rome ever since Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital Feb. 14.",
      "Francis is well aware that anytime he has gone into the hospital, the plotting has begun for electing the next pope, contributing to a certain lame duck status. \u201cSome wanted me dead,\u201d he said after his 2021 hospitalization, when he learned that secret meetings had already been held to plan the conclave. He knows as well that even before his current hospitalization, an anonymous cardinal had circulated a seven-point memo listing priorities for the next pope to correct the \u201cconfusion, division and conflict\u201d sowed by Francis.",
      "And yet Francis has never been shy about showing his weaknesses, age or infirmities in ways that seem unthinkable for public figures for whom any sign of fragility can threaten their authority and undermine their agenda.",
      "Within months of being elected, for example, Francis reached out to an Argentine doctor and journalist, Dr. Nelson Castro, and suggested he write a book about the health of popes, himself included.",
      "\u201cMy hypothesis is that he wanted first of all to show himself as a human being,\u201d Castro said in an interview. \u201cWe tend to see popes like saints, but the way he talked about his diseases showed me, \u2018I\u2019m like you and me, being exposed to diseases.\u2019\u201d",
      "Francis had read and appreciated Castro\u2019s earlier book, \u201cThe Sickness of Power,\u201d about the ailments that have afflicted Argentina\u2019s leaders and how power itself had afflicted them. He invited Castro to research and write about past popes and his own case in a similar light.",
      "\u201cThe Health of Popes\u201d was published in 2021. Castro said what struck him most was that Francis disclosed not only his physical ailments, but his mental health challenges too: Francis revealed that he had gone to a psychiatrist when he was the Jesuit provincial during Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s to help him cope with fear and anxiety.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a man of power,\u201d Castro said. \u201cOnly a man of power, feeling quite sure of himself, would dare to talk about his diseases so openly.\u201d",
      "For the Rev. John Cecero, who was Jesuit provincial for the northeast United States from 2014-2020, Francis\u2019 willingness to show his weaknesses while exercising supreme authority is consistent with his Jesuit training and the biblical teaching of St. Paul that \u201cwhen I am weak, then I am strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cA chief virtue on the part of everyone in the practice of Jesuit authority is humility,\" Cecero said in an interview. \"On the part of the individual Jesuit (that means) thinking beyond my own self-interest to the common good.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s something that drives Francis: that you have that same humility,\u201d he said.",
      "And yet Francis\u2019 critics often complain that he\u2019s authoritarian, that he takes decisions in a vacuum and without regard to the law, and wields power like a \u201cDictator Pope,\u201d the title of a book written by a traditionalist critic early in Francis\u2019 papacy.",
      "Many recite the joke about the way Jesuit superiors exercise power, which is supposed to be a process of joint discernment between the superior and the underling but, the joke goes, it can be anything but: \u201cI discern, you discern, we discern \u2026 I decide.\u201d",
      "Those same conservative critics, of course, have been keenly watching Francis\u2019 hospitalization and wondering if the end of his papacy is near.",
      "Even if he is absent, and even if he has to cut back his public activities going forward, Francis is very much still in power and leading the church, said Kurt Martens, a canon lawyer at Catholic University of America in Washington D.C.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing a pope who is everywhere all the time,\" he said. \"But don't forget that in the past, not that long ago, popes would show up only rarely.\u201d",
      "Francis' disappearance from public view has led some to doubt the authenticity of the first, and so far only photograph of Francis released by the Vatican since his hospitalization. It was shot from behind and showed Francis at prayer in his private hospital chapel, his face hidden.",
      "Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops\u2019 conference, said the photo was not only real but showed Francis controlling the image that he wants the faithful to have of the papacy and his illness. Francis wants viewers to focus not on the spectacle of a sick pope, but on what should actually matter more to a Catholic anyway.",
      "\u201cIf we cannot see his face ... what we must look at is precisely what he himself is facing: the altar and the crucifix,\u201d Avvenire wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Electric tricycles are transforming the lives of some women in parts of rural Zimbabwe",
      "WEDZA, Zimbabwe -- Anna Bhobho, a 31-year-old housewife from rural Zimbabwe, was once a silent observer in her home, excluded from financial and family decision-making in the deeply patriarchal society. Today, she is a driver of change in her village, thanks to an electric tricycle she now owns.",
      "In many parts of rural sub-Saharan Africa, women have long been excluded from mainstream economic activities such as operating public transportation. However, three-wheelers powered by green energy are reversing that trend, offering financial opportunities and a newfound sense of importance.",
      "\u201cMy husband now looks up to me to take care of a large chunk of expenses, including buying furniture and other assets,\u201d Bhobho said at a market where she delivers crops for farmers in Wedza district, about 150 kilometers (nearly 100 miles) from Harare.",
      "Called \u201cHamba,\u201d meaning \u201cgo\u201d in Ndebele, the tricycles are powered by solar-charged lithium-ion batteries. Mobility for Africa, a local startup, piloted the project in 2019 by leasing the vehicles to groups of women for $15 a month. Today, individual women like Bhobho can own them through a lease-to-purchase program.",
      "\u201cI used to depend on my husband for everything, even money for bread,\u201d she said.",
      "Bhobho now owns land, has opened a small grocery store, is paying off a car and has moved her children from an underfunded rural public school to a better-equipped private institution. She earns up to $300 a month, comparable to government workers like schoolteachers.",
      "Beyond material gains, she has gained self-esteem.",
      "\u201cEven my husband and in-laws have more respect for me now. No one used to listen to me, but now I have a seat when important decisions are being made,\u201d the mother of three said.",
      "According to Carlin Thandi Ngandu, the community engagement coordinator for Mobility for Africa, 300 women across Zimbabwe are part of the program, with a goal of ensuring that 70% of the beneficiaries are women.",
      "In Wedza, only women own and operate the tricycles. They receive training in safe driving skills, and swapping a lithium battery for a fully recharged one after about 100 kilometers (about 70 miles) costs $1.",
      "Motorcycles are a common public transport in sub-Saharan Africa, with some now switching to electric to cut fuel costs. The United Nations environmental program is introducing electric two and three-wheelers in nine countries, mostly in East Africa. In Nigeria, a green energy firm and the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign Office are providing 120 electric three-wheelers to women, promoting sustainability and economic empowerment.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the lives of many women have changed dramatically, even for those who don\u2019t own tricycles but use them for daily chores. Gone are the days of carrying firewood, buckets of water or heavy farm produce over long distances.",
      "The tricycles, able to navigate narrow paths inaccessible to cars, reach remote homesteads and vegetable gardens. Their affordability makes them accessible to locals.",
      "Hilda Takadini, a tomato farmer, said her business has flourished since she started using Bhobho\u2019s transport services. Previously, she had to leave home at 3 a.m., using an ox-drawn cart to travel 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the market. Often, she arrived too late or not at all, and her tomatoes rotted.",
      "\u201cI get better prices because now I reach the market on time with my tomatoes still fresh. Even the children now know they can rely on me for school fees,\u201d said the 34-year-old mother of six.",
      "At Wedza shopping center, nearly a dozen women line up with their tricycles, which can carry loads of up to 450 kilograms (nearly 1,000 pounds) and have a top speed of 60 kph (37 mph), waiting for customers. They transport passengers, patients heading to hospitals and people carrying building materials such as bricks, groceries and firewood.",
      "However, the women have to contend with challenges such as rough terrain worsened by recent rains, as well as a number of men resistant to seeing women lead in traditionally male-dominated spaces, Bhobho said.",
      "Beyond business, the tricycles are revolutionizing health care access, particularly for women and children. Josephine Nyevhe, a volunteer community health worker, uses her tricycle to bring medical services closer to rural families.",
      "On a recent afternoon, a group of mothers with children waited at a roadside. Nyevhe arrived on her tricycle, hung a weighing scale on a tree branch and began measuring the children\u2019s growth. She recorded details in her notebook, offered nutrition advice and referred severe cases to the local clinic.",
      "Many times, her tricycle has served as a village ambulance.",
      "\u201cI am on 24-hour standby. I get calls during odd hours and have to rush people to the hospital. Sometimes it\u2019s a pregnant woman who would have otherwise given birth at home in unsafe conditions,\u201d said Nyevhe, wearing her brown uniform.",

      "Friday\u2019s court ruling declared unconstitutional the exclusion of singles from international adoptions under a 1983 Italian law, which allowed only married couples to pursue international adoptions.",
      "According to Italy\u2019s top court, the exclusion of single people risked undermining \"the effectiveness of the child\u2019s right to grow up in a stable and harmonious family environment.\u201d",
      "The court decision also reflects concerns among adoption advocates over a downward trend in Italy\u2019s international adoption over the past few years, due to increasing difficulties for couples in completing adoptions abroad and the high costs related to the lengthy process.",
      "According to Italy\u2019s international adoption commission, in the first semester of 2024 international adoption in the country fell by 5.6% from the same period a year before and by 14.3% from the first semester of 2022.",
      "Italy's right-wing government headed by Premier Giorgia Meloni has opposed singles' adoptions in court, but the country's center-left opposition hailed Friday's ruling as a \u201chistoric turning point.\u201d",

      "ISLAMABAD -- The U.N. children\u2019s agency on Saturday urged Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers to immediately lift a lingering ban on girls' education to save the future of millions who have been deprived of their right to education since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.",
      "The appeal by UNICEF comes as a new school year began in Afghanistan without girls beyond sixth grade. The ban, said the agency, has deprived 400,000 more girls of their right to education, bringing the total to 2.2 million.",
      "Afghanistan is the only country in the world that bans female secondary and higher education, with the Taliban justifying the ban saying it doesn't comply with their interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "\u201cFor over three years, the rights of girls in Afghanistan have been violated,\" Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said in a statement. \u201cAll girls must be allowed to return to school now. If these capable, bright young girls continue to be denied an education, then the repercussions will last for generations.\u201d",
      "A ban on the education of girls will harm the future of millions of Afghan girls, she said, adding that if the ban persists until 2030, \"more than four million girls will have been deprived of their right to education beyond primary school.\u201d The consequences, she added, will be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "Russell warned that the decline in female doctors and midwives will leave women and girls without crucial medical care. This situation is projected to result in an estimated 1,600 additional maternal deaths and over 3,500 infant deaths. \u201cThese are not just numbers, they represent lives lost and families shattered,\u201d she said.",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- A 19-year-old died on Friday in a hospital in Serbia, becoming the 16th fatality in the collapse of a concrete canopy at a train station last November. The tragedy triggered months of anti-corruption protests rattling Serbia's populist government.",
      "Vukasin Crncevic died more than four months after tons of concrete crashed down on Nov. 1 without warning on him and other people outside the central train station in the northern city of Novi Sad.",
      "Many in Serbia believe the deadly crash was the result of poor renovation work on the station building which resulted from rampant government corruptio n, negligence and disrespect of the safety regulations.",
      "Months-long protests demanding accountability over the crash have drawn hundreds of thousands of people. Daily protests and blockades have up to now included 15-minute silence for those who had died in the disaster.",

      "Interior Minister Juan Jos\u00e9 Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez by law has 72 hours to leave his position after the no-confidence vote, which succeeded with 78 votes in favor, 11 against and 20 abstentions. Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez insisted that he had worked hard alongside police during his 10 months in office, but that he would respect the lawmakers' decision.",
      "Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez must step down and take responsibility for his \u201cinability to address the wave of citizen insecurity the country is facing,\u201d the Peruvian Congress said on its X account.",
      "Public outrage has surged over an increase in killings and other violence, especially the killing Sunday of Paul Flores, the 39-year-old lead singer of the cumbia band Armonia 10. He was fatally shot when assailants attacked his band's tour bus after a concert in Lima.",
      "In reaction to the Flores killing, President Dina Boluarte on Monday declared a state of emergency in the capital and ordered the deployment of soldiers to help police address the surge of violence. That same day, opposition lawmakers requested a vote of no confidence against the interior minister.",
      "Boluarte\u2019s government previously had decreed a state of emergency from September to December in an attempt to stem the violence.",
      "Authorities reported 2,057 killings in 2024, up from 1,506 in 2023.",

      "Frustration runs high in sprawling camps of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the freeze on American foreign aid",
      "COX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh -- They first faced persecution in their country. Then a deadly crackdown by Myanmar\u2019s army sent hundreds of thousands fleeing into Bangladesh. Driven from their homes, many of the Rohingya have since lived in refugee settlements entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance.",
      "That assistance \u2014 largely led by the United States \u2014 is at the risk of being cut, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decree to freeze most of his country\u2019s foreign aid. For more than 1 million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh it means they could be left with too little food and money for survival.",
      "No cuts have happened yet. But the U.N. World Food Program said if it is not able to raise funds, it will have no option but to halve food rations to $6 a month from previous $12.50 in the country's southern coastal district of Cox\u2019s Bazar, where the Rohingya live in sprawling camps.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the WFP\u2019s decision was directly related to the Trump administration\u2019s action, but during a recent visit to the refugee camps, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres criticized the U.S. and other countries in Europe for halting or reducing their aid budgets.",
      "To be sure, a large portion of funds needed for supporting Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh has come from the U.S. Agency for International Development, but the country\u2019s government and dozens of aid organizations also look after their daily needs. Yet, any drop in humanitarian aid could have extreme impact on the lives of Rohingya refugees.",
      "\u201cCox\u2019s Bazar is ground zero for the impact of budget cuts on people in desperate need,\u201d Guterres said last week during his visit to the camps. He said that drastic cuts in humanitarian aid are \u201ca crime\u201d and urged the international community to continue to support the Rohingya refugees.",
      "Aid workers have warned that aid cuts \u2014 if they become effective in April \u2014 will devastate the lives of the refugees, especially women and children. \u201cWe will have no choice but to reduce rations starting in April,\" said WFP spokesperson Kun Li.",
      "Before being forced from Myanmar, farmer Mahabub Alam was an influential figure in his community, serving as the chairman of a local government body in a village in western Rakhine state. Today, the 56-year-old says, he is broke and his nine-member family solely depends on aid, because like other refugees he is not formally allowed to work outside the refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar.",
      "Alam has been worried, even shocked, since he first heard that food rations could be cut to half from next month.",
      "\u201cWe will not be able to live on that ($6 a month), and we will die here,\u201d said Alam, who has been living in the camp since 2017, after fleeing the Myanmar military's brutal attacks on the Rohingya.",
      "The $6 allowance per month will only be sufficient for minimum quantities of rations, Alam said. According to UNICEF, more than 15% of children in the camps are acutely malnourished.",
      "\u201cEarlier, we used to be able to eat something, have medications, and fish, but now we won\u2019t be able to have any of them,\u201d he said.",
      "Alam\u2019s worries are not only limited to having access to food and financial support. He said aid cuts could also fuel unrest in the camps, where groups among the refugees have sometimes clashed over essentials and to establish supremacy.",
      "\u201cThere will be an increase in number of thieves and robbers here. People will get kidnapped, things will be stolen, and unrest will increase. The situation will worsen,\u201d Alam said.",
      "He said he'd rather go back to Myanmar \u2014 but only if there are guarantees for safety. In reality, returning is not option for the refugees, as military-ruled Myanmar is mired in a civil war.",
      "The aid cuts \u2014 if they do come \u2014 could also cause major concern for camp residents who need money for medical treatment.",
      "\u201cIt will be very difficult for us to live,\u201d said Tomida Khatun, 46, who arrived to Cox's Bazar with her family in 2017. \u201cWe have diseases, high blood pressure and diabetes. We need money for treatment, but we will not have any.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are worried about how we are going to feed our children. How are we going to send them to school?\" Khatun said.",
      "The monthly food ration of $12.50 for each member of her family is already stretched to the limit, she said, and the funding shortfall could only makes things worse.",

      "BEIJING -- U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, is visiting Beijing as the U.S. and China swap tariff threats and harsh words over each others' handling of the illegal trade in fentanyl.",
      "Daines, a Republican from Montana, arrived in the Chinese capital on Thursday after meeting top leaders in Vietnam, according to social media posts by him and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.",
      "He said on X earlier this week that he would be talking with Chinese officials about curbing the production and distribution of fentanyl and \u201cthe need to reduce the trade deficit and ensure fair market access for our Montana farmers, ranchers and producers.\u201d",
      "His office said ahead of the trip that he is coordinating closely with the White House and will be \u201ccarrying President Trump's America First agenda.\"",
      "Daines previously worked as an executive for U.S. companies in China and served as a go-between during Trump's first term in office when tariffs were also a major issue. He is the first member of Congress to visit Beijing since Trump took office in January.",
      "U.S.-China tensions have spiked as the U.S. imposed 20% duties on Chinese goods, drawing retaliatory tariffs of 15% on U.S. farm goods from China this past week. The U.S. accuses China of doing too little to stop the export of precursor materials for fentanyl, a highly potent opiate blamed for tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S.",
      "China responded with a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China, and the foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing\u2019s goodwill with tariffs.",
      "The report said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.",
      "China is committed to cooperation, the report said, \u201cbut firmly opposes the U.S. imposition of unlawful sanctions and unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.\u201d",

      "Mysterious deaths, unexplained noises and late-night apparitions are not the usual fodder of daily tours offered at New Zealand's parliament in Wellington",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A veiled woman burst screaming from an elevator. The small crowd gathered in a basement corridor of New Zealand \u2019s parliament drew back nervously.",
      "Their guide, wearing a trailing, white gown, smiled sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to take the elevator,\u201d she said. Nobody did.",
      "Mysterious deaths, unexplained noises and late-night apparitions are not the usual fodder of daily tours offered at the parliament buildings in Wellington. After hours on Thursday, however, guides donned Victorian-era garb to regale visitors with the precinct\u2019s less savory history \u2014 \u201cmostly factual\u201d tales of real-world tragedy and paranormal lore that have grown established among political staffers through decades of colorful retelling.",
      "The history of parliament\u2019s stately gothic library is particularly rich in woe. Constructed in the late 19th century and feared by some of parliament\u2019s night shift security guards and cleaners, it has survived two fires, a flood and being overrun by feral cats.",
      "\u201cThis is your last chance to back out,\u201d Lisa Brand, her face dripping with fake blood, told the group who had arrived for Thursday's tour \u2014 a recent initiative and one embraced by the visitors\u2019 center staff with gusto.",
      "Walking through a cavernous parliamentary atrium, the guide let out a hair-raising scream that echoed up to the open windows of lawmakers\u2019 offices. It explained why the so-called spooky tours are reserved for weeks when parliament is not in session.",
      "Parliament's library is a gloomy and ornate building where stained-glass windows and crystal chandeliers dimly reveal wrought iron bannisters and Venetian d\u00e9cor. Designed by Thomas Turnbull and completed in 1899, it remains in use by staff seeking information or some slightly eerie peace and quiet.",
      "When the visitors arrived Thursday, they were greeted by spectral figures who shrieked as they glided down staircases beneath the portraits of former head librarians and New Zealand prime ministers. Tour guides told a hushed audience that the library was imperiled by a savage storm that struck Wellington in 1968 \u2014 sinking a passenger ferry in the harbor with the deaths of 53 people.",
      "The tempest lashed parliament too, tearing out skylights and prompting librarians to climb onto the roof as they tried to protect the books, according to a guide who sported Victorian garb and dark shadows under her eyes.",
      "\u201cFor mysterious and unknown reasons they did this in their underwear,\u201d she told the visitors. \u201cThere seems to be a history of people losing their pants here in this parliament.\u201d",
      "The guide added, with relish: \u201cI haven\u2019t even started on the politicians.\u201d",
      "Eventually the tour turned to lawmakers, too. Well-known in New Zealand is the story of William Larnach, a politician who in 1898 was found dead in a room at parliament with a revolver in his hand while experiencing financial and family strife.",
      "Larnach\u2019s ghost, some claim, remains in the building. His skull, however, was stolen \u2014 and in 1972 was rediscovered in a college student\u2019s bedroom.",
      "Another spirit reported to linger is that of the first full-time librarian, Ewen McColl, whose death was partly attributed by some official sources to overwork.",
      "As the tour descended to the building's basement, the ceilings grew low and the corridors narrow. Frantic banging resounded from an apparently locked room.",
      "The subterranean floors are home to an archive containing the historical and esoteric. It's also the site of some of the building\u2019s strangest reported occurrences, tour guides said.",
      "Urban legends passed down by staff include stories of hands reaching out from the stacks, songs emanating from empty bathrooms, the apparition of a ghostly woman in a mirror, and locked doors swinging open. More earthly horrors included a cat, and subsequent flea, infestation in 1977.",
      "After one last fright, visitors emerged slightly shaken into Parliament\u2019s near-empty lobby as darkness fell. The tour was \u201ca bit spookier than I expected,\u201d said Holly Masters, who had last visited parliament as a child. \u201cThere was quite a few deaths here that I did not expect to find out about.\u201d",
      "Another visitor, Sally Giles, said she was fascinated to learn the stories of those who worked and died in the precinct \u201cand what they\u2019ve left behind and how that surfaces every now and then.\u201d",
      "The tour guides would return to their regular, authorized scripts on Friday\u2019s tours \u2014 but some said the building's spooky side was never far away.",
      "\u201cI always open up the tour route in the morning,\u201d said Brand, the team leader. \u201cIt does always feel a bit tingly when you\u2019re one of the first people walking around.\u201d",

      "Turkey's opposition party has urged supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition on Friday renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the call as irresponsible.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that the courts operate independently.",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for night-time rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, the capital, Ankara, and Turkey\u2019s third largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University, where police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration and students claimed rubber bullets were used. The government has denied the use of the bullets.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate but said street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a fresh appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said the primary, where some 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday - through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey - to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "It was not clear when authorities would begin questioning the mayor, who can be detained without charges for up to four days. Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",

      "Two of Pope Francis\u2019 closest advisers are predicting that he will recover from pneumonia and that a \u201cnew stage\u201d in his pontificate will open after he is released",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis is recovering well from pneumonia and a \u201cnew stage\u201d in his pontificate is opening, two of his closest advisers said Friday, offering notes of optimism as the 88-year-old pontiff hit the five-week mark in his hospitalization.",
      "Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra told The Associated Press that he had found Francis in good humor and serene during the three times he has visited the pope at the Gemelli hospital in Rome.",
      "Pe\u00f1a Parra, who is the Vatican chief of staff, visited Francis on Feb. 24, March 2 and March 9 along with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the lone Vatican officials who have called on him aside from his personal secretaries.",
      "\u201cThe pope will recover,\" Pe\u00f1a Parra said on the sidelines of a book launch. \u201cThe pope is recovering well. The doctors say that he needs some time, but it\u2019s going well progressively.\"",
      "\u201cI found him well, serene, in good humor, and \u2014 just like him \u2014 tough with the desire to go forward,\u201d he said.",
      "The Vatican press office reported Friday that Francis' overall condition remained stable, with slight improvements as he continues respiratory and physical physiotherapy. He was continuing to reduce his reliance on high-flow supplemental oxygen he has needed to breathe during the day and no longer needs the mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "In other comments Friday, another top friend and ally of the pope, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, said that \u201ca new stage\u201d was opening in Francis\u2019 12-year pontificate and that he expects some surprises from the pontiff when he's released.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez, the Argentine theologian who Francis brought in as the Vatican\u2019s doctrine chief, said that he had been in touch with Francis since his Feb. 14 hospitalization and was heartened that he had stabilized. He provided no time frame on when Francis might be released, but ruled out any thought that he might resign.",
      "He said that he understood that Francis was responding well to treatment, but that doctors were keeping him at the hospital \u201cto be 100%.\u201d He said that Francis needed rehabilitation therapy to help him regain strength to speak after so many weeks on noninvasive mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez revealed that Francis had resisted going to the hospital when his bronchitis worsened, and only agreed to go after people close to him threatened to quit if he didn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what swear words they used (to tell him) you have to go there, otherwise we go home and end our relationship here,\u201d he said.",
      "As a result, he said he knew that the hospitalization had been hard on Francis and had surely made him reflect.",
      "\u201cI think a new stage is opening for him. He is a man of surprises, who will surely have learned so many things in this month and he\u2019ll pull who knows what out of the hat,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even knowing that this has been a very heavy effort for him, a difficult time, I know it will be fruitful for the church and for the world.\u201d",
      "Francis hit the five-week mark in his hospitalization Friday. He was admitted Feb. 14 with a bad case of bronchitis that developed into a complex lung infection and double pneumonia. He has long battled respiratory illnesses and had part of one lung removed when he was a young man. He has admitted to being a bad patient and is a known workaholic.",
      "\u201cHe wants to spend what little time he has left and says \u2018I want to use it and not to take care of myself,\u2019\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cAnd then what happens? He comes back here and it\u2019s not easy for him to follow the advice\u201d of doctors.",
      "That might change after this experience, he said.",
      "\u201cHe has to certainly change, but I can't say what those details might be,\u201d he said.",

      "The official Korean Central News Agency said that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the tests Thursday and called the missiles involved \u201canother major defense weapons system\u201d for North Korea.",
      "The missile launches, North Korea\u2019s sixth weapons testing activity this year, occurred on the same day that the U.S. and South Korean militaries concluded their annual Freedom Shield command post exercise. The 11-day training was the allies\u2019 first major joint military exercises since the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January, and the two countries held diverse field training exercises alongside the Freedom Shield drills.",
      "U.S. and South Korean officials describe their combined military drills as defensive in nature, but North Korea slams them as a major security threat. Hours after this year's Freedom Shield training began on March 10, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea.",
      "On Friday, the North Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry alleged the recent U.S.-South Korean drills involved simulations to destroy underground tunnels in the North to remove its nuclear weapons. An unidentified ministry spokesperson said the U.S. and South Korea would face consequences if they perform similar provocative actions again.",
      "\u201cThe accumulated reckless military moves of the U.S. and the ROK, seized with the daydream that they can jeopardize the sovereignty and security of a nuclear weapons state, can undoubtedly bring the gravest consequences they do not want,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement carried in KCNA.",
      "ROK is the Republic of Korea, South Korea\u2019s official name.",
      "North Korea often churns out warlike rhetoric and threats of attacks when the U.S. and South Korea militaries conduct big drills.",
      "Trump has said he's willing to reach out to Kim to revive their diplomacy, but North Korea hasn't made any public responses to Trump's overture. Many experts say Kim, now preoccupied with his support of Russia's war efforts against Ukraine, won't likely embrace Trump's outreach anytime soon, but could seriously consider it when the war ends.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times in 2018-19 to discuss North Korea's possible nuclear disarmament, but their diplomacy eventually fell apart due to disputes over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian drones pummeled the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, injuring three people and sparking massive fires, officials said Friday, an attack that underlined Moscow's intention to pursue aerial attacks even as it agreed to temporarily halt strikes on energy facilities.",
      "The strike came shortly before Czech Republic President Peter Pavel visited Odesa early Friday morning and held meetings with the city's leaders and officials from other southern regions.",
      "\u201cThis is another reminder to the whole world: the war continues and Ukraine continues to fight,\u201d the head of the Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, said in a statement.",
      "He reported blazes at at least three locations after the attack late Thursday. \u201cCivilian infrastructure, commercial facilities are on fire, cars damaged,\u201d Kiper said.",
      "Over 70 people and 20 fire engines were involved in extinguishing what the emergency services called \u201cmassive fires.\u201d",
      "In another attack, Russian glide bombs injured at least six people, including a child, in the Zaporizhzhia region overnight Thursday to Friday. Regional head Ivan Fedorov published photos showing fire fighters extinguishing flames at multiple damaged residential buildings.",
      "The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired 214 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks. It said 114 of them were intercepted and another 81 were jammed.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said air defenses shot down 43 Ukrainian drones, 34 of them over the Volgograd region and others over Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions. The authorities didn\u2019t report any casualties or significant damage.",
      "Meanwhile, a massive blaze at an oil depot in the Krasnodar region has continued to rage since it was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack late Wednesday.",
      "Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries\u2019 leaders this week, though it remained to be seen what possible targets would be off limits to attack.",
      "After a roughly hourlong call with Trump on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that \u201ctechnical\u201d talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected from attack under the agreement.",
      "The three sides appeared to hold starkly different views about what the deal covered. While the White House said \u201cenergy and infrastructure\u201d would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to \u201cenergy infrastructure.\" Zelenskyy said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized Friday that the agreement reached between Trump and Putin referred only to energy facilities, adding that the Russian military is fulfilling Putin's order to halt such attacks for 30 days.",
      "\u201cThe Russian military are currently refraining from strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached between Russia and the United States,\u201d Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.",

      "ANCIENT OLYMPIA, Greece -- New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art has returned an ancient bronze griffin head stolen nearly a century ago to a museum in southern Greece, the latest repatriation marking a broader shift in the museum world to return significant artifacts.",
      "The 7th century B.C. artifact was on display at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia, the city that in ancient times was the birthplace of the games that later inspired the modern Olympic Games.",
      "Greece\u2019s culture minister, Lina Mendoni, attended a ceremony Friday at the museum, calling the return a significant moment.",
      "\u201cAfter decades of absence, the griffin returns from the Metropolitan Museum in New York to the place it belongs,\u201d she said, praising the joint effort by the Culture Ministry and the Met to trace the artifact\u2019s past. The ceremony coincided with a visit to Greece by members of the International Olympic Committee to elect a new president. Kirsty Coventry became the first woman and first African to lead the global body.",
      "The griffin, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle, symbolized strength and divine protection in ancient Greece. The bronze head will now be displayed alongside a similar griffin head already at the Olympia museum.",
      "The Met has recently increased its efforts to review the history of its holdings, hiring additional experts to track the origins of objects in its collection.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful for our long-standing partnership with the Greek government and look forward to continued engagement and cultural exchange,\u201d the Met's museum director Max Hollein said in a statement.",
      "Institutions across the world in recent years have begun to acknowledge the importance of returning significant cultural items while still promoting global access to heritage. As part of this new framework, Greece has agreed to loan the griffin head back to the Met for future exhibitions, Mendoni said. Athens is hoping the new, more open approach will boost its decades-long campaign for the return of the Parthenon Sculptures, taken from the Acropolis in Athens in the 19th century and now in the British Museum. The government \u2014 citing their cultural importance and illegal removal \u2014 says it is making slow progress in negotiations with the London museum.",

      "Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has appeared before police for questioning on terror-related charges a day after his interrogation over corruption allegations",
      "ISTANBUL -- Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu appeared before police for questioning on terror-related charges on Saturday, a day after his interrogation over corruption allegations. His arrest this week has sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition.",
      "Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on social media that 343 suspects had been detained in protests in major cities on Friday night, adding \u201cThere will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people\u2019s peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.\u201d The cities listed included Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Antalya, \u00c7anakkale, Eski\u015fehir, Konya and Edirne.",
      "The mayor, who is a popular opposition figure and seen as a top challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was detained on Wednesday following a dawn raid on his residence over allegations of financial crimes and links to Kurdish militants. Dozens of other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey\u2019s courts operate independently.",
      "On Friday, police questioned Imamoglu for four hours over the corruption accusations, during which he denied all of the charges, Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported. He was expected to be transferred to a courthouse later on Saturday for questioning by prosecutors and to face possible charges.",
      "His arrest has ignited protests that have steadily increased in intensity.",
      "On Friday, police in Istanbul used pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets to push back hundreds of protesters who tried to break through a barricade in front of the city\u2019s historic aqueduct while hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers. Police also dispersed groups that had rallied outside of the city hall for a third night running, after the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party leader, Ozgur Ozel, delivered a speech in support of the mayor.",
      "Simultaneously, police broke up demonstrations in Ankara, the capital, as well as in the Aegean coastal city of Izmir, resorting to forceful measures at times, according to television images. Thousands marched in several other cities calling on the government to resign.",
      "Earlier, Erdogan said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and terror organizations. Authorities in Ankara and Izmir meanwhile, announced a five-day ban on demonstrations, following a similar measure imposed earlier in Istanbul.",
      "\u201cAn anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "In a message posted on his social media account Saturday, Imamoglu described his arrest as a \u201ccoup\" and accused the government of exploiting the judiciary and worsening the country\u2019s troubled economy.",
      "\u201cWith your support, we will first defeat this coup, and then we will send packing those who caused this,\u201d he wrote on the social media platform X.",

      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to trigger the process for an early parliamentary election this weekend for an expected vote on April 28.",
      "The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has totally upended Canadian politics.",
      "What Trump hasn't said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada's sovereignty have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips south of the border and avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "Carney will visit Governor-General Mary Simon on Sunday and request to dissolve Parliament, a government official who wasn\u2019t authorized to publicly give details so spoke on condition of anonymity on Thursday.",
      "Requests by the prime minister to the governor-general are rubber-stamped. Simon\u2019s office holds a constitutional and ceremonial role as the representative of Canada\u2019s head of state, U.K. King Charles III. Canada is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "An election campaign lasting about five weeks will then officially begin.",
      "People throughout Canada will elect all 338 member of the House of Commons, one for each constituency. There are no primaries or runoffs, just a single round of voting.",
      "Canada is like Britain in that uses a \u201cfirst past the post\u201d system of voting, which means that the candidate that finishes top in each constituency will be elected, even if they don\u2019t get 50% of the vote.",
      "This has generally cemented the dominance of the two largest parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, because it's difficult for smaller parties to win seats unless they have concentrated support in particular areas.",
      "The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.",
      "Carney replaced Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing Liberal Party.",
      "He was sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on March 14. Carney said Thursday in this time of crisis that the government needs a strong and clear mandate.",
      "Carney, 60, is among the two main candidates. He navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694.",
      "His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "A highly educated economist with Wall Street experience, Carney worked for 13 years for Goldman Sachs in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He has both financial industry and public service credentials.",
      "Carney still hasn\u2019t had a phone call with Trump yet. He has said that he\u2019s ready to meet with Trump, if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty.",
      "Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney's main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada\u2019s federal election this year until Trump\u2019s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.",
      "Poilievre, 45, for years the party\u2019s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put \u201cCanada first.\u201d He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada\u2019s public broadcaster. His party announced that it won't allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s tariffs and his rhetoric about Canada becoming the 51st state have clearly helped the Liberals in the polls while putting the Conservatives in an odd position, as their rhetoric exhibits some similarities with Trump\u2019s and a significant minority of their supporters like the President\u2019s populist style and ideas,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",

      "More than a year after Panama\u2019s Supreme Court halted operations at a huge copper mine because its government concession was deemed unconstitutional, there\u2019s a fresh push with the new Panamanian president to restart the mine",
      "DONOSO, Panama -- More than a year after Panama\u2019s Supreme Court halted operations at a huge copper mine because its government concession was deemed unconstitutional, the country's new administration is signaling a potential restart.",
      "Business groups are lobbying President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who says he\u2019ll start discussing the mine\u2019s future with his team next week. The mine\u2019s owner is conducting media tours and has said it will suspend arbitration, while the coalition of environmental and civic groups that snarled traffic for weeks in 2023 calling for the mine\u2019s closure is preparing to hit the streets again.",
      "Mulino has already ordered that the mine\u2019s power plant be restarted and that some $250 million worth of copper concentrate sitting at the mine be sold. And on Thursday, he appeared to signal where he was leaning.",
      "Noting the mine\u2019s economic impact \u2014 it accounted for nearly 5% of Panama gross domestic product the last year it operated \u2014 Mulino said: \u201cOn what basis can I say, as president of the republic, \u2019good-bye, to the mine, there won\u2019t be a mine because five people who don\u2019t pay a payroll don\u2019t want a mine?'\u201d",
      "In March 2023, Panama\u2019s Congress reached an agreement with Canadian mining company First Quantum, allowing its local subsidiary Panama Copper to continue operating the mine for at least 20 more years. The open-pit mine was temporarily closed in 2022 when talks between the government and First Quantum broke down over payments the government wanted.",
      "The contract, given final approval Oct. 20, 2023, allowed the subsidiary to continue operating the mine in a biodiverse jungle on the Atlantic coast west of the capital for the next 20 years, with the possibility of extending for a further 20 years if the site remained productive.",
      "The deal faced opposition from those who believed Panama wasn\u2019t getting as much as it should and from environmentalists and Indigenous groups who raised concerns about the mine\u2019s impact.",
      "The dispute led to some of Panama\u2019s most widespread protests in recent years, including a blockade of the mine\u2019s power plant. Protesters also blocked parts of the Pan American highway, including a stretch near the border with Costa Rica.",
      "On Nov. 28, 2023, Panama\u2019s Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the 20-year concession was unconstitutional and then-President Laurentino Cortizo announced the start of a process to close the mine.",
      "Days before the court\u2019s ruling, the Congress had also passed a moratorium on metal mining in Panama.",
      "The road to Cobre Panam\u00e1 now is peppered with signs calling for its reopening. At its peak, it had employed more than 7,000 people, of which only about 1,000 remain as the company tries to keep the surrounding jungle at bay and the equipment from rusting away.",
      "Edgardo D\u00edaz, who sold food to mine workers, said many vendors had to shutter their businesses when the mine stopped operating. He said he was one of five vendors who met with Mulino several weeks ago. \u201cWe asked that the mine be reopened.\u201d",
      "But not everyone agrees. Abelisario Rodr\u00edguez, a resident of R\u00edo Caimito near the mine, said that despite the mine\u2019s presence and the money it generated, his community still lacked basic services like electricity, drinking water, a health center and school.",
      "He said there had been a lot of promises made about the development the mine would bring, but he didn\u2019t see it reflected in his community and he didn\u2019t want to see it reopened.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want mines in Panama because we\u2019ve seen the experiences of countries like Chile, Peru, mining countries, communities that have been razed, that have been contaminated with sick populations,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that for our future generations.\u201d",
      "Manuel Aizpurua, head of Cobre Panam\u00e1, said they\u2019ve started bringing people to the mine to show the condition of the equipment and the need to make a decision on the mine\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cNature is attacking these installations and this equipment, taking them to a degree of deterioration where it won\u2019t be possible to restart the mine if we don\u2019t do something urgently,\u201d Aizpurua said.",
      "\u201cWe understand that an operation like this must generate significant benefits for the country and the surrounding communities, not only for our shareholders and investors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to sit down with the national government as soon as possible without preconditions to find a solution to achieve that objective.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Mulino made his comments about the mine Thursday, the 40-organization coalition Panama is Worth More without Mining gathered in the capital.",
      "Lilian Gonz\u00e1les Guevara, executive director of the nongovernmental Environmental Incident Center, pushed back against the economic argument for reopening the mine. She said that while many countries had struggled economically recently, Panama had grown even without the mine operating last year.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t depended on mining, it\u2019s a fallacy,\u201d she said. The only dialogue the group was open to having was about permanently closing the mine.",
      "The coalition has called for a public vigil Sunday to remind authorities of the public\u2019s opposition to the mine.",

      "Influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate are en route from the U.S. to Romania, where they face charges of human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate were en route Friday from the U.S. to Romania, where they face charges of human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.",
      "The Tates, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, were arrested in Romania in late 2022 and formally indicted last year on charges that they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania, where they were allegedly sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny all of the allegations against them.",
      "In a post on his X social media account Friday, Andrew Tate said: \u201cSpending 185,000 dollars on a private jet across the Atlantic to sign one single piece of paper in Romania. Innocent men don\u2019t run. THEY CLEAR THEIR NAME IN COURT.\u201d",
      "Their return to Romania comes nearly a month after a travel ban imposed on the brothers was lifted, after which they flew on a private jet to the U.S., landing in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.",
      "The brothers remain under judicial control, which requires them to appear before judicial authorities in Romania when summoned. Eugen Vidineac, one of the Tate brothers\u2019 lawyers in Romania, told The Associated Press that the Tates are due to check in with a surveillance officer on Monday.",
      "The Tate brothers are expected to issue press statements around 1 a.m. local time (2300 GMT) outside their residence near the capital, Bucharest, according to their spokesperson Mateea Petrescu.",
      "Days after the Tates arrived in the U.S., on March 4, Florida\u2019s Attorney General James Uthmeier said his office had opened a criminal investigation into Andrew and Tristan Tate. He said in a social media post that he directed his office to work with law enforcement to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the brothers.",
      "A day after the investigation was opened, Andrew Tate said in a post on X: \u201cI didn\u2019t commit any crime and they\u2019re trying to find one because they don\u2019t like me.\"",
      "The lifting of their two-year travel ban came after a Bucharest court in December ruled that a case against the brothers could not go to trial because of multiple legal and procedural irregularities on the part of the prosecutors. The case, however, remained open.",
      "Last August, Romania\u2019s anti-organized crime agency DIICOT also launched a second case against the brothers, investigating allegations of human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor, influencing statements and money laundering. They have denied those charges as well.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and that there is a political conspiracy to silence him.",
      "The Tate brothers\u2019 legal battles are not limited to Romania.",
      "Four British women who accused Andrew Tate of sexual violence and physical abuse are suing him in the U.K. after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him.",
      "In March last year, the Tate brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to the period from 2012 to 2015.",
      "The appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite the Tates, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.",

      "ISTANBUL -- The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition on Friday renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the appeal as irresponsible.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.",
      "Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported that police began questioning Imamoglu on Friday afternoon. The mayor can be detained without charges for up to four days.",
      "Erdogan said that the government wouldn't tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of being associated with corruption, marginal groups and terrorist organizations.",
      "\u201cWe see that an anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "\u201cPointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cJust as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.\u201d",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for nighttime rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, Turkish capital Ankara and Turkey\u2019s third-largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said that rubber bullets were used, but the government has denied that.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that more than 50 people were detained, and 16 police officers were injured, following the protests.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate, but said that street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a new appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor,\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ozel announced that the CHP has decided to hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart an alleged attempt by the authorities to appoint a \u201ctrustee chairman\u201d to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that the authorities may be seeking to annul the party\u2019s last congress held in 2023 over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader.",

      "BERLIN -- The prospective next German government's plans to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict debt rules and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that's aimed at boosting Europe's biggest economy cleared their final parliamentary hurdle Friday with approval by the upper house.",
      "The chamber, which represents Germany's 16 state governments, approved the measure proposed by likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz with the necessary two-thirds majority. Its endorsement followed approval on Tuesday by the lower house.",
      "Conservative leader Merz, who won last month's election, and his prospective center-left coalition partners say recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany\u2019s long-neglected military, as doubts have grown about the United States' commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The plans needed a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament because they involve changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the would-be coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes were needed to get enough support.",
      "The package exempts from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP.

      "About two dozen protesters had gathered outside a Tesla dealership in Surrey, British Columbia, on Sunday, the day after a similar protest in Vancouver, holding signs with messages including \u201celbows up,\u201d \u201cElon be-gone\u201d and \u201cdemocracy dies in apathy.\u201d",
      "Pat McCutcheon, who attended the Surrey protest, said in an interview on Tuesday that the organizers of the auto show did the right thing by removing Tesla.",
      "\u201cGiven the temperature of the situation, there are people, unfortunately, out there that are very annoyed with the Tesla situation and the Elon Musk situation,\u201d said McCutcheon.",

      "Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,\u201d Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said.",
      "Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThe biggest issue is we\u2019re not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,\u201d Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy.",
      "The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of \u201cspread pricing\u201d where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies.",
      "Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.",
      "Helena Duncan, president of the Business Council of Alabama, told a legislative committee on Wednesday that small businesses, which might already be struggling to provide insurance to their workers, will have to either absorb the increased cost or pass it along to employees through premium increases.",
      "\u201cShifting the financial burdens from pharmacies to the Alabama employers is fundamentally unfair,\u201d Duncan told a legislative committee on Wednesday.",
      "Republican Sen. Andrew Jones, a cosponsor of the bill, said Thursday said other states have seen drug prices go down. Jones said it is important to protect neighborhood pharmacies because they play a vital role in communities.",
      "\u201cYou are not going to get a big box store to open in the middle of the night to get you the medication you need,\u201d Jones said.",

The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who did not receive one or more Economic Impact Payments (EIP), also known as stimulus payments.",

      "The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who didn\u2019t receive the Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus payments, during 2020 and 2021. A refundable tax credit is a credit you can get as a refund even if you don\u2019t owe any tax.",
      "The IRS announced this initiative after reviewing its internal data and finding that many eligible taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return didn\u2019t claim the credit.",
      "\u201cTo minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we\u2019re making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it,\u201d said Werfel.",
      "If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you don\u2019t have to take any action. The IRS plans to send letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January. They\u2019ll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer\u2019s 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.",
      "You still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS.",
      "There were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents.",
      "In March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\u201d Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \u201cNone of those factors are lost on us.\u201d",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",

      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.",
      "Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen.

      "\u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d",

      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle\u2019s new stigma, and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,\u201d or \u201cI just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\u201d",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla\u2019s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of the administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump's political interests.

      "Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors seeking to convert to new, lower-carbon emission systems say they are finding federal funding they were counting on for the work is frozen or unavailable in the wake of sweeping budget cuts t...",
      "BREMEN, Maine -- Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors looking to switch to new, lower-carbon emission systems say the federal funding they relied on for this work is either frozen or unavailable due to significant budget cuts promoted by President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The changes are designed to replace old diesel-burning engines and outdated at-sea cooling systems and are touted by environmentalists as a way to reduce seafood's carbon footprint. Salmon harvesters in Washington state, scallop distributors in Maine and halibut fishermen in Alaska are among those who told The Associated Press their federal commitments for projects like new boat engines and refrigeration systems have been rescinded or are under review.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty. This is not a business-friendly environment,\u201d said Togue Brawn, a Maine seafood distributor who said she is out tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIf they want to make America great again, then honor your word and tell people what's going on.\"",
      "Decarbonization of the fishing fleet has been a target of environmental activists in recent years. One study published in the  Marine Policy journal states that more than 200 million tons of carbon dioxide were released via fishing in 2016.",
      "That is far less than agriculture, but still a significant piece of the worldwide emissions puzzle. With Earth experiencing worsening storms and its hottest year on record in 2024, reducing the burning of fossil fuels across different industry sectors is critical to fighting climate change, scientists have said.",
      "But climate-friendly projects often cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, leading fishermen to seek U.S. Department of Agriculture or Environmental Protection Agency funds to cover some costs. DOGE, a commission assembled to cut federal spending, has targeted both agencies for cutbacks.",
      "That has left fishermen like Robert Buchmayr of Seattle on the hook for huge bills. Buchmayr said he is nearing completion of a refrigeration project for a salmon boat and was counting on a $45,000 USDA grant to pay for a chunk of it. The agency told him last month the funding is on hold until further notice, he said.",
      "\u201cI'm scrambling, where does the money come from. I was counting on the grant,\u201d Buchmayr said. \u201cI was under the impression that if you got a grant from the United States, it was a commitment. Nothing in the letter was saying, 'Yes, we'll guarantee you the funds depending on who is elected.'\u201d",
      "The full extent of the cuts is unclear, and fishermen affected by them described the situation as chaotic and confusing.",
      "Representatives for the USDA and EPA did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press about the value of the cuts and whether they were permanent. Dan Smith, USDA Rural Development's state energy director for Alaska, said updates about some grants could arrive in April.",
      "Numerous fishermen, commercial fishing groups and advocates for working waterfronts told The Associated Press they learned about the changed status of their grant money in February and March. Some were told the money would not be coming and others were told the funds were frozen while they were subject to a review.",
      "Many prospective grant recipients said they have had difficulty getting updates from the agencies. The lack of certainty has fishermen worried and seeking answers, said Sarah Schumann, a Rhode Island fisherman and director of the Fishery Friendly Climate Action Campaign, a fishermen-led network that works on climate issues.",
      "\u201cThey've started contacting me in the last couple of weeks because they've had the plug pulled on money that was already committed,\u201d Schumann said. \u201cIf they miss a season they could go out of business.\u201d",
      "In Homer, Alaska, Lacey Velsko of Kaia Fisheries was excited for her decarbonization project, which she said hinged on hundreds of thousands of dollars via a USDA grant to improve a refrigeration system on one of her boats. The recently completed project burns less fuel and yields a higher quality project for the company, which fishes for halibut, Pacific cod and other fish, she said.",
      "But, now the company is told the money is unavailable, leaving a huge cost to bear, Velsko said.",
      "\u201cOf course we think it was unfair that we signed a contract and were told we would be funded and now we\u2019re not funded. If six months down the road we\u2019re still not funded I don\u2019t know what avenue to take,\u201d she said.",
      "The funding cuts have also hurt seafood processors and distributors, such as Brawn in Bremen, Maine. Brawn said she received a little more than half of a USDA grant of about $350,000 before learning the rest might not arrive.",
      "Brawn received the grant for Dayboat Blue, a project that uses a membership-based model to get Maine seafood to nationwide customers while reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and packaging.",
      "\u201cThis model can really help fishermen, it can help consumers, it can help communities,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cWhat it's going to do is it's going to stop the program.\u201d",
      "The confusion on the waterfront is another example of the bumpy rollout of government cutbacks under Trump. The Trump administration halted its firings of hundreds of federal employees who worked on nuclear weapons programs last month. It also moved to rehire medical device, food safety and other workers lost to mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration. New tariffs on key trading partners have also been chaotic.",
      "In Bellingham, Washington, EPA funding was paused for five engine replacement projects split between three companies, said Dan Tucker, executive director of the Working Waterfront Coalition of Whatcom County. He said the uncertainty about funding has made it difficult for fishermen to move ahead with projects that will ultimately benefit their businesses and the community at large.",
      "\u201cA lot of the small guys are like, 'Well, I really want to help out with climate change but I can't afford it,'\u201d Tucker said.",

    "story": [
      "A hair loss drug that first gained popularity in the 1990s is seeing a resurgence of interest",
      "WASHINGTON -- The latest trend in treating hair loss may sound familiar \u2014 essentially, it's a repurposed drug first popularized in the 1990s.",
      "Back then, TV viewers were inundated with ads for Rogaine, a sticky topical solution that could help treat thinning hair when applied to the scalp.",
      "Now dermatologists are increasingly prescribing the drug, known generically as minoxidil, in low-dose pills to help men and women maintain or regrow hair.",
      "The practice follows a handful of recent studies suggesting the ingredient works as well \u2014 and possibly better \u2014 when swallowed, rather than applied to hair follicles on the head. Telehealth companies are also driving new demand by offering a quick, easy way to get a prescription and have the pills shipped directly to customers' doors.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the drug:",
      "Minoxidil was originally developed as a pill to treat high blood pressure in the 1970s. Researchers noticed that some patients taking it experienced increased hair growth as a side effect.",
      "Rogaine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1988, the first drug to win the agency\u2019s endorsement for male pattern baldness. Studies showed that men on the medication, which was applied directly to the scalp, had a slower rate of hair loss and, in some cases, regrew hair.",
      "Starting in 1991, a lower dose was approved for women and the brand was aggressively marketed as an over-the-counter medication on TV and in print.",
      "The drug\u2019s ability to slow hair loss is likely related to its effect on blood circulation, according to experts.",
      "\u201cBy increasing blood flow to the scalp it signals hairs to stay in their grow phase for longer,\u201d said Dr. Adam Friedman, chair of dermatology at George Washington University. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep those hairs in that growth phase as long as possible.\u201d",
      "A recent consensus paper by more than 40 U.S. and international dermatologists concluded that minoxidil pills are effective and often more convenient and affordable than the liquid formulation.",
      "There's little research comparing the two forms of minoxidil, but many dermatologists believe the drug works better as a pill.",
      "At a chemical level, minoxidil is absorbed more directly when digested in the gut than when applied to the hairline. It\u2019s also more convenient, with patients taking the drug by mouth once a day, instead of applying the liquid once or twice daily using a dropper.",
      "\u201cAs you can imagine, that can be rather onerous,\u201d said Dr. Susan Taylor of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAlthough people often enthusiastically begin therapy\u2014 and even see results \u2014 after a while there are many who drop off.\u201d",
      "The doses prescribed for oral use are also very low. Dermatologists often direct men to take one half of the lowest-dose pill; women may only need a quarter of a pill.",
      "Those low doses can also reduce the chances for side effects, which can include dizziness, rapid heartbeat and swollen legs. The drug isn\u2019t recommended for people with a history of heart issues or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
      "The only other FDA-approved medication for hair loss is finasteride, sold under the brand name Propecia, a drug that blocks a byproduct of testosterone that triggers hair loss in men. That drug is generally considered more effective than minoxidil, but it can occasionally cause troubling sexual side effects, including erectile dysfunction. For optimal results, some dermatologists prescribe the two drugs in combination.",
      "In short, because there\u2019s very little money to be made.",
      "Minoxidil's patent has expired and it is now available as a low-cost generic medication. That means drugmakers have little financial incentive to spend millions on the new studies that would be needed to win FDA approval for hair loss.",
      "\u201cFor a drug like oral minoxidil \u2014 which is as old as dirt at this point \u2014 there are no reasons to do that,\u201d said Friedman. Like other dermatologists, Friedman gives hair-loss patients a prescription for the pills intended to treat blood pressure, a practice known as off-label prescribing.",
      "The upside for patients is that minoxidil is extremely affordable, with some pharmacies offering a month\u2019s supply for less than $5.",
      "\u201cNot a single patient has complained to me about the cost of this medication, which is extremely rare,\u201d said Dr. Luiz Garza of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The vast majority of doctors prescribing minoxidil for hair loss are dermatologists, who often turn to older drugs off-label for various hair and skin conditions.",
      "A survey of U.S. dermatologists published last year found 80% reported prescribing oral minoxidil. But with only about 12,000 dermatologists in the U.S., some patients may have trouble finding a provider.",
      "Telehealth providers like Hims and Ro say they are helping fill the gap. The companies' business model offers patients quick access to the medications they are seeking, often after simply filling out a questionnaire about their medical history, medications and treatment goals. The information is reviewed by a health provider who can quickly approve a prescription, assuming there are no red flags.",
      "Hims and Ro each say that their providers won't prescribe minoxidil for patients who have complicating health conditions or prescriptions that could negatively interact with the drug. In some cases, patients may be referred for an office visit.",
      "Many dermatologists say patients are better served by an in-person appointment, where a doctor will usually take a blood pressure reading, evaluate medical history, prescriptions and discuss the drug's side effects.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a proponent of going to an online service,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI recommend seeing your board-certified dermatologist who\u2019s trained, who knows the data and can evaluate all of you.\u201d",

      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced an agreement on a state budget framework with the state's Democratic leadership Thursday, criticizing President Donald Trump's tariffs and dramatic downsizing of the federal government while announcing tax increases and cuts to address a $3.3 billion state deficit for the next fiscal year.",
      "The tax increases include a new 3% tax on information technology services, as well as a new income tax bracket for the state's wealthiest residents",
      "\u201cWe \u2019ve spoken to Marylanders at all income levels about this plan, and there is consensus that if a person is making over $750,000 a year, it is reasonable to ask them to give roughly $1,800 more to help us invest in the success of our state,\" Moore, a Democrat, said.",

      "But the governor emphasized that 94% of Marylanders \u201cwill either get a tax cut or see no change in their income taxes.\u201d However, he did not provide an estimated average tax cut for those seeing reductions, saying work was ongoing to determine those numbers.",
      "Moore and other leading Democrats, who heavily control the state's legislature, described the budget plan as a much-needed modernization of the state's revenue streams.",
      "\u201cAs our economy increasingly becomes digital, this revenue expansion acknowledges the growing role of IT in our daily lives and business operations and the use of technology to replace workers,\" Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said. \"It also acknowledges that many goods, such as software programs, are now sold as yearly or monthly services.\u201d",
      "The new tax would apply to services like website building, as well as services that help people store information on the cloud, such as Amazon Web Services.",
      "Ferguson said the new tax on capital gains will be used to invest in transportation and help add a new revenue stream to the budget, and he linked the new tax to Trump's plan for a tax cut for the wealthy.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the Trump tax cuts that are focused on billionaires are likely to help those who have done the best, and so this is the right place for Maryland to look to have sustainable investment in our infrastructure and in our budget,\" Ferguson said.",
      "The plan includes about $2.3 billion in cuts, about $500 million more than the governor included in his initial budget proposal in January. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, noted that previous cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration have been restored.",
      "Moore described the cuts as the most significant in 16 years, but few details about them were offered at the news conference, an omission sharply criticized by Republicans.",
      "Del. Jason Buckel, a western Maryland Republican and the House minority leader, described it as \u201cvery disappointing, the incredible lack of detail.\u201d",
      "\u201cBasically all I took away from it was we\u2019re going to increase people\u2019s taxes,\" Buckel said. \"We\u2019re making cuts. We can\u2019t tell you what the cuts are.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers still have to pass a balanced budget before the end of the legislative session on April 7. The governor described the agreement on Thursday as a framework on its main components, though work remains in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cThis framework will inform the final budget and the final bill that goes from the House to the Senate, and I look forward to signing it when it makes it to my desk,\" Moore said.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that a vow by Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin not to attack energy infrastructure was \u201cvery much at odds with reality\u201d following an overnight barrage of drone strikes across the country.",
      "Zelenskyy said that he would speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later in the day and expected to hear more about the American leader's phone call with Putin about a ceasefire and to discuss the next steps to be taken.",
      "\u201cEven last night, after Putin\u2019s conversation with ... Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,\u201d Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb.",
      "Russia said it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking equipment near one of its pipelines.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "Russian strikes, which hit civilian areas and damaged a hospital, followed Putin's refusal to back a full 30-day ceasefire during discussions with Trump.",
      "The White House described the call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a \u201cmovement to peace\u201d that Washington hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting.",
      "But there was no indication that Putin backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.",
      "Stubb called the discussions between Putin and Trump a step in the right direction, but Finland's president said that Russia needs to end its aggression.",
      "\u201cThere are only two ways to respond to the proposal of the president of the United States: it\u2019s a yes or a no \u2014 no buts, no conditions,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cUkraine accepted a ceasefire without any forms of conditions. If Russia refuses to agree, we need to increase our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and ratchet up pressure on Russia to convince them to come to the negotiating table.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.",
      "Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including a direct drone strike on a hospital in Sumy and attacks on cities in Donetsk region. Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said that the military complied with Putin\u2019s order to halt energy infrastructure strikes and downed seven drones its forces fired before the order at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine\u2019s southern Mykolaiv region.",
      "Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said that three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Zelenskyy said that \u201cwords of a ceasefire\u201d weren't enough.",
      "\u201cIf the Russians don\u2019t hit our facilities, we definitely won\u2019t hit theirs,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "Russia said that its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions \u2014 the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula.",
      "Zelenskyy said that one of the most difficult issues in future negotiations would be the issue of territorial concessions.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid have defunded groups that campaign for LGBTQ+ communities and for democracy around the world",
      "In early 2024, Matthew Hart took a hard look at the upcoming elections around the world and worried that the outcomes did not look promising.",
      "\u201cWhat we knew was that the winds were not in our favor. The winds were not in our sail, and we saw all around the world a kind of moral panic,\u201d said Hart, executive director of the Global Philanthropy Project, a network of funders for LGBTQ+ people internationally.",
      "Rising authoritarianism and religiously motivated political movements were mixing into a \u201ctoxic blend\" that regularly targets trans, intersex and gay people, they said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Hart was among the philanthropic leaders who tried to prepare for not just changes under the Trump administration, but growing trends toward autocracy and crackdowns on human rights around the world.",
      "As a result, last year, Global Philanthropy Project quietly launched a campaign called \u201cFund Our Futures\u201d to raise money for LGBTQ+ organizations around the world. In November, they announced they had secured more than $100 million and have since raised the bar to try to bring in another $50 million. Donors will award the funds over the next three to five years and GPP will track their commitments.",
      "While few anticipated the speed and breadth of the Trump administration's policy changes, Hart had seen funders grapple with fear and paralysis in moments of crisis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a history in philanthropy that that you sort of wait and see. What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe thought, \u2019Oh, we have got to get ahead of this. Because if we don\u2019t secure the commitments now, we\u2019re talking two years of internal, philanthropic field work that would need to be done.\u201d",
      "Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, said the early preparation will allow funders to identify and support organizations aligned with their goals. But he said, no funder can expect to always be accurate in their forecasting.",
      "\u201cPreparation is really important,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd then also, so is being responsive when the context looks different than what you prepared for.\u201d",
      "For example, few funders contemplated the wholesale termination of most U.S. foreign aid, which has had vast and cascading effects on organizations across every geography and issue. Trump singled out foundations with large endowments for investigation in one of his executive orders on diversity, equity and inclusion and in a memo in February, he accused many nonprofits who have received federal funding of engaging \u201cin actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Funders who support democracy movements in inhospitable environments have some experience adapting to these kinds of threats. Even so, Kellea Miller, executive director of the Human Rights Funders Network, said they were caught off guard.",
      "\u201cThere are areas that Trump has very quickly shifted that we knew he would touch, but the scale and rapidity of it is beyond what most of us had imagined,\u201d she said, adding that she had expected more action from Congress.",
      "Starting in 2021, HRFN convened funders to coordinate their responses to crises like the presidential assassination Haiti and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Those conversations grew into a framework called Better Preparedness, which encourages foundations to consider in advance of a crisis how they want to react.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re not all funding the same groups and that we\u2019re also able to distribute the risk and risk appetite in a way that we can\u2019t if we\u2019re not honest and and working together,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Miller said now in the U.S., funders of democracy and human rights movements worry the Trump administration will threaten their ability to operate.",
      "\u201cA lot of foundations are very, very cautious right now because they\u2019re worried that their assets could be frozen. They\u2019re concerned that they will be targeted politically,\u201d she said.",
      "The commitments to the Fund Our Futures campaign represent a noticeable portion of the funding for groups that serve gay, transgender and intersex people around the world even as some government funding has been taken away.",
      "In 2021-2022, private philanthropy and donor governments together gave $905 million to these groups, according to the most recent research by GPP.",
      "Of that total, 20 foundations alone gave $522 million, or around 50% of the total, highlighting the importance of these private donations to supporting international LGBTQ+ communities. Sixteen governments and multilateral donors gave $175 million to LGBTQ+ groups, with the largest funder being the Netherlands.",
      "As part of its dramatic reduction in U.S. foreign aid, the Trump administration has also ended its policy of supporting the rights of LGBTQ+ people abroad, which the Biden administration had made a priority. In an exit memo from January, USAID staff under Biden wrote that the agency increased funding for programs for LBGTQ+ communities abroad from $6 million in 2021 to $25 million in 2024.",
      "The Netherlands and another major funder of LGBTQ+ communities, Sweden, both recently announced cuts to their foreign assistance. Canada, which is another major funder, has so far not changed their commitments.",
      "Even with the new resources in the pipeline, the cuts from government funders have significantly disrupted groups that serve LGBTQ+ communities, Hart said. In their view, every philanthropic dollar they can raise will help save the lives of trans, intersex and gay people around the world, who will be under greater attack as support for democracy more broadly falters.",
      "\u201cGender justice, feminist movements, freedom of movement and LGBTI people are all being attacked at the same time,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThat is a fundamental disruption to some of the core tenets of how modern democracy was proposed to function.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The Bank of England kept its main U.K. interest rate unchanged at 4.50% on Thursday even though the economy is barely growing and the nation faces more uncertainty in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration in the U.S.",
      "The decision by the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee was widely expected, and comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged.",
      "Minutes from the meeting showed that eight members voted to keep policy unchanged, with one backing a quarter-point reduction.",
      "The rate-setting panel has reduced the Bank of England\u2019s main rate from a 16-year high of 5.25% by a quarter of a percentage on three occasions since last August, most recently in February, after inflation fell from the multi-decade highs of over 10% reached in the wake of the sharp spike in energy prices following Russia's full-blown invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 .",
      "However, inflation, at 3%, remains above the bank\u2019s 2% target and is set to push higher in coming months, even without accounting for any tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Many economists think it could rise as high as 4% in the coming months as businesses are raise prices as a result of a big increase in the minimum wage and higher payroll taxes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment,\" said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. \u201cWe still think that interest rates are on a gradually declining path, but we\u2019ve held them at 4.5% today.\u201d",
      "If policymakers continue to pursue their recent gradual approach, then another cut is likely in May, when they will be armed with the bank\u2019s latest economic projections and Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey next holds a press conference.",
      "Bailey said rate-setters will be \u201clooking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving\u201d and that whatever happens, \"it\u2019s our job to make sure that inflation stays low and stable.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Federal Reserve, which kept borrowing rates unchanged Wednesday, also expressed uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies, which economists worry would lower global growth and lead to an uptick in prices.",
      "The British economy, the sixth-largest, eked out modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter, a hugely disappointing outcome for the new Labour government, which has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the British economy\u2019s growth performance has been notably below its long-run average.",
      "Critics say Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is partly responsible for the gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses.",
      "Reeves, who on March 26 will deliver a keenly-watched statement on the state of the public finances to lawmakers, will be hoping that the Bank of England does cut borrowing rates further over coming months as it will likely help shore up growth.",
      "Economists said the latest update from the bank did little to clear up the outlook, though most said a further quarter-point reduction in May remained on the cards.",
      "\u201cBut beyond that, much will depend on trade policy out of the U.S. and the fiscal announcements coming from the Chancellor,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",

      "Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing\u2019s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing\u2019s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing.",
      "Over the past week, Beijing's Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal by Hutchison, which is controlled by Li\u2019s family.",
      "That raises questions about the deal and highlights the difficulties Hong Kong businesses face as they balance demands from Beijing for national loyalty and their own capitalist interests in the once free-wheeling Asian financial hub. Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cSuperman,\u201d Li is among the world\u2019s 50 richest people, with Forbes calculating his net worth at $38 billion. Li, 96, retired from his position as chairman of CK Hutchison in 2018, succeeded by his elder son Victor. But he's still one of Hong Kong's most influential figures.",
      "Li's rags-to-riches story paralleled the former British colony\u2019s rise. His business empire touches almost every aspect of daily life in Hong Kong, from properties and supermarkets to telecommunications and utilities. Globally, his conglomerate owns assets including British drugstore chain Superdrug and European mobile phone network operator Three.",
      "A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. That was one reason U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane's operations.",
      "Li\u2019s influence extends beyond business. He has met with top Chinese leaders and has served on the elite committee that selected Hong Kong\u2019s leader.",
      "Experts on ties between Beijing and Hong Kong said ruling Communist Party leaders once understood that support from the business sector was crucial for maintaining Hong Kong\u2019s capitalist system. It's has been strategically vital for mainland China\u2019s economy, given the role their global networks and resources play in the country\u2019s development. So, Li has had notable political influence.",
      "But Li has faced criticism over some business decisions. When he sold off some mainland Chinese assets in 2015, an article published by a think tank affiliated with Chinese official news agency Xinhua accused him of being immoral.",
      "During pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li was blasted by some pro-Beijing supporters for his perceived ambivalence about the unrest. Some other Hong Kong business leaders adopted a harsher stance.",
      "CK Hutchison announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, which is chaired by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li\u2019s.",
      "If approved, the deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. The transaction does not include ports in Hong Kong or mainland China. CK Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial in nature.",
      "The deal pleased Trump but angered Beijing.",
      "One of the Beijing-backed newspaper commentaries described the deal as a betrayal of all Chinese and said the company should think about which side to take. The other said great entrepreneurs are patriots, suggesting that businesspeople who \u201cdance with\u201d predatory American politicians would be doomed to infamy.",
      "Comments on popular posts about the deal on Chinese social media platform Weibo tend to be more critical than favorable toward Li.",
      "Chief Executive John Lee avoided direct criticism of the deal or Trump, but told reporters on Tuesday his government opposes bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations, reiterating Beijing's stance.",
      "Some unconfirmed reports have suggested Chinese leaders were angry not to have been consulted in advance about the deal.",
      "George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm, said Beijing may have been disappointed because it had almost no time to devise a response in advance.",
      "Ports are valuable strategic assets and transactions involving them are always sensitive, said Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy.",
      "It is unclear whether pressure from Beijing will affect the deal, which has to be approved by Panama's government. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry deflected a question about whether authorities are investigating the deal, saying reporters should ask other authorities.",
      "CK Hutchison has not commented on the controversy. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it was not planning a news conference.",
      "Cancelling the deal would be risky, Chan said.",
      "\u201cStrictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m canceling the deal.\u2019 You can imagine what Trump\u2019s reaction would be,\u201d he said, adding that would also affect how the outside world views Hong Kong businesses.",
      "The first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for undermining the autonomy of the territory promised when Britain handed its colony to Beijing in 1997 under a concept dubbed \u201cOne country, two systems.\u201d It promised the city could keep its Western-style civil liberties and economic autonomy for at least 50 years, but following the 2019 protests, Beijing has doubled-down on its political control of the city.",
      "Li could try to placate critics who deem him insufficiently patriotic, Chan said, by using proceeds from selling the port assets for investments aligned with Beijing\u2019s policies, particularly in developing Hong Kong and mainland port businesses.",
      "But relations between private businesses and Beijing remain uncertain, said The Asia Group's Chen. Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met with private sector business leaders in a show of support, some may wonder if they must follow the party line even if that might conflict with their business interests, he said.",
      "If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals, he said.",
      "The situation shows that Washington\u2019s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid, Chen said.",
      "\u201cThis is bad when it comes to the defense of \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019\u201d Chen said.",

      "The removal of the references was first reported by the website cupofcoffeenews.com.",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, who launched a Diversity Pipeline Program in 2016, said following an owners meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, last month that MLB was evaluating the interpretation of law coming from the federal government.",
      "\u201cOur values, particularly our values on diversity, remain unchanged, but another value that is pretty important to us is we always try to comply with what the law is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere seems to be an evolution going on here.

      "\u201cBob was not only superior at his craft but he was also a terrific, humble and unselfish person that gave so much of himself to so many,\u201d said Kansas coach Bill Self, whose team was knocked out of the NCAA Tournament by Arkansas on Thursday.",
      "\u201cOur hearts go out to the entire family, especially with his wonderful wife Linda passing just last week.\u201d",
      "Davis began calling games for Kansas in 1984 and, until his retirement in 2016, was behind the microphone for some of its greatest moments. There was the 1988 national championship team dubbed \"Danny and the Miracles\" for its star, Danny Manning, that was led by Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown. And the national title team 20 years later, led by Self, that became known for \"Mario's Miracle\" \u2014 the tying 3-pointer by Mario Chalmers that forced overtime against Memphis in the finals.",
      "Davis covered eight trips by the Jayhawks to the Final Four, along with six bowl games in football and thousands of regular-season football and basketball games. Many were spent alongside Max Falkenstien, his predecessor and later his colleague and close friend, who spent 60 years broadcasting the Jayhawks before his retirement. Falkenstien died in 2019.",
      "\u201cBob Davis was a fantastic announcer and loved KU,\u201d said former Kansas and North Carolina coach Roy Williams. \u201cI was a new coach and he helped me immensely. He set the bar for all those I worked with later. He is a KU giant.\u201d",
      "Davis was born in Iola, Kansas, grew up in Topeka and attended Washburn University, where he earned a history degree. He got into broadcasting in 1968 when he was hired by a radio station in Hayes, calling American Legion baseball games and Fort Hays State athletics. Eventually, he got his breakthrough opportunity with the Jayhawks in 1984.",
      "Along with broadcasting Kansas, Davis called the women's Final Four for CBS six times, and he spent 16 years calling Royals games on radio and television. He was voted the Kansas Sportscaster of the Year on 14 occasions.",
      "\u201cFor 32 years, Bob captivated Jayhawk nation with his wit, voice and impeccable timing,\" said David Lawrence, his longtime partner on Kansas football broadcasts. \"While we will miss the physical presence of our friend, his iconic radio calls will still bring the goosebumps and live in our minds forever.\u201d",
      "Davis is survived by his son, Steven, daughter-in-law Katie and four grandchildren.",

      "CLEVELAND -- Earl Timberlake's toughness is no secret to his Bryant teammates.",
      "Facing Michigan State in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament late Friday night, Timberlake offered a glimpse of it to the rest of the college basketball world.",
      "The senior guard and American East Player of the Year took an elbow to the forehead from Spartans center Carson Cooper that left Timberlake's face awash in blood. He exited briefly before returning with a white bandage in place and finished with 14 points, five assists and four rebounds in his final college game.",

      "When Timberlake sat up, he could tell something was wrong.",
      "\u201cNext thing I know, I\u2019m leaking from my face,\u201d Timberlake said. \u201cAfter that, I\u2019m just thinking, 'How do I hurry up and get this thing taken care of so I can get back out there for my team?\u2019\u201d",
      "Timberlake, who averaged 15.5 points and a team-high 8.2 rebounds for the American East champions, missed about four minutes of game time while getting stitched up.",
      "Martelli, who led the Rhode Island school to its second-ever NCAA appearance in his second year as head coach, wasn't really sure what happened at first. When he saw Timberlake being tended to by trainers, he didn't waste a lot of time worrying if Timberlake was going to return.",
      "\u201cMy thought was, \u201c'He\u2019ll clean it up and be right back,'\u201d Martelli said. \u201dAnd he cleaned it up and he was right back. That\u2019s Earl Timberlake.\"",
      "Timberlake came back with just over 4 minutes to go in the first half and stayed on the floor until ultimately checking out for good with less than 3 minutes left and the game decided. He put a towel over his head and had an extended embrace with Bryant assistant coach Chris Cole to cap three years with the Bulldogs that helped him rediscover his passion for basketball.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know I was in a very dark place a couple years ago coming from different schools,\u201d said Timberlake, who played at Miami and Memphis before coming to Bryant. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to play basketball no more. I just thank them for helping me get the love back for the game.\u201d",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Cooper Flagg had long watched March Madness and imagined being a part of it.",
      "A sprained ankle suffered last week wasn't about to delay that dream for Duke's freshman star.",
      "\u201cI mean, this is something that I've dreamed about since I was 6, 7 years old, watching every single year with my family, my friends,\u201d Flagg said.",
      "In other words, there was no way he was going to sit out the top-seeded Blue Devils' first-round romp against 16-seed Mount St. Mary's on Friday, short of being on crutches, in a cast or unable to even stand on that left ankle. He had missed the past two games with the injury suffered during the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament but looked comfortable and unbothered in his NCAA Tournament debut.",
      "Flagg finished with 14 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks in 22 minutes of work, finishing a team-best plus-31 before getting an early end to the workday with victory in hand.",
      "\u201cHonestly for me, after watching the whole ACC Tournament, it was more of just like a plan to just be ready for this game, and we just put a plan in place,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cWe have phases, a strategy of just getting back, getting prepared, and being ready.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-9 Flagg is a potential No. 1 overall NBA draft pick and was selected unanimously as an Associated Press first-team All-American, blessed with an all-around game that can make him a game-changing threat as a scorer and playmaker.",
      "All at the age of 18.",
      "And the Blue Devils need him if they want to make good on a seasonlong quest to win their sixth national championship. So even though the Blue Devils were likely set for a blowout against an overmatched foe, there was still a lot riding on what Flagg could do on the court.",
      "The good news for Duke was that Flagg \u2014 greeted by loud cheers and a call of \u201cCooooooooop!\u201d during introductions \u2014 provided quick answers.",
      "His first basket came when he took a feed from Tyrese Proctor and banked it in on a drive while being fouled by Xavier Lipscomb, sending Flagg to the floor flat on his back. He landed with his fists clenched and his arms in a light flex that has become a go-to celebration move, then nodded as though getting the contact had welcomed him to the fight less than two minutes into the game.",
      "Minutes later, he made a backdoor cut to take Patrick Ngongba\u2019s feed for a dunk.",
      "\u201cI though he looked pretty good,\u201d freshman teammate Kon Knueppel said. \u201cHe was sharp.\u201d",
      "Flagg's every move was watched closely by home-state fans, his teammates and coach Jon Scheyer.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing for me was him not pacing, I didn't want him to pace,\u201d Scheyer said. \u201cThen obviously making sure he was moving, where he wasn't off-balance of favoring one leg or the other.\u201d",
      "Flagg checked out for the final time at the 10:53 mark with Duke up 32, then spent the final minutes hopping around, laughing and cheering on the reserves getting mop-up duty to close this one out.",
      "\u201cWe were ready for him to play more,\u201d Scheyer said. \u201cBut I think the way it worked out obviously was really good.\u201d",
      "Flagg got hurt when he rolled his ankle after having his foot clip the foot of a Georgia Tech player as he came down for a rebound in the ACC quarterfinals last Thursday. Flagg watched from the bench the rest of the tournament alongside versatile defender Maliq Brown, who went down with a shoulder injury moments before Flagg's injury.",
      "Still, Flagg was healthy enough to climb the ladder and snip a piece of net after Duke's title win last weekend.",
      "Scheyer said Flagg had spent time in a swimming pool using an underwater treadmill in the days after the injury. Flagg had said Thursday he was ready to go after building up more activity, which included returning to full practice Wednesday.",
      "That's why Flagg's anxiousness Friday had nothing to do with his ankle.",
      "\u201cI didn't have any doubts in my ankle at all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I definitely had some jitters. Like I said, this is something I've dreamed about since I was a little kid.\u201d",

      "The Bears put the focus on their size advantage to take control, getting the ball to Vonleh inside. The 6-foot-3 senior transfer from Colorado, who was also 5 of 7 on free throws, left to a loud ovation after fouling out in the final minute.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning of the game it was just hard to get touches because they were being so aggressive defensively,\u201d Vonleh said. \u201cBut I just made it an emphasis to keep posting hard knowing like it was going to open eventually, and my teammates eventually figured out how to get it to me successfully.\u201d",
      "Grand Canyon played the last 13 minutes of the first half without Trinity San Antonio after the team's leader picked up her second foul. She scored 23 of her 27 points after the break, including 14 in the third quarter, to help the Lopes stay close.",
      "The bigger Bears also shut down Grand Canyon's biggest 3-point threat, with Sarah Andrews leading the defensive effort to hold Alyssa Durazo-Frescas to her second game of the season without a bucket beyond the arc. She attempted just three after entering the tournament leading the country at four made 3s per game.",
      "\u201cThey tried to get her open,\u201d Collen said. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t going to leave her. So when you can make them go two by two by two and make San Antonio make pull-up jump shots, she\u2019s going to miss some. She made a lot them, but still missed some.\u201d",
      "The Lopes tried a zone after getting within two late in the third, but Vonleh found a seam, took the pass and converted the three-point play for a 47-42 lead.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s tough to guard,\u201d Grand Canyon coach Molly Miller said. \u201cWe tried to double some, pick-and-roll. Tried to hedge and tag and go back nose-to-nose if you will. She\u2019s just hard to handle.\u201d",
      "Darianna Littlepage-Buggs, the only player in the Big 12 to average a double-double, returned for Baylor after missing seven games with a right knee injury. She scored two points on a minutes restriction, finishing with 18.",
      "\u201cShe is just our energy player,\u201d said Yaya Felder, who scored 12 points. \u201cShe brings us up, so it was just a happy time with her back out there.\u201d",
      "San Antonio and Grand Canyon defensive stopper Tiarra Brown were part of a unique blend of a team with a 30-game winning streak making its NCAA Tournament debut.",

      "Since Jimmy Butler joined the Golden State Warriors at the trade deadline from Miami, he has brought an energy and winning mentality they were searching for to make a playoff push",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Jimmy Butler had places to be, and he loudly let everybody know it.",
      "He needed to immediately rush off from a game to teach a late-night dominoes lesson. But, not before he hit teammate Buddy Hield with some fun-loving trash talk: \u201cBuddy, spell connector.\u201d",
      "So, Hield began, \u201cConnect Four? Connector? ... Connector, C-O-N,\" then someone nearby interjected to help.",
      "\u201cAww, man, don't help him!\u201d Butler hollered. \u201cExactly my point, y'all see that?\u201d",
      "Shortly beforehand, Hield had described Butler with that very word \u2014 connector.",
      "Butler downplayed the compliment: \u201cDon't listen to nothing Buddy says, ever, he can't even spell connector.\u201d",
      "Yet nobody around the Warriors will argue that Butler has been just that since he joined Golden State last month in a trade from Miami and helped turn things around from the very moment he showed up and pulled on his new uniform.",
      "\u201cHe stabilized everything immediately,\u201d Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone said Monday when his team beat Golden State 114-105.",
      "Butler will be counted on even more as Stephen Curry recovers from a pelvic injury that he suffered on Thursday night. Curry will not play in the Warriors' game against the Hawks on Saturday.",
      "Any injury to Curry is a concern for Golden State, but Butler is thrilled to be part of the playoff push and playing alongside Curry and Draymond Green as they attempt to chase another championship.",
      "\u201cAll the value just lies within winning as a whole,\u201d Butler recently said. \u201cI'm glad that I have the opportunity to be a part of the winning that we're doing here. We're just playing some incredible basketball, playing together on both sides of the floor and it's really fun.\u201d",
      "He notched Golden State's first triple-double of the season March 10 against Portland, saying afterward, \u201cyou can't get a triple-double without your teammates.\u201d",
      "The Warriors won 14 of the first 15 games Butler played to boost their position in the deep Western Conference. They are 16-3 since acquiring Butler and Curry is impressed with how comfortable Butler became right away, finding his familiarity in a new system.",
      "\u201cNone of us are going to get off on regular-season accomplishments,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe have to perform and put ourselves in playoff position to be a team that nobody wants to face and be a tough out no matter who the matchup is. We're building toward that. It's pretty clear as day the difference in not just the record but how we're playing, how we're winning and his impact on the game.\u201d",
      "Curry admires Butler for being \u201csuper consistent, a professional, there\u2019s been a lot of eyeballs on him all season, pre-trade, post-trade and all that, but I love the way he\u2019s approached everything.\u201d",
      "So, how good is Butler's dominoes game?",
      "\u201cGreat, I'm probably the best in the world,\u201d the 35-year-old forward said, noting he plays \u201cevery day, too many hours out of the day.\u201d",
      "In addition to the fun they're all having behind the scenes, Butler's impact on both ends of the court has taken some of the pressure off Curry. The Warriors are rolling again and general manager Mike Dunleavy is being praised for taking the chance on a big trade \u2014 one that sent high-scoring Andrew Wiggins to South Florida.",
      "Butler will play at Miami on Tuesday night in his return with Golden State. He is pulling down timely offensive rebounds. He runs the point and creates shots for everybody, taking his own when he sees fit.",
      "\u201cGreat basketball player. He does everything well, he sees the game, he's strong, loves to pass, the game just flows when he's out there,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cAnd he feels it. Whatever the game calls for, Jimmy brings and he's the main reason that things have turned for us. He's one of the best players in the league and he makes everybody else around him better.\u201d",
      "In January, Butler was unhappy in Miami and seeking a change \u2014 \"I want to see me get my joy back from playing basketball, wherever that may be,\" he said \u2014 yearning to be a winner and make a difference.",
      "Butler found his fit way out West.",
      "\u201cHe affects winning, and winning affects everything else,\u201d guard Moses Moody said. \u201cWhen we're playing good it's a lot easier to be cool off the court. He is who he is. He has a big presence, he's authentic to himself, so he does do the candles, music, however he's feeling whatever it is. He definitely has a presence in the locker room. He's a real dude, and real dudes are contagious.\u201d",
      "And \u201cPlayoff Jimmy,\u201d as he has become known for his clutch performances on the postseason stage, is doing it all to boost Golden State's positioning in the stretch run.",
      "\u201cI think since Day 1 when Jimmy arrived in the bay he's been \u2018Playoff Jimmy.' He couldn't wait and they couldn't wait,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWhen you go to a new team and new surroundings and a new culture, he's come in from Day 1 and I think just been Jimmy Butler and the best version of Jimmy Butler.\"",
      "And Butler insists he hasn't changed anything competing alongside Curry and Green \u2014 he knew them plenty well already as an opponent.",
      "\u201cI play the same way, shoot the ball when I\u2019m open, pass it more often than not and play some defense,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s everything that I expected, everything that I could actually dream of, too, if we\u2019re being brutally honest. They just want to win, there ain\u2019t no individual goals here, they don\u2019t care who scores, they don\u2019t care who gets triple-doubles, they don\u2019t care about none of that. All they want to do is win a championship.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand.

      "Dozens of companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more",
      "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- From the grounds of a gas-fired power plant on the eastern shores of Canada, a little-known company is pumping a slurry of minerals into the ocean in the name of stopping climate change.",
      "Whether it\u2019s pollution or a silver bullet that will save the planet may depend on whom you ask.",
      "From shore, a pipe releases a mixture of water and magnesium oxide \u2014 a powdery white mineral used in everything from construction to heartburn pills that Planetary Technologies, based in Nova Scotia, is betting will absorb more planet-warming gases into the sea.",
      "\u201cRestore the climate. Heal the ocean,\u201d reads the motto stamped on a shipping container nearby.",
      "Planetary is part of a growing industry racing to engineer a solution to global warming using the absorbent power of the oceans. It is backed by $1 million from Elon Musk\u2019s foundation and competing for a prize of $50 million more.",
      "Dozens of other companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more. Nearly 50 field trials have taken place in the past four years, with startups raising hundreds of millions in early funds.",
      "But the field remains rife with debate over the consequences for the oceans if the strategies are deployed at large scale, and over the exact benefits for the climate. Critics say the efforts are moving too quickly and with too few guardrails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West. Everybody is on the bandwagon, everybody wants to do something,\u201d said Adina Paytan, who teaches earth and ocean science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.",
      "Planetary, like most of the ocean startups, is financing its work by selling carbon credits \u2014 or tokens representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the air. Largely unregulated and widely debated, carbon credits have become popular this century as a way for companies to purchase offsets rather than reduce emissions themselves. Most credits are priced at several hundred dollars apiece.",
      "The industry sold more than 340,000 marine carbon credits last year, up from just 2,000 credits four years ago, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi. But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",
      "Monetizing the work is uncomfortable for many who study the ocean.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s encouraging more research and more science, which is good. On the other hand, it\u2019s opening doors for abuse of the system,\u201d said Paytan, the Santa Cruz professor, who has been contacted by several startups asking to collaborate.",
      "She pointed to companies that are accused of drastically overestimating the carbon they sequestered, though they bragged of restoring rainforests in Peru and replacing smoke-producing stoves in Africa.",
      "But absent more government-funded research, several companies told AP there\u2019s little way for the field to advance without selling credits.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set things up now, is that we put it in the hands of these startups to develop the techniques,\u201d said Ho.",
      "Back in his shipping container office along Halifax Harbour, Burt said he understood the unease around selling credits, and said Planetary takes seriously the need to operate openly, responsibly and cautiously. But he also says there\u2019s a need for startups that can move at a faster pace than academia.",
      "\u201cWe cannot study this solution at the same rate that we\u2019ve been studying the problems,\u201d he said. He says there\u2019s not enough time.",
      "Last year marked the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, even as global carbon emissions are projected to reach another all-time high.",
      "\u201cWe need to reduce emissions urgently, drastically,\u201d said Fennel, the researcher studying Planetary\u2019s project. \u201cAny removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is much more difficult and costly than avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.\u201d",
      "The industry continues to push forward. Planetary said in February that it had sequestered a total of 1,000 metric tons of carbon in the ocean, and Carboniferous completed its first test of sinking sugarcane to the seafloor. Early this year, Gigablue signed a deal for 200,000 carbon credits for dispersing nutrient-filled particles in the ocean.",
      "A growing number of companies are also using electricity to alter seawater molecules, with the same goal of prompting the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. The startup Ebb Carbon recently struck a deal with Microsoft to provide up to 350,000 carbon credits, and Captura, which is funded in part by investors affiliated with oil and gas production, expanded its operations from California to Hawaii.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. government will stall or support ocean climate work going forward. The policy landscape continues to shift as the Trump administration seeks to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations and reconsider the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.",
      "Though White House adviser Musk has downplayed some of his past statements about global warming, four years ago his foundation committed $100 million to fund a competition for the best solution for carbon capture, of which Planetary is in the running for the top prize.",
      "The winner will be announced April 23 \u2014 the day after Earth Day.",

      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",
      "On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.",

      "Amazon is suing the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding the e-commerce giant legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon has sued the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding the e-commerce giant legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site.",
      "The independent federal agency ordered Amazon in January to take several actions, including notifying customers who bought more than 400,000 items covered by recalls and giving refunds to those who could prove the products were properly disposed of or destroyed.",
      "The order followed the commission's unanimous determination last summer that Amazon was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of faulty items sold on its website by third-party sellers and shipped through the company\u2019s fulfillment service",
      "But Amazon has long disputed it qualifies as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of products offered by other sellers. In its lawsuit filed on March 14, the company maintained it serves as a \u201cthird-party logistics provider\" and therefore should not be held liable for recalls of products that were made, owned and sold by others.",
      "The commission sued Amazon in 2021 for allegedly distributing hazardous items, accusing the company of putting consumer safety at risk by failing to properly notify the public about recalled products that included defective carbon monoxide detectors and flammable children\u2019s pajamas.",
      "Amazon said in its lawsuit that it issued previous recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns several years ago. The company argues the commission is an \u201cunconstitutionally structured agency\u201d that overstepped its authority with the new directive.",
      "\u201cThe remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The Seattle-based company said it could not comment further on its lawsuit filed last week.",
      "Amazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have active lawsuits challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board as unconstitutional. The two companies initiated the cases after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.",
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to comment Wednesday on Amazon's lawsuit complaint. In a Jan. 17 statement about the hazardous products order, Commissioner Richard L. Trumka Jr. said it was the CPSC's job to \u201chold companies like Amazon accountable\" and \u201cno company is above the law.\u201d",

      "An experimental treatment appears to postpone Alzheimer's symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease at a young age",
      "An experimental treatment appears to delay Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease in their 40s or 50s, according to new findings from ongoing research now caught up in Trump administration funding delays.",
      "The early results \u2014 a scientific first \u2014 were published Wednesday even as study participants worried that politics could cut their access to a possible lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a study but it has given me an extension to my life that I never banked on having,\u201d said Jake Heinrichs of New York City.",
      "Now 50, Heinrichs has been treated in that study for more than a decade and remains symptom-free despite inheriting an Alzheimer\u2019s-causing gene that killed his father and brother around the same age.",
      "If blocked funding stops Heinrichs\u2019 doses, \u201chow much time do we have?\u201d asked his wife, Rachel Chavkin. \u201cThis trial is life.\u201d",
      "Two drugs sold in the U.S. can modestly slow worsening of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing the brain of one of its hallmarks, a sticky gunk called amyloid. But until now, there haven't been hints that removing amyloid far earlier \u2013 many years before the first symptoms appear \u2013 just might postpone the disease.",
      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",
      "In New York, Heinrichs said he has hope that his 3-year-old son won\u2019t \u201cexperience the stress and sorrow that I lived through as a young man to watch my father fade away.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need the NIH to be not politicized,\u201d added Chavkin, his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s just about keeping people alive or helping them live better. And in this case, it\u2019s helping my husband survive.\u201d",

Koch is currently assigned to NASA\u2019s first Artemis crew, which will fly around the moon and back as early as next year.",
      "Russian Oleg Kononenko last year became the first person to crack 1,000 days in space over the course of a career. By the time he returned from the space station last fall, he'd logged an incredible 1,111 days aloft over five spaceflights \u2014 a combined total of more than three years. Former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson is America's most experienced space flier with 675 days over three long station stints and one short private trip for Axiom Space. She's due to lead another Axiom crew to the space station later this spring. Because of her delayed homecoming, Williams moved into the No. 2 spot with 608 days in space over three missions.",

      "States and cities across the country are grappling with how to stay on the right side of government transparency laws as the use of encrypted messaging apps becomes more widespread",
      "As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.",
      "One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.",
      "\u201cThat's what Signal was supposed to be for,\u201d then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.",
      "Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.",
      "While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.",
      "An Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.",
      "It's unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it \u2014 a county spokesperson did not respond to questions \u2014 but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?",
      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP's list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.",
      "Improper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.",
      "Public officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.",
      "Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren\u2019t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That\u2019s not against the law,\u201d said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. \u201cBut how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that \u201chighly valued targets\u201d \u2014 senior officials who handle sensitive information \u2014 use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.",
      "CISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.",
      "Journalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.",
      "While some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren\u2019t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They\u2019re trying to make sure it\u2019s secure,\u201d Mamac said. \u201cI think that they are really trying to figure out, \u2018How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.",
      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

      "Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe\u2019s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\u201cIt's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. And other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency\u2019s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "\u201cWe want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\u201d at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what\u2019s called the Big Crunch. It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\u201cNow, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cWould we consider that a good or bad thing? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "IQALUIT, Nunavut -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada's far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region.",
      "The prime minister's office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201c\u201cCanada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",

And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d",
      "Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",
      "For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations.

      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.",

(AP) \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, they've captured the world's attention \u2014 and hearts \u2014 as NASA's stuck astronauts.",
      "Their homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. They'll fly back with SpaceX as soon as Tuesday, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit.",
      "Here's a look at \u201cSuni and Butch\u201d and their drama-filled mission:",
      "The two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.",
      "Wilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.",
      "NASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliner's first crew.",
      "While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore\u2019s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.",
      "Williams\u2019 husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.",
      "Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can\u2019t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.",
      "Wilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space station's internet phone.",
      "Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.",
      "Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they're back, according to NASA.",
      "\u201cEvery astronaut that launches into space, we teach them don't think about when you're coming home. Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",
      "SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that's been up there since last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,\u201d Bowersox said, describing the pair as \u201cprofessional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.\u201d",
      "Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing's Starliner and will return in SpaceX's Dragon.",
      "Their first flights were aboard NASA's space shuttle, followed by Russia's Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.",
      "As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Starliner almost didn't make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.",
      "NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.",
      "Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it's unclear when Starliner will fly again \u2014 with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy's sake and stand by that choice.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "Iguanas may have pulled off a 5000 mile voyage on a raft of floating vegetation to get to Fiji",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji, a collection of remote islands in the South Pacific. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas \u2014 thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.",
      "They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.",
      "But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas pulled off the 5,000 mile (8,000 kilometer) odyssey on a raft of floating vegetation \u2014 masses of uprooted trees and small plants. That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",
      "The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other tidbits about where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America.",
      "\u201cGiven what we know now, their result is by far the most strongly supported,\u201d said Kevin de Queiroz, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot.",
      "\u201cIf you had to pick a vertebrate to survive a long trip on a raft across an ocean, iguanas would be the one,\u201d said study author Simon Scarpetta from the University of San Francisco, in an email.",
      "Many Fijian iguana species are endangered, and an invasive green iguana roams the islands today, said study author Robert Fisher of the United States Geological Survey. Figuring out where these creatures came from can equip scientists with the tools to better protect them in the future.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "Early Friday morning, Trump posted on his social media platform: \"People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes funders. WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!\"",
      "He also suggested those found guilty of participating in Tesla-related crimes could be sent to prison in El Salvador, referring to the administration's controversial move to deport alleged gang members to the country after Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act even though a court order temporarily blocked the authority.",
      "\"I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,\" Trump said in a posting. \"Perhaps they would serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions.\"",

      "When asked about his comments at the White House on Friday afternoon, Trump called the vandalism suspects \"terrorists\" and appeared to argue what was happening with Tesla vehicles was worse than what happened during the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol.",
      "\"You didn't have that on January 6, I can tell you. You didn't have anything like that on January 6, which is sort of amazing,\" Trump said.",
      "Three people have been charged for their alleged involvement in recent attacks against Tesla properties in Salem, Oregon; Loveland, Colorado; and North Charleston, South Carolina. Adam Lansky of Salem was charged with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device on March 5, Lucy Grace Nelson of Lyons, Colorado, was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property on Feb. 27 and Daniel Clarke-Pounder of North Charleston was charged with arson on March 15, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Both Lansky and Clarke-Pounder have not entered any pleas, but Nelson pleaded not guilty on March 11, according to court records.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi also spoke out against the Tesla vandalisms, saying on Thursday the three suspects will face the \"full force of the law\" for allegedly using Molotov cocktails to set fire to the electric vehicles and charging stations.",

      "The Trump administration has cut funding to the program that provides legal representation to tens of thousands of unaccompanied migrant children, according to a memo issued Friday by the Interior Department, which handles contracts for the Office of Refugee Resettlement.",
      "According to the memo obtained by ABC News, organizations that collectively receive over $200 million in federal grants were told on Friday that the contract was partially terminated, ending the funding for legal representation and for the recruitment of attorneys to represent migrant children.",
      "The only funding that remains from the contract is for \"Know Your Rights\" informational presentations that are given to unaccompanied migrant children in detention centers.",
      "\"The government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience,\" the memo says. \"In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work.\"",

      "A representative for the Department of Heath and Human Services, which oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement, did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration issued a similar memo ordering organizations to immediately stop work on the $200 million contract -- but later rescinded the order.",

    "story": [
      "Judges have blocked his transgender military ban, funding freezes and more.",
      "In President Donald Trump's escalating battle with the judiciary, he and his Republican allies have zeroed in on a similar message.",
      "No single judge, they argue, should be able to use an injunction to block the powers of the country's elected chief executive.",
      "\"That's a presidential job. That's not for a local judge to be making that determination,\" Trump said on Fox News earlier this week as he railed against a judge who issued a limited order to stop deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to other countries after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, peppered with questions after the administration did not turn the planes around, on Wednesday preemptively offered her own rebuke of judges who've recently ordered injunctions taking effect nationwide.",
      "\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she said. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "The White House argues that's especially the case when it comes to immigration matters, foreign affairs, national security and the president exercising his constitutional powers as commander in chief.",
      "Judges have, so far, temporarily blocked Trump's efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military, freeze federal funding and bring an end to birthright citizenship.",
      "Supporters of nationwide injunctions say they serve as an essential check to potentially unlawful conduct and prevent widespread harm. Critics say they give too much authority to individual judges and incentivize plaintiffs to try to evade random assignment and file in jurisdictions with judges who may be sympathetic to their point of view.",
      "In general, legal experts told ABC News an injunction is meant to preserve the status quo while judges consider the merits of the case. (Judges also issue temporary restraining orders -- with similar impact -- as short-term emergency measures to prevent irreparable harm until a hearing can be held.)",
      "\"Often the nationwide injunction, or universal injunction, is put in place right at the start of a litigation,\" said Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.",
      "\"All of these can be appealed, and they are,\" Frost said. \"It's appealed to a three-judge court and then the Supreme Court after that. So, when people say one district court is controlling the law for the nation, well maybe for a few weeks. The system allows for appeals, and the Trump administration has appealed.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts said the same in a rare statement after Trump attacked the federal judge in the deportation flight case as a \"Radical Left Lunatic\" and called for him to be impeached.",
      "In fact, Trump was handed a win when an appeals court last week lifted an injunction on his executive orders seeking to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government.",
      "Nationwide injunctions are also not new, though scholars agree they've been used far more in recent decades.",
      "\"We saw them with Obama, we saw them with the first Trump administration, and saw them with Biden,\" Frost said. \"And now we're seeing them even more with President Trump but they go in lockstep with the sweeping executive orders that seek to change and upend vast swaths of our legal structure.\"",
      "According to a study by the Harvard Law Review, President Barack Obama faced 12 injunctions, the Trump administration faced 64 and President Joe Biden 14 injunctions.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have either urged the judiciary to rein in injunctions or celebrated their outcomes, depending on whether they align with their political goals.",
      "In 2023, when a federal judge in Missouri issued an injunction limiting contact between the Biden administration and social media sites, then-candidate Trump called it a \"historic ruling\" and the judge \"brilliant.\" The U.S. Supreme Court eventually sided with the Biden administration on the issue.",
      "Now, the Trump administration is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to curb injunctions after three different federal judges temporarily blocked the president's birthright citizenship order, saying it likely violated the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"At a minimum, the Court should stay the injunctions to the extent they prohibit agencies from developing and issuing public guidance regarding the implementation of the Order. Only this Court's intervention can prevent universal injunctions from becoming universally acceptable,\" Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in an application to the high court last week.",
      "Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said he understands the \"frustration\" that can stem from nationwide injunctions but ultimately \"judges are there to make sure that the government doesn't violate the Constitution.\"",
      "\"Trump is really taking a sledgehammer to everything government related,\" he said. \"These norms have been around for decades, so you have to allow some time for the courts, particularly the Supreme Court, to weigh in and say whether this is appropriate or not.\"",
      "The White House has said Trump will comply with the courts, but his intensifying rebukes of judges and rulings have raised the question: What happens if he doesn't?",
      "\"That would completely undermine the integrity of our system,\" Rahmani said.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "At one point, Hageman sparred with a woman who said she was a retired military officer and Republican, who grilled the congresswoman over the evidence of alleged fraud that Musk and Republicans contend they have uncovered.",
      "\"Just to give you a little reference, I'm a retired military officer,\" an unidentified woman said at one point in the town hall. \"At 18, I rose my hand to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. ... \"And my question, having looked at Musk's DOGE, you are a lawyer. Where is this fraud? Who? What company? What organization? What personnel are we going after right now?\"",
      "DOGE's actions have come under fire, not only for recommending thousands of federal workers be fired, including many veterans but allegations, backed by President Donald Trump and the White House pertaining to what they say is massive fraud in government spending. The claims of fraud, which Trump outlined in his recent address to Congress, are not yet verifiable.",
      "Hageman, fired back at the constituent, saying, \"Oh my gosh, I'll just start reading some of it. I'll just start reading it right now, if you like me to. I'll just focus on USAID spending right here.\"",
      "\"I didn't say spending, I said actual fraud,\" the woman shouted back at Hageman.",
      "\"This is what it is,\" Hageman retorted. \"This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud. Spending is the fraud.\"",
      "\"No, no, no,\" the woman shouted back. \"Go after specific companies or specific personnel that are committing fraud.\"",
      "\"This is fraud. This is fraudulent spending,\" said Hageman.",
      "\"No, it may be abusive spending, but it's not fraud,\" the woman replied.",
      "\"What I said was waste, fraud and abuse. Waste, fraud and abuse,\" Hageman said back, before trying to give figures on USAID spending.",
      "The same constituent then pressed Hageman over firings and whether or not they were actually making government more efficient: \"Just because you're firing somebody doesn't mean that's efficient because the job is still there. It still needs to be done,\" she said.",
      "\"We will eliminate some of those jobs as well,\" Hageman said. \"Those jobs will be being eliminated. They don't need to be done.\"",
      "At another point during the town hall, another woman pressed Hageman over what qualifies Musk to be making cuts to federal spending.",
      "\"You just described the cuts to the government right now as some kind of careful audit, but the cuts that DOGE has been making have been willy-nilly by someone who has never served in the government, has never run a nonprofit, who has 19-year-olds infiltrating computers and agencies and making decisions. So who is Musk accountable to? What qualifies him to be making these cuts? It's not an audit,\" she asked.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $115 billion but that full amount is unverifiable because there are only receipts for a portion of the claimed savings.",
      "\"As I said a moment ago, this is, it is an audit. It is the closest thing that we are ever going to get to zero-based budgeting in the federal government,\" Hageman said.",
      "\"What I cannot understand, whether he is a billionaire, a millionaire, or someone who is, just as he says, tech support, all he is doing is going in and looking at every single agency and how the money is being spent. Do you think that you are entitled to know how your money is being spent?\" she added.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:30:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The DNC brought in $9 million in grassroots fundraising during the critical first full month of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.",
    "story": [
      "The haul comes as the party remains divided on strategy and leadership.",
      "Democrats are settling into the year with some of their strongest February grassroots fundraising numbers on record, according to the Democratic National Committee, which says it brought in $9 million during the critical first full month of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency with an average donation of less than $35.",
      "In a memo obtained exclusively by ABC News, the DNC says the haul was from more than 200,000 grassroots donors across all 50 states. They attribute the gains, in part, to the fact that \u201cAmericans are ready to stand up and fight back against the Trump administration\u2019s overwhelmingly unpopular agenda.\u201d In February 2016, following the first full month of Trump\u2019s previous term, the party recorded pulling in less than $5 million in grassroots fundraising.",
      "The haul also comes amid Ken Martin\u2019s first month as party chair. The DNC cites the Minnesota Democrat\u2019s leadership as another reason they saw a boost in grassroots support. Top-performing fundraising emails, texts and peer-to-peer messages were signed by Martin in the month since his election on Feb. 1, the memo says.",
      "But the fundraising increase comes as the Democratic Party grapples with low approval ratings and intraparty fighting around their overall direction and response to the Trump administration\u2019s policies.",
      "A few recent polls indicate that the general public does not see any one person as leading the Democratic Party. One, from CNN/SSRS published on Sunday, found no consensus among American adults over which Democratic leader \u201cbest reflects the core values of the Democratic Party,\u201d while also showing that the Democratic Party\u2019s favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low.",
      "Just last week, a contentious battle brewed on Capitol Hill over whether to pass a GOP-approved government funding bill, hurled the party into discussions over their strategy and about potential changes in their leadership ranks.",
      "The DNC, however, has recently made plays to carve out its own lane among the larger party as a leading voice in response to Trump and Republicans.",
      "In the wake of the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s recent calls for GOP House members to pull back on hosting in-person town hall events while constituents have become heated about DOGE\u2019s cuts to the federal workforce, the DNC started pairing with other organizations and state parties across the country to host \u201cPeople\u2019s Town Halls\u201d in competitive districts with vulnerable GOP House incumbents.",
      "Another bright spot for Democrats in February, according to DNC fundraising data set to be publicly filed with the Federal Elections Commission later Thursday, is that this month marked the DNC\u2019s best fundraising month via digital ads in an off-year, with more than $1 million raised.",
      "\u201cWe expect significant return on investment by the 2026 midterms,\u201d the DNC said in the memo.",
      "The DNC is prioritizing \u201cbalancing high-performing fundraising formats\u201d with \u201cnew content that educates donors and invites them to volunteer or give the DNC feedback to better understand their priorities in our fight against Donald Trump,\u201d according to the memo.",

      "The petition, promoted online and at in-person events by Musk\u2019s America PAC, asks voters in the state to reject \"activist judges who impose their own views.\" Wisconsin voters who sign up are eligible to receive the $100, according to the PAC.",
      "The petition\u2019s language mirrors recent attacks by Musk and Trump on federal judges who have ruled against the administration. It reads: \"Judges should interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas. By signing below, I'm rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role \u2014 interpreting, not legislating.\"",
      "The petition also allows Musk\u2019s team to collect voter data for get-out-the-vote efforts ahead of next month\u2019s election.",
      "The world's richest man has used cash giveaways in past elections, including a controversial $1 million sweepstakes to voters in swing states who signed a second amendment petition in efforts to boost Trump's chances.",
      "So far, two political groups aligned with Musk -- America PAC and Building America\u2019s Future -- have poured nearly $20 million into supporting Republican candidate Brad Schimel.",
      "In a memo obtained by ABC News, Building America\u2019s Future said that internal polling showed Schimel was \"within striking distance\" of Democratic candidate Susan Crawford.

    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have arrested and detained Canadian and European travelers at U.S. borders in recent weeks",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Lennon Tyler and her German fianc\u00e9 often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day's drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.",
      "But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.",
      "U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Br\u00f6sche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.",
      "On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.",
      "Sielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he has never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the \u201cevolving\u201d federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning \u201cre-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",
      "Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",
      "\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff's 90-day tourist permit.",
      "When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, \u201cWhere are you going? Where do you live?\u201d Tyler said.",
      "\u201cEnglish is not Lucas' first language and so he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Las Vegas,' and the agent says, \u2019Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can't do that,'\" Tyler said, recounting what happened.",
      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",
      "After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.",
      "There, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.",
      "\u201cYou are angry, you are sad, you don\u2019t know when you can get out,\u201d Sielaff said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get any answers from anybody.\u201d",
      "He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.",
      "\u201cWhat happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol\u2019s power,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s happy to be home,\u201d Paschen said. \u201cShe seems very relieved if anything but she\u2019s not coming back here anytime soon.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker on a trip across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.",
      "On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur who had a visa to work in the U.S., was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said.",
      "Before Mooney's release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying, \u201cIt certainly reinforces anxiety that many British Columbians have, and many Canadians have, about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\"",
      "The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration's arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.",
      "Tyler plans to sue the U.S. government.",
      "Sielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas. He suffers nightmares and is considering therapy to cope with the trauma.",
      "\u201cNobody is safe there anymore to come to America as a tourist,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. Education Department says it has investigated dozens of universities for alleged racial discrimination, citing ties to a nonprofit organization that has helped Black and Latino students pursue business degrees",
      "Until recently, it was a little-known program to help Black and Latino students pursue business degrees.",
      "But in January, conservative strategist Christopher Rufo flagged the program known as The PhD Project in social media posts that caught the attention of Republican politicians. The program is now at the center of a Trump administration campaign to root out diversity, equity and inclusion programs in higher education.",
      "The U.S. Education Department last week said it was investigating dozens of universities for alleged racial discrimination, citing ties to the nonprofit organization. That followed a warning a month earlier that schools could lose federal money over \u201crace-based preferences\u201d in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life.",
      "The investigations left some school leaders startled and confused, wondering what prompted the inquiries. Many scrambled to distance themselves from The PhD Project, which has aimed to help diversify the business world and higher education faculty.",
      "The rollout of the investigations highlights the climate of fear and uncertainty in higher education, which President Donald Trump's administration has begun policing for policies that run afoul of his agenda even as he moves to dismantle the Education Department.",
      "There is a range of nonprofits that work to help minority groups advance in higher education but The PhD Project was not well known before Rufo began posting on X about its work with colleges, said Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to draw some lines between that incident and why 45 institutions that were partners with The PhD Project are getting this investigation announced,\u201d he said.",
      "The 45 colleges under investigation for ties to the organization include public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of California, Berkeley, along with private schools like Yale, Cornell, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The Education Department sent letters to the universities informing them its Office for Civil Rights had received a complaint and they were under investigation for allegedly discriminating against students on the basis of race or ethnicity because of a past affiliation with The PhD Project. The letters set a March 31 deadline for information about their relationship with the nonprofit.",
      "In a statement, the PhD Project said it aims to \u201ccreate a broader talent pipeline\" of business leaders. \u201cThis year, we have opened our membership application to anyone who shares that vision,\u201d it said.",
      "Public reaction from the universities\u2019 leadership has been minimal and cautious, with most issuing brief statements saying they will cooperate with investigators and refusing further comment.",
      "Colleges may see reason not to push back. The Trump administration has shown willingness to withhold federal funding over issues involving antisemitism allegations, diversity programs and transgender athletes. At Columbia University, under fire for its handling of pro-Palestinian protests, the administration pulled $400 million in federal money and threatened billions more if it does not comply with its demands.",
      "\u201cThere is a concern that if one university steps up and fights this then that university will have all of their funding cut,\u201d said Veena Dubal, general counsel for the American Association of University Professors. \u201cThey are being hindered not just by fear but a real collective action problem. None of these universities wants to be the next example.\u201d",
      "Some colleges moved swiftly to stop working with The PhD Project.",
      "The University of Kentucky said it severed ties with the nonprofit on Monday. The University of Wyoming said in a statement that its college of business was affiliated with the group to develop its graduate student pipeline, but it plans to discontinue its membership.",
      "The University of Nevada, Las Vegas issued a statement saying three professors participated in the program, but two no longer work at the university and a third was killed in a shooting on campus in 2023. Arizona State said its business school is not financially supporting The PhD Project this year and it told faculty in February the school would not support travel to the nonprofit\u2019s conference.",
      "Similar fallout came in Texas earlier this year, when Rufo began posting on X about the PhD Project.",
      "\u201cTexas A&M is sponsoring a trip to a DEI conference,\u201d Rufo posted on Jan. 13. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, accused the university of \u201csupporting racial segregation and breaking the law.\u201d",
      "The next day Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbot posted on X that the university \u201cpresident will soon be gone\u201d unless he immediately \u201cfixed\u201d the matter. Texas A&M responded by withdrawing from the conference, and soon after at least eight other Texas public universities that had participated previously in The PhD Project\u2019s conference also withdrew, the Texas Tribune reported.",
      "Rufo has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Some of the schools under investigation raised questions about where the complaints against them originated.",

      "An Adam's County Sheriff's Office deputy approached Joel Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 32, around 4:30 a.m. because he seemed suspicious, sheriff\u2019s spokesperson Sgt. Adam Sherman said. When it was determined he was one of the two men who escaped Tuesday night from the detention center in Aurora, Colorado, he was taken into temporary custody until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived, Sherman said.",
      "The other person who escaped on Tuesday night remained at large. They both apparently walked out of doors that opened during a power outage at the detention center in the Denver suburb, which is operated by The GEO Group under a contract with ICE.",
      "ICE officials said they immediately asked local authorities for help finding the men. But Aurora police chief Todd Chamberlain said that they were not notified until over four hours after the men were gone. By that time, Chamberlain said it was too late for police to help.",
      "Gonzalez-Gonzalez, who is from Mexico, had been held in the jail in Adams County from Feb. 9 through Feb. 12 in connection with local criminal charges, including second-degree motor vehicle theft, Sherman said. Court documents in the criminal case were not immediately available. He is being represented in that case by a lawyer from the public defender\u2019s office, which does not comment on its cases to the media.",
      "ICE said it arrested Gonzalez-Gonzalez on Feb. 12, and he was taken to its detention center pending immigration proceedings. Gonzalez-Gonzalez has been in the United States since 2013 and violated the conditions of his admission, it said.",
      "It is not known whether Gonzalez-Gonzalez may have a lawyer representing him in his immigration case.",

      "City councilmembers in Fort Myers agreed in an emergency meeting to allow local police to be trained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- City officials in Fort Myers, Florida, unanimously agreed to pass a memorandum on Friday allowing local authorities to receive training from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and assist with deportations. This decision reverses a contentious vote earlier this week that led to threats of suspension from state officials.",
      "The three-hour special meeting began with two hours of spirited public comment, with most speakers dissenting the memorandum by citing fears of increased racial profiling as a top concern. The presiding officer of public comment also continually interrupted speakers who discussed the council's vote or thanked councilmembers on Monday who disagreed with the memorandum, saying that it was off-topic to Friday's meeting.",
      "Then, councilmembers prompted questions to Fort Myers Deputy Police Chief Victor Medico and City Attorney Grant Alley, who Councilmember Darla Bonk called out for leaving members with multiple unanswered questions before Friday's presentation.",
      "\u201cI must express my grave concern that there was a significant dereliction of the duty on the part of my city attorney,\u201d said Bonk, who initially voted against the agreement earlier this week. \u201cWe, as councilmembers, were put in the position of voting on a matter that was not within our legal authority or jurisdiction, as a state rep also reminded us at the top of this meeting. The actions subjected us public servants to unnecessary grave, personal and professional risk.\u201d",
      "City officials' about-face comes a day after Gov. Ron DeSantis warned them that failing to approve an immigration agreement could have steep consequences, including suspension from office. Earlier this week, state Attorney General James Uthmeier announced an investigation of councilmembers who voted against the agreement, saying the city was implementing an illegal sanctuary policy.",
      "Councilmember Diana Giraldo said in the meeting that she was concerned with the memorandum's designation of authorized functions to police officers, saying it could boost racial profiling. These functions, according to the memorandum, include the power to arrest any immigrant who does not have legal status without a warrant and the power to interrogate any person believed to be an immigrant.",
      "Giraldo said the city already has been working with federal immigration agents for years, a reason she objected to any claims of Fort Myers being a sanctuary city.",
      "When asked, Alley said it was \u201cvery not clear\u201d whether the council violated the law, and that he'd normally suggest asking the attorney general. In this case, the attorney general weighed in, and when asked he advised the councilmembers to support this agreement.",
      "\u201cThe attorney general is not a court, but it is the top law enforcement, and they issue opinions, and this wasn't in the form of an opinion. This was in the form of an immediate compliance with state immigration laws,\u201d Alley said.",
      "In Uthmeier's letter, he cited laws passed by Florida legislators just earlier this year in a special session, which include provisions that say state and local law enforcement and supervising entities must use \u201cbest efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law.\u201d",

      "Authorities say a woman drowned her dog in a Florida airport bathroom and then boarded her international flight after she was prevented from bringing the white miniature schnauzer with her because of a paperwork issue",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A woman drowned her dog in a Florida airport bathroom and then boarded her international flight after she was prevented from bringing the white miniature schnauzer with her because of a paperwork issue, authorities said.",
      "The woman was arrested in Lake County on Wednesday on a charge of aggravated animal abuse, a third-degree felony. She was released on $5,000 bail.",
      "\u201cThis act was intentional and resulted in a cruel and unnecessary death of the animal,\u201d said an arrest affidavit from the Orlando Police Department.",
      "Online court records showed no attorney listed for the woman from Kenner, Louisiana.",
      "The investigation into the death of the 9-year-old schnauzer named Tywinn started in December when a janitor found the dog in a trash bag in a bathroom stall at Orlando International Airport.",
      "The janitor earlier had seen the woman in the stall cleaning up water and dog food from the stall's floor. The janitor was pulled away for a cleanup emergency and returned to the bathroom 20 minutes later where she found Tywinn in the trash container, along with a companion vest, collar, rabies tag, a dog travel bag and a bone-shaped dog tag with the woman's name and phone number, investigators said.",
      "Airport surveillance cameras captured the woman speaking for 15 minutes to a Latam Airlines agent with the dog in tow, walking into a bathroom near the ticketing area with the dog and exiting the bathroom without Tywinn less than 20 minutes later. The woman then went outside the terminal building, reentered a short time later, passed through security and boarded the Colombia-bound plane, the report said.",
      "Authorities said the woman had been told she could not bring her dog aboard because she did not have the proper paperwork. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, dogs traveling from the U.S. to Colombia must be accompanied by a veterinarian-issued health certificate and a rabies vaccination certificate.",
      "The dog was identified by its implanted microchip and a necropsy determined that Tywinn had been drowned. U.S. Customs and Border Protection also confirmed to detectives that the woman had boarded a flight to Bogota, Colombia, and then flew to Ecuador.",

      "Arlando \u201cTray\u201d Jones is among thousands of people seeking accountability under a new state law that eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims",
      "BALTIMORE -- Arlando \u201cTray\u201d Jones was a toddler when his dad was killed by Baltimore police during a robbery. His mom died several years later after battling alcoholism.",
      "His surviving relatives often struggled to provide for him. Sometimes the lights got turned off and the refrigerator was empty.",
      "Jones turned to a notorious neighborhood drug dealer, a sinister father figure whose lavish lifestyle demonstrated what could be achieved in the streets. Under the supervision of \u201cFat Larry,\u201d Jones finally had stable housing and money in his pocket, but violence was all around him. He started carrying a gun and punishing anyone who crossed him. Barely a teenager, he was charged with attempted murder and sent to juvenile detention in the early 1980s.",
      "There, at the Maryland Training School for Boys, Jones says a staff member repeatedly sexually assaulted him while another kept watch. The guards would corner children in dark spaces and bribe them with extra snacks and other special treatment, according to a slew of recent lawsuits alleging widespread misconduct in Maryland\u2019s juvenile detention facilities.",
      "\u201cThey broke me,\u201d Jones said, recounting how his abusers beat him into submission. \u201cEverything that connected me to my humanity was just gone.\u201d",
      "Jones is among thousands of people seeking accountability under a new state law that eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims. It was passed in 2023 with the Catholic Church abuse scandal in mind. But now Maryland lawmakers are scrambling to address an unexpected onslaught of cases targeting the state\u2019s juvenile justice system. They\u2019re worried the state budget can\u2019t support a potential payout.",
      "The Associated Press requested an interview with the state\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services, but the department responded with a statement instead.",
      "\u201cDJS takes allegations of sexual abuse of children in our care with utmost seriousness and we are working hard to provide decent, humane and rehabilitative environments for youth committed to the Department. We do not comment on pending litigation,\u201d the agency said.",
      "To the plaintiffs, it\u2019s no surprise that Maryland leaders failed to anticipate a public reckoning of this size. Many victims spent decades in silence, paralyzed by shame. They were some of Maryland\u2019s most vulnerable residents, mostly Black kids growing up in poverty with little family support.",
      "All these years later, Jones still broke down crying in an interview. \u201cBut now I know the shame is not mine to bear,\u201d he said.",
      "Maryland lawmakers passed the Child Victims Act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report that revealed widespread abuse within the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Before its passage, victims couldn\u2019t sue after they turned 38.",
      "The law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets. But state leaders didn\u2019t anticipate they\u2019d be facing similar budgetary concerns. Lawmakers are now considering new legislation to shield the state financially.",
      "An estimated 6,000 people have retained attorneys and new complaints are pouring in, according to lawyers involved. In addition to monetary damages, plaintiffs want mandated reform of Maryland\u2019s juvenile justice system.",
      "The system has drawn serious criticism over the years. A 2004 Justice Department report found a \u201cdeeply disturbing degree of physical abuse\u201d at the facility where Jones was detained, now called the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School. The state closed Hickey\u2019s youth treatment program in 2005, but it\u2019s still operating as a youth detention center.",
      "Many other facilities named in the lawsuits have already been closed, and state leaders have strengthened oversight in recent years. They\u2019ve also focused on detaining fewer youths.",
      "Advocates say they\u2019re confident the system is significantly less abusive than it was.",
      "Other states have faced similar reckonings after changing their laws. While juvenile arrests and detention rates are declining nationally, research shows the majority of detainees are children of color. A 2024 report from the nonprofit The Sentencing Project found Black youth are roughly five times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just in Maryland, it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d said attorney Corey Stern, who represents Jones and others. \u201cIt\u2019s really a ripple effect across the U.S.\u201d",
      "Still, the Maryland lawsuits paint a particularly disturbing picture. It wasn\u2019t just select facilities or a small group of abusive staff members, it was statewide and persisted for decades, attorneys say. The abuse was often a poorly kept secret, but the system repeatedly failed to stop it, the lawsuits say.",
      "In a complaint filed earlier this month, 69 people brought claims against the same abuser, a former housing supervisor at Hickey.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in that case, who asked to remain anonymous, said that as the abuse escalated, he started to avoid properly cleaning himself to become less desirable. He later spent decades struggling with addiction and mental health issues. He said suing the state \u201ceven now felt like I was snitching.\u201d The AP doesn\u2019t typically identify victims of abuse unless they want to be named.",
      "Nalisha Gibbs said she didn\u2019t initially report her abuse because no one would have listened. A past experience gave her proof of that.",
      "Not long before she went to juvenile detention over a missed curfew enforced by a school truancy officer, Gibbs said, she had been raped by an uncle \u2014 and punished by her mother when she didn\u2019t keep quiet about the abuse.",
      "In the detention center, a female guard would come to her cell at night and assault her. Gibbs said the woman would degrade her, calling her worthless and \u201ca throwaway.\u201d",
      "For coming home 15 minutes after curfew, she was sentenced to a lifetime of trauma.",
      "After 30 days in detention, Gibbs never went back to middle school. She ended up in foster care, where she suffered more sexual abuse. She spent most of her 20s addicted to drugs, sometimes living on the streets. But in 2008, she sought treatment. She enrolled in a transitional housing program and earned her GED. She now lives with her fianc\u00e9 and his mother.",
      "Thinking back on her childhood, she sees a scared little girl who needed an adult to stand up for her.",
      "\u201cShe just had so much life snuffed out by people mistreating her and mishandling her,\u201d Gibbs said through tears. \u201cBut I\u2019m not that little girl anymore. I can fight for myself.\u201d",
      "A couple years after being released from Hickey, Jones was involved in a fight over drugs that escalated into gunshots, killing Joshua O\u2019Neal.",
      "Jones was 16 when he was arrested and charged with murder. He was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison.",
      "He said the sexual abuse pushed him over the edge; if he was headed down a negative path before juvenile detention, that experience sent him hurtling toward the unchecked brutality of the drug game.",
      "In 2022, he was released from prison under a state law that allows sentence reductions for people convicted as children.",
      "During his incarceration, Jones earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology. He\u2019s studied philosophy and published two books. Now 56, he works at Georgetown University\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative, which teaches students about mass incarceration and prison reform.",
      "He said getting educated restored some of the humanity he lost. It helped him regain his freedom and gave him a second chance at life. It also made him question everything.",
      "\u201cAn orphan child surviving poverty as best I can,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere was my first chance?\u201d",

      "The case, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, was brought by Voice of America reporters, Reporters Without Borders and a handful of unions against the U.S. Agency for Global Media and Kari Lake, the failed Arizona candidate who is President Trump's representative there.",
      "\u201cIn many parts of the world, a crucial source of objective news is gone, and only censored state-sponsored news media is left to fill the void,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "Lake has described the broadcast agency as a \u201cgiant rot\u201d that needs to be stripped down and rebuilt.",
      "Voice of America dates to World War II as a source of objective news, often beamed into authoritarian countries. Funded by Congress, it is protected by a charter that guarantees its product pass muster for journalistic rigor.",
      "The lawsuit charges that the Trump administration has effectively shut it down unlawfully in the past week. Republicans have complained that the news source is infected by left-wing propaganda, a contention its operators say isn't backed up factually.",
      "\u201cThe second Trump administration has taken a chainsaw to the agency as a whole in an attempt to shutter it completely,\u201d the lawsuit said. There was no immediate response Friday to a request for comment from the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and a handful of sister networks.",
      "In an interview with Newsmax earlier this week, Lake described Voice of America as \u201clike having a rotten fish and trying to find a portion that you can eat.\u201d",
      "In a post on X, she said the Agency for Global Media is \u201ca giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer \u2014 a national security risk for the nation \u2014 and irretrievably broken. While there are bright spots within the agency with personnel who are talented and dedicated public servants, this is the exception rather than the rule.\u201d",

      "At VOA's sister operation, Radio Free Asia, unpaid furloughs took effect on Friday for roughly 240 people in the operation's Washington office, or 75% of the staff members, spokesman Rohit Mahajan said.

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Detectives have recovered four diamond earrings from a suspected thief two weeks after he gulped the Tiffany & Co. jewelry worth nearly $770,000 during his arrest on the side of a highway in the Florida Panhandle, authorities said Friday.",
      "The last of the four earrings stolen from the Tiffany store in Orlando was recovered from the suspect last week, the Orlando Police Department said Friday.",

      "History buffs have uncovered revelations about U.S. espionage in the 1960s in thousands of pages of newly released government records about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy",
      "History buffs dove into thousands of pages of government records released online this week, hoping for new nuggets about President John F. Kennedy's assassination. They instead found revelations about U.S. espionage in the massive document dump that also exposed some previously redacted personal information.",
      "The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration posted more than 63,000 pages of records on its website, following an executive order from President Donald Trump. Many of the documents had been released previously but with redactions that hid the names of CIA sources or details about its spying and covert operations in the 1960s.",
      "Kennedy was killed on Nov. 23, 1963, during a visit to Dallas. As his motorcade finished its parade route downtown, shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper\u2019s perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, night club owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast live on television.",
      "The latest release of documents pumped new energy into conspiracy theories about the assassination. Kennedy scholars said they haven\u2019t seen anything out of line with the conclusion that Oswald, a 24-year-old ex-Marine, was the lone gunman.",
      "\u201cThe chase for the truth will go on forever, I suspect,\" said Philip Shenon, who wrote a 2013 book about the killing of JFK.",
      "The vast majority of the National Archives\u2019 collection of more than 6 million related pages of records, photographs, motion pictures, sound recordings and artifacts had already been released before the archives posted about 2,200 files online this week.",
      "Writers, historians and conspiracy promoters have spent decades pushing for the release of all the records. In the early 1990s, the federal government mandated that all assassination-related documents be housed in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration. The collection was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president.",
      "According to researchers and the FBI, roughly 3,700 files held by federal authorities still haven't been released.",
      "Trump's order also called for declassifying the remaining federal records related to the 1968 assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "Scholars and history buffs described the latest release as rushed and expressed frustration that going through the files one by one represented a random search for unreleased information.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the reports about the lawyers staying up all night, which I believe, because there\u2019s there\u2019s a lot of sloppiness in this,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \u201cThe Kennedy Half-Century.\u201d",
      "Scholars and history buffs grumbled that, unlike past releases, the National Archives didn\u2019t provide an index or workable search tool. Also, the files included material generated after the 1960s, and some people listed in the records were angry to find out that sensitive information about them was revealed, including Social Security numbers.",
      "They include Joseph diGenova, a former campaign lawyer for Trump. His personal information was on documents relating to his work for a U.S. Senate select committee that investigated abuses of power by government officials in the 1970s, including the surveillance of U.S. citizens.",
      "He is planning to sue the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration for violating privacy laws.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the result of incompetent people doing the reviewing,\" he said. \"The people who reviewed these documents did not do their job.\u201d",
      "White House officials said a plan was in place to help those whose personal information was disclosed, including credit monitoring, until new Social Security numbers are issued. Officials are still screening the records to identify all the Social Security numbers that were released.",
      "The latest release represented a boon to mainstream historians, particularly those researching international relations, the Cold War and the activities of the CIA.",
      "One revelation was that a key adviser warned President Kennedy after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 that the CIA had grown too powerful. The aide proposed giving the State Department control of \u201call clandestine activities\u201d and breaking up the CIA.",
      "The page of Special Assistant Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s memo outlining the proposal had not been released before. A previous release of part of his memo redacted Schlesinger\u2019s statement that 47% of the political officers in U.S. embassies were controlled by the CIA.",

    "story": [
      "As President Donald Trump's administration seeks to roll back funding for transit, walking and biking projects, some states are trying to advance them on their own",
      "CHICAGO -- Hundreds of bicycle advocates were at an annual summit this month in Washington, D.C., when their cellphones lit up over breakfast with an urgent email warning that President Donald Trump's transportation department had just halted federal grant funding for bike lanes.",
      "As the administration targets green energy projects championed by former President Joe Biden that boosted transit, recreational trails and bicycle infrastructure, several states are banding together to advance those priorities on their own.",
      "California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania joined forces for a national organizing effort dubbed the Clean Rides Network. The group gained momentum in various statehouses this year on environmentally friendly transportation projects it contends the federal government has abandoned.",
      "\u201cThese are changes we need to make anyway, but they\u2019re more urgent than ever,\u201d said Justin Balik, senior state program director for the environmental advocacy group Evergreen Action and one of the organizers of the Clean Rides Network. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling the state departments of transportation the next frontier of climate advocacy.\u201d",
      "Although Colorado wasn't among the seven charter members of the Clean Rides Network, a policy enacted there set the framework for one of its most ambitious goals.",
      "In 2021, Gov. Jared Polis committed to a dramatic reduction in Colorado's greenhouse gas emissions and employed a novel approach to accelerate the timeline. Whenever the state's transportation department commits money to a large-scale project that increases vehicle traffic such as a new highway, it must also pursue a corresponding project to offset the environmental harms.",
      "Two major highway expansion projects were canceled because of the policy, said Matt Frommer of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. The group advocated for the change.",
      "Colorado used the savings to expand an intercity bus service that has soared in popularity for urban residents and tourists traveling to ski resorts.",
      "Polis' vision lined up with the multimodal transportation aims under the $1.1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed that year. In the final months of Biden's administration, the city of Denver won a $150 million federal grant to build a rapid transit bus line along one of its busiest corridors.",
      "Frommer, a transportation and land use policy manager, said there are fears that states will now have to pursue projects like that on their own.",
      "\u201cIf your state cares about climate change, you need to take the reins and step up and direct your transportation funds to projects that are going to reduce emissions,\" Frommer said. \u201cWe may not be able to rely on the federal government to put that policy in place or to really help you in many ways.\u201d",
      "Minnesota followed Colorado's lead and adopted a similar rule to offset greenhouse emissions. Other states that are part of the network are pushing proposals this session.",
      "The Maryland House recently passed its version of the Colorado law, and Senate sponsor Shelly Hettleman said she's cautiously optimistic it will win final passage before lawmakers adjourn.",
      "In trying to persuade her colleagues, Hettleman has focused less on the environmental benefits than what she sees as economic ones. A study commissioned by the Colorado transportation department projected up to $40 billion in savings through improved air quality, road safety and reduced traffic congestion, among other things.",
      "Lawmakers in the Clean Rides states of Illinois and Massachusetts have advanced similar proposals, but they've encountered resistance from some business leaders and advocates for road construction.",
      "\u201cThis is another ill-advised piece of legislation, not based upon science, that will defer needed improvements to our crumbling transportation infrastructure in Illinois,\" said Mike Sturino, president and CEO of the Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Association. \u201cCommuters will have to wait for improvements to our existing interstate system, as this bill would delay addressing unsafe conditions on our roads and bridges.\u201d",
      "Although most of the state leaders who have pushed alternative transportation options have been Democrats, the Clean Rides Network said more conservative states have shown interest in some of the topics, too.",
      "Just as Colorado's anticipated cost savings helped spur legislation in Maryland, economic concerns continue to be foremost in the minds of residents, with some studies showing that transportation ranks second to housing in consumer costs.",
      "\u201cForget about the cost of eggs. It\u2019s never been more expensive to drive a car,\u201d said Miguel Moravec with the nonprofit climate think tank RMI, which created a calculator to help states project the money they could save through policies that reduce emissions.",
      "Virginia employs a scale that scores potential transportation projects based on factors such as safety, congestion relief, and environmental impacts.",
      "Utah launched an ambitious transit plan for the rapidly growing state, while Montana implemented land use and zoning reforms that made cities more walkable.",
      "Muhammed Patel, senior transportation advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Chicago, said states are at least rethinking some of their policy priorities.",
      "\u201cWe do live luckily in a country where states have authority over their own transportation systems,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThere\u2019s flexibility innately built in.\u201d",

      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- A new museum devoted to telling the stories of those who have received the nation's highest military honor is opening this coming week in Texas.",
      "The National Medal of Honor Museum is set to open Tuesday in Arlington, just west of Dallas. It highlights the lives and service of Medal of Honor recipients from the Civil War to the global war on terrorism. Over 3,500 people have received the Medal of Honor, which is awarded by Congress for risking one's life in combat beyond the call of duty.",
      "Jack Jacobs, a retired U.S. Army colonel who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Vietnam War, said he wants museum visitors to realize the recipients aren't \u201cspectacular supermen,\" but regular people who \u201cembody the kinds of values that are really important.\"",
      "\u201cReally grand things, not just in combat, but in everyday life ... are all accomplished by ordinary people who come to the conclusion that something has to be done and they are going to do it,\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "When his unit was ambushed by the Viet Cong on March 9, 1968, Jacobs took charge after his commander was seriously wounded. Despite being wounded in the head by shrapnel and bleeding heavily, Jacobs reorganized the company and repeatedly ran through enemy fire to rescue the wounded, saving the lives of a U.S. adviser and 13 soldiers.",
      "Jacobs, now 79, said he lost a lot of friends in the battle.",
      "\u201cYou really do wear the award for all of the people who can't wear the award,\u201d he said.",
      "The museum's focus is on telling the life stories of the recipients, said Alexandra Rhue, the museum's senior vice president of engagement. \u201cHere you met the people first and then you learn what they did,\u201d Rhue said.",
      "The recipients featured in the museum include those from various branches of the military, conflicts and geographic locations, as well as different ethnicities and races.",
      "Chris Cassidy, the museum's president and CEO, said he hopes the exhibits inspire visitors.",
      "\u201cEverybody needs courage in some form or fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that's our aim: to inspire people through the stories of Medal of Honor actions, to bring a little courage into your own life.\u201d",
      "Several of the recipients, including Jacobs, appear in videos in an exhibit where their images answer visitors' questions. There are over 60 recipients who are still living.",
      "A celebration Saturday ahead of the opening will feature musical performances, fireworks and a drone show. The museum is nestled amongst Globe Life Field, where the Texas Rangers play, and AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys.",

      "But municipal and library officials said on Friday that U.S. authorities have unilaterally decided to end the century-old unwritten agreement. Coming at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries, the decision is prompting an outpouring of emotion in communities on both sides of the border, which in places has been marked simply by flower pots.",
      "Inside the library celebrated as a symbol of international friendship, Pauline Lussier and Chris Blais put their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders Friday as they stood on either side of the line taped down the floor marking the border. Lussier, a Canadian, and Blais, an American met for the first time that day.",

      "Once inside the library, Canadian and American citizens have been able to mingle freely across the border line drawn on the floor \u2013 as long as they return to the proper country afterward. In 2016, then-president Barack Obama hailed the symbolic importance of the library, built in 1901. \u201cA resident of one of these border towns once said, \u2018We\u2019re two different countries, but we\u2019re like one big town,\u2019\u201d Obama said.",
      "A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP, confirmed that the divide is about to become more pronounced. Starting in the coming days, only library card holders and employees will be able to cross over from Canada to enter the building through the main door on the U.S. side.",
      "And as of Oct. 1, no Canadians will be able to enter the library via the United States without going through the border checkpoint, though there will be exceptions for law enforcement, emergency services, mail delivery, official workers and those with disabilities.",
      "The statement acknowledged the library as a \u201cunique landmark,\u201d but said the border agency was phasing in a new approach for security reasons.",
      "\u201cDue to the library\u2019s location, and convenience of local populations, CBP has allowed customers of the library to access its sidewalk, without inspection, for decades,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cHowever, during that time, this area has witnessed a continued rise in illicit cross-border activity.\u201d",
      "It noted there have been a number of incidents in and around the library that resulted in apprehensions in recent years, including a person attempting to smuggle firearms in the past year.",
      "Town and library officials say Canadian visitors without a library card will have to enter by a back door on the Canadian side, across a muddy stretch of grass. The library announced Friday that it was launching a GoFundMe to raise the estimated $100,000 Canadian (US$69,000) it will cost to build a sidewalk, new parking lot and wheelchair access.",
      "Stanstead Mayor Jody Stone said the U.S. decision \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d However, he said the decision from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would not affect the close bond between the communities, which share municipal services and facilities.",
      "\u201cNo matter what this administration does, it will not change the fact that Stanstead and Derby Line are partners and friends forever,\u201d he said.",

      "In what has become a Ramadan tradition, a group of volunteers in Dearborn, Michigan, gathers excess food prepared for the nightly fast-breaking iftar meal and distributes it to those in need in neighboring Detroit",
      "DEARBORN, Mich. -- After a nightly iftar meal with family members breaking fast together during Ramadan, Nadine Daoud noticed full pots and trays of untouched leftover food lining the shelves of her grandmother's refrigerator. Too often, she felt the food was quickly forgotten and then wasted.",
      "The observations inspired her 2017 creation of The Helping Handzzz Foundation that brings volunteers together each year during the Islamic holy month. They round up spare food from families in Dearborn \u2014 where nearly half the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent \u2014 and bring it to people without homes in neighboring Detroit.",
      "Daoud said the group's efforts are emblematic of Islam's emphasis on respecting and valuing resources such as food and matches Ramadan's focus on \u201cself-discipline and empathy toward those less fortunate.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery family cooks a lot of food to end the night when you\u2019re breaking your fast,\u201d Daoud said. \u201cAnd a lot of food gets left over. And we noticed that a lot of this food was just getting stored in the fridge and forgotten about the next day.",
      "\u201cWhat I decided to do was instead of sticking it in the fridge and forgetting about it or throwing it in the trash, I said, \u2018Let me take it. I always see people on the corners. Let me help out and give it to them instead with a drink and a nice treat on the side.\u2019\"",
      "One recent night, Helping Handzzz board members Hussein Sareini and Daoud Wehbi and four others enjoyed an iftar prepared by Sareini\u2019s mother.",
      "When the meal ended, several attendees said some of the daily prayers. Then, Wehbi hopped in Sareini\u2019s truck, and they stopped at several area homes to pick up untouched dishes. From there, they drove to the parking lot of a nearby mosque, where Nadine Daoud and others organized the food.",
      "A caravan of vehicles then visited several spots in Detroit where people without housing regularly can be found.",
      "Board member Mariam Hachem approached a man bundled up in blankets and lying on the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cHi, we have a meal for you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to set it right here, OK?\u201d",
      "\u201cOK,\u201d came the response.",
      "Other volunteers added bottled water and a sweet treat alongside the food container.",
      "The Helping Handzzz team goes through the same process six nights each week during the sacred month, taking off Sundays. And it comes after going without food or water from sunrise to sunset.",
      "Wehbi, 27, is a design engineer at Toyota. Sareini demolishes bathrooms and kitchens and rebuilds them as part of his residential remodeling business.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Oakland, California, voters who recalled their mayor in November over crime, homelessness and allegations of corruption are weighing whether to give the job to former U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, a progressive icon and Black female trailblazer who represented the city in Congress for over two decades.",
      "The 78-year-old Lee is widely considered the front-runner in the April 15 election. This is despite her politics in a state where progressives have not fared well lately, partly over perceptions they are too soft on crime.",
      "Former Mayor Sheng Thao was ousted barely two years into her term. Voters in November also recalled Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price, whose territory included Oakland, and Los Angeles County voters denied progressive DA George Gasc\u00f3n a second term in office.",
      "Ballots for the Oakland race have been mailed and voting is underway.",
      "Lee is walking a careful line in how she addresses public safety in an Oakland that has become less permissive and more strident about punishing wrongdoers, like many other Democratic cities in California where voters are exasperated over grimy street conditions and empty storefronts.",
      "Her leading opponent is Loren Taylor, 47, a former Oakland City Council member who supports using drones and surveillance cameras to fight crime.",
      "\u201cShe can\u2019t govern on the public safety front as a progressive or liberal. That has been repudiated throughout the state of California and almost nationally,\u201d said James Taylor, a political science professor at the University of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cSo she\u2019s going to have to find a good team of people around her who will help administer the balance between community and neighborhood and individual rights and overall public safety,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Oaklanders want the streets to be safe.\u201d",
      "Oakland has long been the cheaper, funkier alternative to San Francisco across the Bay. The city of 400,000 is deeply liberal and multicultural, the birthplace of the Black Panther Party and claimed by former Vice President Kamala Harris as her hometown.",
      "But the city also is reeling from tent encampments, public drug use, illegal sideshows, gun violence and brazen robberies that prompted In-N-Out Burger to close its first location ever last year. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent California Highway Patrol officers to help combat what he called an alarming and unacceptable rise in crime. Oakland also doesn't have enough money to pay for public services.",
      "On the campaign trail, Lee emphasizes the need for more community services as well as more police. She wants guns off the streets and more money for crime prevention. Economic development, job creation and ensuring core city services like fire hydrants work properly are among her priorities.",
      "Lee rejects the idea that her progressive politics are at odds with the city.",
      "\u201cI believe that my values are Oakland values,\u201d Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Lee was first elected to the U.S. House in 1998 and became best known nationally as the only lawmaker to vote against the 2001 authorization for the use of military force in response to the Sept. 11 attacks. She ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate last year.",
      "Her chief opponent, Taylor, who also is Black, says Oakland needs a pragmatic mayor who knows city government.",
      "\u201cThe problems we\u2019re facing, the things that need to be fixed in Oakland, she\u2019s not the right fit,\" he said of Lee. Consensus-building skills honed in Congress don\u2019t always serve the needs of an executive in City Hall. For example, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, also a former member of Congress, is taking heat over January\u2019s deadly wildfires, with some calling for a more take-charge mayor.",
      "In Oakland, Lee and Taylor agree the Oakland Police Department needs 800 officers, up from the under 700 it has now. Taylor says he has a plan to get to 800 in three years, while Lee says it will be difficult.",
      "Lee wants to test a guaranteed basic income program for homeless people and called the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling making it easier for cities to clear encampments \"cruel.\" Taylor voted against defunding police in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing by a police officer in 2020. He wants to clear homeless encampments and supports the use of drones, license plate readers and cameras to nab perpetrators.",
      "Taylor, an engineer, served on the Oakland City Council from 2019 to 2023 and narrowly lost a bid for mayor in 2022 to Sheng Thao. He supported the recall while Lee opposed it.",
      "Brenda Harbin-Forte, a retired judge who helped lead the recall, said she hopes voters will see beyond Lee's star power.",
      "\"I did not recall Sheng Thao to have Sheng Thao 2.0 in office,\u201d she said.",
      "But Carl Chan, a Chinatown community leader and recall leader, said he believes either Taylor or Lee will focus on the budget, public safety and economic revitalization. He hopes they will work together no matter who wins.",

In the same meeting, the board voted to immediately dismiss the executive director of the state library agency, who had been planning to resign.",
      "Board Chairman John Wahl, who is also the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, said board members believe the Fairhope library is in violation of state policies to protect children from inappropriate materials. The books cited by the upset parents included \u201cSold,\" a National Book Award finalist about a girl who is sold into sexual slavery in India.",
      "The actions come amid a broader national culture war over library content and programs and a surging number of challenges to books on library shelves. The American Library Association\u2019s list of the most-challenged books of 2023 included many with LGBTQIA+ or sexual content.",
      "\u201cI think that the GOP chair on the State Library Board is forcing the removal of books just because of anti-library extremists. I think that\u2019s ignoring the voices of Fairhope taxpayers and library users,\u201d said Amber Frey of Read Freely Alabama, an organization that has opposed the restrictions.",
      "The action against the Fairhope Library is the first taken under a new Alabama law and 2024 administrative code changes that say to receive state funding, local libraries must have policies to safeguard youth from \u201csexually explicit or other material deemed inappropriate for children or youth.\u201d",
      "Wahl said they aren\u2019t trying to ban the books, but he maintained the state code requires \u201cthe actual relocation of these books out of youth sections.\"",
      "\u201cWe are unapologetic about standing up for Alabama families and putting them in control, even if that means temporarily defunding local libraries until they can be compliant,\u201d Wahl said.",
      "He said parents objecting to the books read excerpts during the meeting to demonstrate why they believe the books do not belong in the teen section.",
      "Clean Up Alabama, a group that along with Moms for Liberty had sought restrictions, praised the decision. \u201cWe saw the board step up in the fight to protect our children,\u201d the group said in a statement.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re devastated and really stunned by this. We had no warning that this was going to happen,\u201d Randal Wright said.",

      "An appeals court has upheld California\u2019s law banning gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, a decision that prompted one judge to record an unusual video dissent while loading guns in his chambers",
      "LOS ANGELES -- An appeals court ruled Thursday that California\u2019s law banning gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition can remain in place, a decision that prompted one judge to record an unusual video dissent that shows him loading guns in his chambers.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that the law was permissible under the Second Amendment because large-capacity magazines are not considered \u201carms\u201d or \u201cprotected accessories.\"",
      "Even if they were, California's ban \u201dfalls within the Nation\u2019s tradition of protecting innocent persons by prohibiting especially dangerous uses of weapons and by regulating components necessary to the firing of a firearm,\" the opinion stated.",
      "Judge Lawrence VanDyke disagreed, and included a link to a video of himself posted on YouTube in his dissent.",
      "\u201cThis is the first video like this that I've ever made,\u201d VanDyke said. \u201cI share this because a rudimentary understanding of how guns are made, sold, used, and commonly modified makes obvious why California's proposed test and the one my colleagues are adopting today simply does not work.\u201d",
      "In the video, VanDyke handles several guns in his chambers and demonstrates how they are loaded and fired. He also shows high-capacity magazines and argues that they are no different from other gun accessories that could be added to a firearm to make it more dangerous. Under the majority's logic, he said, that would allow the government to pick and choose any of them to be banned.",
      "Judge Marsha S. Berzon criticized VanDyke's video in a separate opinion, saying he was including \u201cfacts outside the record\u201d and was, in essence, appointing himself an expert witness in the case.",
      "The law has remained in effect as the state appealed a 2023 ruling by a district court judge in San Diego that it was unconstitutional. The ruling was in response to legal action filed by four individuals and the California Rifle & Pistol Association challenging the law\u2019s constitutionality under the Second Amendment.",
      "The majority opinion judges said their decision to uphold the law is in line with a Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that set a new standard that relies more on the historical tradition of gun regulation rather than public interests, including safety.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta praised the appeals court's decision.",
      "\u201cThis commonsense restriction on how many rounds a gunman can fire before they must pause to reload has been identified as a critical intervention to limit a lone shooter\u2019s capacity to turn shootings into mass casualty attacks,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"Let me be clear, this law saves lives.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers on Friday approved tax breaks for farmers and timber owners harmed by Hurricane Helene that could be worth nearly $300 million.",
      "House members voted unanimously to send the bill to Gov. Brian Kemp for his approval.",
      "\u201cThis is a part of the Hurricane Helene recovery package that specifically addresses issues for farmers and foresters,\u201d said House Majority Whip James Burchett, a Republican from Waycross.",
      "The tax breaks come on top of $862 million in spending that Georgia lawmakers earlier allotted for Hurricane Helene relief after the storm caused billions of dollars in damage when it cut across the eastern half of the state in September.",
      "The bill would exempt federal crop insurance and disaster payments to farmers because of Helene damage from Georgia state income taxes. That could be worth $140 million.",
      "Farmers in Georgia are already collecting hundreds of millions in crop insurance payments. Georgia officials estimate the state's farmers are also likely to collect $2.4 billion in federal disaster relief payments from the $30.8 billion allocated to cover disaster losses in a December law passed by Congress.",

But the department has not yet disbursed any of the other aid despite rising frustration among farmers.",
      "Georgia's bill would also let private timberland owners claim a credit on their state income taxes for damaged timber if they replant trees. The credit, available in 66 disaster-area counties, would be good for up to $550 per acre. The timberland tax break could be worth $83 million to $104 million through 2030, estimates show.",
      "Another tax break would waive state and local sales taxes on building materials needed to rebuild chicken houses, barns, fences and other structures.",
      "A fourth program would let counties waive the taxes they collect when timberland owners cut down trees for the last three months of 2024 and all of 2025. Any county that chooses to waive taxes would refund any taxes collected since Oct. 1. The state would spend an estimated $17.4 million to replace counties' lost tax money.",
      "\u201cWhen you go from Valdosta to Augusta, it\u2019s pretty devastating,\u201d said Sen. Russ Goodman, a Republican from Cogdell. \"You've got not only these folks who have lost their inheritance, or their children\u2019s inheritance, or their retirement and everything else. But you've got to look at what it means to the local community as far as losing all the revenue because the timber crop was destroyed.\"",
      "Georgia lawmakers earlier this month approved $285 million for low-interest loans to farmers and to remove downed trees from private lands so they don\u2019t become a fire hazard. There\u2019s also $25 million in grants to nonprofits that are supposed to go to help individuals.",

      "He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".",
      "Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".",
      "That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.",
      "This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.",

      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",

      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",
      "However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.",

      "\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.",
      "A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.",
      "Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.",

      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",

      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",
      "\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.",
      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

      "He added that, coming out of lockdowns, there was a period of \"unusually higher earnings\" for drivers, as demand outstripped supply of available rides.",
      "\"We're more in a sort of normal situation now, but that probably affects some of the experiences that [drivers] have had,\" he says.",

Upstairs, software engineers are simulating how the aircraft will operate. I watch as the helicopter sees an oil rig, identifies it, and takes a route around it.",
      "In another example, Mr Colman imagines the aircraft dropping sonar buoys and flying over a small fishing boat. An optical camera under the helicopter would identify the craft, and choose a new position to drop the buoy.",
      "They have been making helicopters in Yeovil at this factory for 80 years. Today, the company is owned by Leonardo. In all, more than 50% of the helicopters flown by the British armed forces were built in this factory.",
      "People working on the new ground-breaking project are clearly proud of it.",

      "Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",

      "In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.",
      "US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".",
      "Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.",
      "And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?",
      "A larger-than-life figurehead",
      "Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.",
      "Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.",
      "\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.",
      "Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.",
      "Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.",
      "But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.",
      "'Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla'",
      "Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.",
      "The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.",
      "This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.",
      "Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.",
      "In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.",
      "Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y \u2013 with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.",
      "In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"",
      "Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.",
      "But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.",
      "'Dated' models and overseas competition",
      "To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.",
      "\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"",
      "Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"",
      "Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.",
      "At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.",
      "\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.",
      "\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"",
      "The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.",
      "The question of robotaxis",
      "Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.",
      "In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.",
      "In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.",
      "\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.",
      "Is Musk spinning too many plates?",
      "Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.",
      "Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".",
      "\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.",
      "\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"",
      "Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.",
      "That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.",
      "For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.",
      "Calls for new blood at the top",
      "Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.",
      "\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.",
      "None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.",
      "But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"",
      "\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.",
      "\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"",

      "However, the number of people not looking for work has been brought into sharp focus as the government brings in plans to try to boost UK economic growth.",
      "The figures come after controversial plans to cut sickness and disability benefits were announced this week, and ahead of next week's Spring Statement when Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give an update on her economic plans.",
      "On Tuesday, the government announced sweeping cuts to sickness and disability benefits aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "It says the measures will encourage people to work while protecting those who cannot.",
      "But the reforms have faced fierce criticism from Labour backbenchers, unions and charities, who say the changes could push more disabled people into poverty.",

      "It increased during the Covid pandemic, and has fluctuated around this increased rate.",

    "story": [
      "The US central bank has cut its growth forecast as it warned President Donald Trump's tariffs were \"clearly\" driving up prices.",
      "The Federal Reserve released its projections for the world's largest economy on Wednesday while keeping interest rates unchanged again, saying it wanted to see how the White House policies unfold.",
      "That decision, which was widely expected, kept the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate hovering around 4.3%, where it has stood since December.",
      "After the announcement, Trump, who has previously criticised the central bank, called on it to cut rates.",
      "\"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\" the US President said on his platform Truth Social.",
      "\"Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!\"",
      "Earlier, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economy still appeared healthy, despite a sharp downturn in sentiment and \"remarkably high\" uncertainty.",
      "But he warned tariffs - which are taxes on imports - were likely to slow growth and hinder the bank's efforts to keep prices stable, noting recent data showing a rise in goods prices.",
      "\"Clearly some of it, a good part of it, is coming from tariffs,\" he said, speaking after the Fed's rates announcement on Wednesday.",
      "\"Progress is probably delayed for the time being,\" he added.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has announced blitz of new tariffs while also calling for big cuts to taxes, regulation, and government spending.",
      "Economists have long warned that some of those policies could cause prices to rise, at least in the short-term, and raise uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Analysts say the concerns have also helped to drive a sell-off in the stock market, with the S&P 500 falling 10% from February back to levels last seen in September.",
      "Trump has acknowledged there could be \"a little disturbance\" from his tariffs, but says the policies will lead to long-term growth.",
      "Inflation and economic downturn fears",
      "The dynamic has added to the challenges facing the Fed, which has spent much of the last three years trying to keep prices stable and avoid economic downturn.",
      "Mr Powell said the bank was assuming that tariffs would cause a one-time jump in prices, rather than a more sustained increase, but it is also bracing for a hit to growth.",
      "The forecasts showed policymakers now expect inflation to stand at 2.7% at the end of this year, up from the 2.5% they had predicted in December.",
      "They are also expecting growth of just 1.7% this year, down from the 2.1% previously anticipated.",
      "Though it kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, the forecasts suggest the bank still expects to cut rates by the end of the year.",
      "The Fed also said it would slow down selling assets, such as government debt, in a move that effectively offers more support for the economy.",
      "\"For the time being, the Fed is in wait and see mode, as it monitors whether the recent growth slowdown develops into something more serious,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",

      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, a policy arm of the US government, dismissed concerns about the effect of the tariffs.",
      "\"Chairman Powell is clear that if there were a tariff effect, it's a transitory one,\" he said, adding that he respected the \"independence of the Fed, as we all do within the White House\".",
      "The Fed hiked borrowing costs significantly starting in 2022, aiming to cool the economy and ease the pressures pushing up prices.",
      "Inflation, the rate of price increases, has since fallen to 2.8% as of February, but remains above the bank's 2% target.",
      "Recent surveys also suggest that public sentiment has sunk, while expectations for inflation have risen, which could make the bank's job stabilising prices more difficult.",
      "Households expecting prices to rise have incentive to buy now. But that can fuel inflation, as firms respond to the increased demand by raising prices further.",

    "story": [
      "Former sub-postmaster Lee Castleton is launching legal action against the Post Office and Fujitsu, becoming the first individual Horizon IT scandal victim to sue the two organisations.",
      "His case is one of the most high profile in the scandal in which hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully convicted after faulty software said money was missing from their branch accounts.",
      "Mr Castleton is seeking compensation, alleging the civil judgement against him was obtained by fraud. \"I want justice and to be publicly vindicated,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The Post Office said it was \"committed to doing all we can to help those affected get closure\".",
      "\"We cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings but once we receive the claim, we will engage fully in the process,\" a spokesperson added.",
      "Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon IT system, declined to comment when asked about Mr Castleton's legal action.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr Castleton instructed his solicitors, Simons Muirhead Burton, to issue proceedings at the High Court against the Post Office and Fujitsu on his behalf.",
      "While other victims have seen their convictions overturned, Mr Castleton's civil judgement against him still stands.  His legal action is to set aside, or overturn, the judgement.",
      "\"I'd like to effectively have my day in court as well,\" said Mr Castleton who is due to receive his OBE next month.",
      "He told the BBC he has little faith in the compensation schemes the Post Office has set up to compensate the wrongfully convicted sub-postmasters that he wants his case to be heard in court instead.",
      "Mr Castleton never started the compensation scheme process, although he has received an interim payment.",
      "He says he also wanted to take the action to help other victims fighting for their compensation.",
      "The Horizon IT scandal was thrust back into the spotlight when the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, aired last year.",

      "When his legal insurance ran out, Mr Castleton had to represent himself in court and was landed with a bill of \u00a3321,000 in legal costs which he couldn't pay and declared bankruptcy.",
      "\"We now know from the Post Office Inquiry that they wanted to make an example of me,\" he said.",
      "\"Lee faced a David versus Goliath battle against the Post Office and we are fully ready to take this all the way to trial should we need to,\" says his lawyer, Simon Goldberg.",
      "During the public inquiry it emerged that that Fujitsu's log of known errors wasn't disclosed to Mr Castleton during his court proceedings.",
      "The application to the court in Lee's case will say that the Post Office, conspiring with others, withheld evidence about the unreliability of the Horizon system. A witness from Fujitsu also gave evidence in his case.",
      "\"What we're effectively going to be saying is that the claim against his was an abuse of process. It was never about recovery of the sum of money - it was to make an example of Mr Castleton\" says Mr Goldberg.",
      "\"We also believe the judgement was obtained by fraud in that the Post Office and Fujitsu knew perfectly well that the Horizon system wasn't working properly,\" he added."

    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 01:27:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:27:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Could this be a chance for the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy to shed protectionism and open up further?",
    "story": [
      "India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.",
      "Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.",
      "Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?",
      "Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.",
      "High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.",
      "The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, already seems to have shifted gears.",
      "Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.",
      "Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)",
      "Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to \"come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence\", according to a statement from his ministry.",
      "India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.",
      "In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.",
      "India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.",
      "Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.",
      "High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "This has allowed \"cosy incumbents\" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires \"reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism\".",
      "With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.",
      "\"We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,\" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.  \"A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.\"",
      "In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a \"unique opportunity to shape a new vision\" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.",
      "By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a \"re-globalised\" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.",
      "\"By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,\" she adds.",
      "That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.",
      "India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.",
      "\"While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.",
      "According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a \"universal reduction\" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.",
      "However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the \"short run\".",
      "\"To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,\" she says.",
      "There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.",
      "Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), believes that India's tendency to soften trade policies \"based on rhetoric rather than economic pressure\" shows a lack of assertiveness in global trade talks.",
      "If this trend continues, he says, India may end up making even more compromises in its trade deal with the US, further \"eroding its bargaining power\".",
      "\"In comparison to other major economies, India's pre-emptive surrender on multiple trade fronts - without the US imposing a single country-specific tariff - makes it appear exceptionally vulnerable to pressure tactics.\"",
      "The broader consensus seems to be that India should capitalise on what could be the unintended consequences of Trump's tariff wars. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, believes that \"potential US tariffs may have become a catalyst for reforms.\".",
      "\"If supply chains are rejigged again during the second Trump presidency due to higher tariffs on large exporters, and the world looks for new producers, India may get a second chance,\" she writes.",
      "Creating jobs that manufacture goods for the world won't be easy. India has largely missed the bus on low-end, unskilled factory work - jobs China dominated for decades. Automation is taking over. Without deeper reforms, India risks being left behind.",

      "She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.",

      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has risen to close to 40%.",

    "summary": "Plans to axe a fifth of the workforce at Dundee University have drawn attention to problems in the sector.",
    "story": [
      "Scotland's universities are hitting a crunch point with their finances, forcing job losses on a scale we used to see from major factory closures and raising questions about whether they can all survive.",
      "Dundee University is cutting 632 full-time jobs \u2013 a fifth of its workforce - as it tries to tackle a \u00a335m deficit, and its underlying financial position looks even worse.",
      "The University of Edinburgh is looking to make \u00a3140m of cuts over the next 18 months. That figure is equivalent to about a tenth of the annual spending at the institution, which now has about 15,000 staff on its payroll.",
      "Aberdeen University has also cut staff through voluntary redundancy programmes, while the city's Robert Gordon University has put 135 roles \"at risk\" - which usually means they are bound to go.",
      "It has been suggested that more than 80 universities across the UK face deficits of between \u00a310m and \u00a350m, with Durham and Cardiff both planning significant spending cuts.",
      "When the Scottish Funding Council publishes its delayed annual assessment of the sector, it is expected to say that more than half of Scotland's institutions are running a deficit.",
      "They all face similar pressures, but some have done better than others at foreseeing the danger and planning for it.",
      "So what are the challenges facing the sector in Scotland?",
      "The level of student funding",
      "Scottish students get \"free tuition\". Undergraduates don't have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.",
      "The Scottish government has committed to pay the tuition costs, which it does through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).",
      "Universities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.",
      "It says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.",
      "The figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.",
      "It says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.",
      "While the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.",
      "But that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.",
      "Using a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.",
      "The IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.",
      "How does that compare with elsewhere?",
      "Undergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.",
      "These are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.",
      "Students from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.",
      "While the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.",
      "However, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.",
      "The maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.",
      "Because England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.",
      "The more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.",
      "The vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.",
      "With these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.",
      "The overseas recruitment drive",
      "UK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "The number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.",
      "The most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",
      "It has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.",
      "Growth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.",
      "It fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.",
      "The volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.",
      "A growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.",
      "Chinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.",
      "Nigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.",
      "But the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.",
      "Dundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.",
      "Numbers were also affected by visa restrictions.",
      "In order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.",
      "It also restricted visas for students' family dependents.",
      "The biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.",
      "These tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.",
      "Some international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.",
      "A further factor is that competition has been growing.",
      "The UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.",
      "That now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.",
      "What about spending?",
      "To increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.",
      "And with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.",
      "Ten years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.",
      "In 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.",
      "That level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.",
      "It becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "An external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.",
      "Its interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".",
      "Dundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.",
      "Subjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.",
      "Language departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.",
      "The Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.",
      "But money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.",
      "Dundee University to cut 632 jobs to plug \u00a335m deficit",
      "Edinburgh University to seek \u00a3140m in savings",
      "Record foreign student numbers at Scottish universities",
      "Some see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.",
      "Others see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.",
      "And there may be value in a crisis such as this.",
      "With a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.",
      "On funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.",
      "What comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.",
      "In the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.",
      "Scotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change."

      "The Lanarkshire singer's piano-led songs have seen him sell out gigs across the country and earn support slots with major bands.",
      "But he's decided to wait before bringing out any music so he can \"build a real fan base\".",

      "However, his unusual approach hasn't stopped him being backed by Lewis Capaldi, who has worked on a tune with the 18-year-old after a mutual connection in the music industry helped set up a collaboration between the two.",
      "\"Lewis has been absolutely class with me,\" he told BBC Scotland News.",
      "\"We met a few times and have now written a song together. When I was starting out I was covering his songs and now we're writing together - it's a bit mad to have people at that level interested in what I'm doing musically.\"",
      "Other than video clips shared on social media, no-one can hear Kerr's sensitive piano-led songs - a deliberate decision.",
      "\"I've seen so many artists on TikTok firing out a song a week but then not be selling out 200-capacity venues\", he explains.",
      "\"I'd rather sell out a tour than have a million streams on Spotify.  One thing that'll never change is that real people want to go see gigs so I've just done lots of shows and supported folk.",
      "\"We did two headlines in Glasgow, selling out King Tut's. Then it was Saint Lukes, which is double the size of Tut's, and then a UK tour. I spoke to a few people and decided to try to push it out further with another tour.\"",
      "That tour will end on Sunday at the Garage in Glasgow, his biggest hometown gig yet.",
      "He jokes most of the people coming to those gigs are family members, which gently plays down his growing popularity.",
      "However, he has had plenty of family backing, taking singing and piano lessons as a child and getting a taste of the arts by appearing in pantomimes as a youngster, treading the boards at the Pavillion theatre.",
      "It came naturally to someone who admits he was \"always the class clown\" at school, and enjoyed being the centre of attention.",
      "By the age of 10 he was singing at a local song club, performing a Queen track on his first appearance.",
      "His musical roots come from the school run, however.",
      "\"I was in primary school in Uddingston and my sister was in secondary at Uddingstoon Grammar, so I had half an hour to wait before my grandad picked her up. He had a Sam Cooke record that would just play and before I knew it, I had all the words off by heart.\"",
      "That led to a love of classic soul - Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Etta James - that Kerr says is \"imprinted\" in his music to this day.",

      "The advice of Stargazing singer Smith - the man with the best-selling British single in 2024 - has provided a big boost to Kerr, even if those words of wisdom are sometimes delivered tongue in cheek.",
      "\"I was home for Christmas and not sure what to do now that the tour was over. I got a message from Myles that simply read 'why don't you release a song, ya melt'.",
      "\"He's great though.  It's not like the support act is always chilling with the headliner,  but Myles was amazing about it. I was sitting in my dressing room and Myles burst in and was like 'why are you here, come have a beer with us' - then we would just sit talking about songs.\"",
      "He's now writing with an array of collaborators, and starting to record material with the aim of finally releasing songs later this year, adding that he's being a \"perfectionist\" about what should come out after such a wait.",
      "\"It's great fun too \u2013 you go for a day, write a song together and then go to the pub. There's not many jobs where you get put with two people you've never met, have a therapy session and then write a song about it.\"",

      "According to Education Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne, it is because the new illustrated version of the classic story was judged too grown-up for the 10 and 11 year-olds who would be reading it.",
      "But illustrator Julien Berjeaut \u2013 known as Jul \u2013 said the ministry's objections were spurious, and that he feared the book was pulled because the characters he portrayed in it were dark-skinned.",
      "\"The only reason I can think of [for the cancellation] is the disgust some people felt at seeing princes and princesses who look a bit more like actual schoolchildren of today,\" he told France's Le Monde newspaper.",

      "He added that it was \"as if [Donald] Trump and his team were in charge\".",
      "The original Beauty and the Beast was written by French authoress Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in the 18th century, and tells of a merchant's daughter, Belle, who must live with an ogre in order to save her father's life.",

      "According to a spokesperson at the ministry quoted by Le Figaro, \"the illustrations address themes which are unsuitable for children of that age \u2013 alcohol, social media, illegal trading and police checks.",
      "\"The father is an Algerian who drinks and does dodgy import-export. He's even arrested by police. Without explanation, this was bound to provoke a reaction from parents.\"",
      "The free book programme, which was launched seven years ago, is meant to encourage children to read at home, without the supervision of teachers or parents.",
      "According to Borne, \"Jul has a lot of talent.  He's good at irony, at not taking things at face value.  But without accompaniment, [the book] is not adapted to the age-group.\"",
      "The ministry said there had been several meetings with Jul at which officials had raised concerns about the progress of the work, but he had failed to take account of their objections.",
      "Oddly, in the last proofs of the book before it was withdrawn, the minister had actually added a preface, praising Jul's \"malicious touch and razor-sharp eye.\"",
      "The book will still be published, but not at the ministry's expense. French children this year will instead receive a version of Homer's Odyssey."

      "In a ruling issued on Wednesday, a US judge rejected the allegations of songwriter Adam Stone, who released a song with the same name in 1989. He accused Carey of  exploiting his \"popularity\" and \"style\".",
      "Mr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance, was claiming at least $20m (\u00a316m) in damages.",
      "But in her ruling, Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani cited expert testimony saying the two songs  simply shared \"Christmas song clich\u00e9s\" that were common to several earlier hits.",
      "Mr Stone and his lawyers had not \"met their burden of showing that [the songs by] Carey and Vance are substantially similar\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Almandi also ruled that Mr Stone and his lawyers should face sanctions for filing \"frivolous\" arguments, that included \"vague... and incomprehensible mixtures of factual assertions and conclusions, subjective opinions, and other irrelevant evidence\".",

      "The initial complaint was dropped in December 2022, but refiled a month later.",
      "Mr Stone had hoped to share in the song's runaway success. All I Want For Christmas Is You earns about $8.5 million (\u00a36.6 million) every year; and has spent 140 weeks in the UK's top 100.",
      "'No similarities'",
      "Carey's lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case last August, arguing that Mr Stone had failed to establish copyright infringement.",

    "summary": "The actor takes on the role of legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly - but insists it won't happen again.",
    "story": [
      "When Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success.",
      "There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan.",
      "\"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.",
      "\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\"",
      "Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus.",
      "The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book.",
      "The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced.",
      "\"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"",
      "The wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice.",
      "\" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says.",
      "\"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\"",
      "That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage.",
      "At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play.",
      "\"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"",
      "Born in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\".",
      "He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow.",
      "He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give.",
      "After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor.",
      "He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.",
      "More recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party.",
      "Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry.",
      "\"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea.",
      "\"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\"",
      "He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty).",
      "\"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"",
      "Normal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team.",
      "Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football.",
      "\"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\"",
      "It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive.",
      "\"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein \u2013 those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much.  Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism?",
      "\"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"",
      "He says he's delighted to be performing at the Royal Court, where audiences can tuck into a bowl of scouse in the auditorium before many of the shows. He says he's been told it compares with the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow.",
      "\"They let you know if they're getting bored. It's not bourgeois polite and that appeals to me.\"",
      "And he hopes it will appeal to fans of all football teams, and none.",
      "\"That's going to be the big test. My kids have a passing acquaintance. My boy is into football but my girls are not massively into it so it will be fascinating to see how they relate to it.\"",
      "And given his views on the low wages of subsidised theatre, and the fact that his family are coming to Liverpool to see the show, can we assume he won't be treading the boards again soon?",
      "\"No, it's a one-off for me. I can't afford it. The show might tour but with a 52-strong cast, I'm not sure if anyone can afford it.\"",
      "Red or Dead is at Liverpool's Royal Court from March 21st until April 19th."

      "Kalki's letter is addressed to her five-year-old daughter. In it, she offers advice for navigating pressures around body image and describes the ways unrealistic beauty standards have affected her personally.",
      "The actor, who lives in Goa in India with her husband Israeli musician Guy Hershberg and their daughter, says the inspiration for the letter came to her when, one day after school, the child came to her to say she didn't feel pretty.",
      "\"When they're so young, they're so perfect and you think, 'Oh my goodness. How is it possible that you could think you're not pretty?!'\" she says on the podcast.",

      "Born in Puducherry, India, to French parents, Kalki describes herself as a \"geeky introvert\" while growing up. As a teenager, she says, she was uncomfortable with her appearance, and pursuing a career on camera only intensified those feelings.",

      "Working in the film industry, she says she experienced a particular pressure to maintain a youthful appearance. Once, she says, a producer even suggested over lunch that she get dermal fillers for her wrinkles.",
      "\"He said, 'All you need is a little filler for your laughter lines.' I smiled and said, 'Well, I better stop smiling so much.' So I think my approach has been to deal with it with humour.\"",
      "Kalki says this happened when she was in her 30s and that she'd \"already lived enough life to not be affected\".",
      "\"But I know that 20-year-olds are being told this and they feel the pressure to go and change their face very early on.\"",
      "Kalki says she believes this pressure is worsened by the rise of social media. \"We all scrutinise [ourselves] and we all have these filters.\" And in her letter, she shares her fears of trying to protect her daughter from such scrutiny.",
      "She jokes that she even wondered about moving to Australia when she heard of the country's plans to ban smartphones for under-16s. \"That's how my mother-brain is working!\"",
      "Kalki is not the only celebrity to speak about the pressure to appear young that is faced by women in the public eye.",
      "Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown made headlines earlier this month for calling out journalists who have criticised the way she has aged.",
      "\"The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices is disturbing,\" the 21-year-old said in a three-minute video on her Instagram page.",
      "Dear Daughter podcast is the brainchild of Namulanta Kombo, a mother from Nairobi on a quest to create a \"handbook to life\" for her daughter, through the advice of parents from all over the world.",

      "Kalki's letter",
      "Dear daughter,",
      "One day after school you told me, \"Maman I'm not pretty.\" You were only four. I panicked and immediately responded with, \"What do you mean, of course you're pretty, you're as pretty as a butterfly, as bright as the sun.'' And you continued to say angrily, \"I'm not, I'm just not.\"",
      "In retrospect, I wish I had listened to you and been curious enough to ask you why you didn't feel pretty? You see I make mistakes too, my own insecurities and need to protect you took over and I didn't allow you the space to feel what you were feeling. Don't let others decide who you are. Not even me. You have far more experience at being you than anyone else. And no-one else can be a better you than you.",
      "Thankfully, I get second chances at being a better mother, and when a few weeks later you said \"I don't like myself\", I stopped my impulse to tell you what you were and listened. There was some silence and then you opened up about how you were having a hard time with some other children in school.",
      "I thought about how to ensure you know that beauty is not skin deep. The truth is sometimes you will feel ugly. I feel ugly sometimes even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful. And so now I have made it a point to tell you how beautiful you are, not when you're feeling bad about the way you look, and not when you're dressed your best, but when you are being the best versions of you.",
      "As you grow older I know that you will not always believe that you're beautiful because we live in a social world that has distorted beauty, that has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour, or a certain shape. These beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently.",
      "Remember that you are whole and that if you start to pick apart your little nose or your hairy brows or your not quite right ears, you will start to feel ugly, but that is only because you are forgetting the whole. An elephant is a beautiful animal, but pick it apart and it's got a long wrinkly nose, strange side glancing eyes, huge sticking out ears and a big fat stomach.",
      "Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life, they are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs, they are your friends for life.",
      "Dear daughter, do you know when I'll stop loving you? Never.",

    "story": [
      "British film critics have mostly panned Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, while US reviewers have been somewhat more positive.",
      "Chief film critic for The Times, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film \"mostly captivating\".",
      "Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role.",
      "Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%.",
      "The mostly good",
      "US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson.",
      "But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs.",
      "The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future.",
      "Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\"",
      "Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\"",
      "He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\".",
      "He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".",
      "Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\".",
      "Robbie Collin from The Telegraph gave the film a respectable three stars.",
      "\"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets \u2013 the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft \u2013 it really picks up,\" he said.",
      "He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\".",
      "The not so good",
      "Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner giving the film two stars.",
      "\"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says.",
      "He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\".",
      "Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.",
      "\"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.",
      "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\".",
      "He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\".",
      "The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet.",
      "He added: \"The new tunes, much like Zegler's performance, are watery and ineffectual, while the dramatic jeopardy is non-existent.",
      "\"It's hard not to see this as anything other than a crisis point for Disney, a studio that used to make flawless cinematic stories but now infantilises global audiences with sanctimonious life lessons culled from the corpses of their own murdered movies\".",
      "Tickets for the film, which reportedly cost more than $270m (\u00a3217m) to make, have only been put on presale in the last two weeks, relatively late for a big Disney film.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent gave it one star, declaring that \"Rachel Zegler deserves better than the lazy, visually repellent Snow White\".",
      "\"What's most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney's choices have become. With Snow White, they've finessed their formula \u2013 do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices,\" she concluded.",

    "summary": "With five massive stadium shows this summer, K-Pop is establishing itself in the UK mainstream.",
    "story": [
      "Six years ago, Amber Clare was a devoted One Direction fan.",
      "Scrolling through Twitter for information about the band's solo projects, she saw a reply that said \"Listen to Icy by Itzy\".",
      "Intrigued, she clicked on the link. It changed her life.",
      "\"I'd never listened to K-Pop before that point but I immediately became a fan,\" she says.",
      "\"And now Itzy is the reason I have my job.\"",
      "Today, Clare is the marketing and social media manager for K-Stars, the UK's first and biggest shop devoted to Korean pop music.",
      "Based in Manchester, it started as a small business in Manchester's Affleck's Palace in 2019.",
      "\"You'd order things by PayPal, and then the CEO would pack them up by himself and ship everything out,\" Clare recalls.",
      "Now it's a two-storey emporium, based on Deansgate, with a staff of more than 20 dedicated K-Pop enthusiasts.",
      "It's a sign of how the genre has exploded in the UK, even though radio and television has largely shunned all but the biggest acts, like BTS, aespa and Blackpink.",
      "\"It's still kind of a niche - but it's not a small niche,\" says Clare. \"In my head I'm the only Itzy fan, but when I went to see them in concert, it was sold out.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wow, where have all you people been hiding?'\"",
      "In fact, the UK is now among the top 10 countries that follow K-Pop on Spotify, with the boyband Ateez placing two records in the top five of the UK album charts last year.",
      "This summer, Blackpink will play two nights at Wembley Stadium, with Stray Kids pulling off the same feat in Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Twickenham Stadium will say \"anyong haseyo\" to one of K-pop's longest-running festivals.",
      "Established in 2008, the SM Town Live festival is a showcase for artists signed to the SM Entertainment Label, one of the industry's key players.",
      "To celebrate the company\u2019s 30th anniversary, they're transplanting the event from Seoul to Middlesex.",
      "\"It's essentially a multi-day festival all in one, because you've got so many artists all at the same venue, jam packed into the space of three or four hours,\" says Reese Carter, of boyband Dear Alice, who'll be among the performers in Twickenham.",
      "\"It's non-stop. You've got to prep yourself, because you'll definitely want to dance.\"",
      "\"It's very down to earth but it goes straight to your heart,\" adds Ten from K-Pop group WayV.",
      "Targeting the UK",
      "SM holds a unique place in Korea's musical history. Founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man, it is widely credited with establishing the K-Pop template.",
      "It was the first company to introduce the trainee system, where young talent goes through intensive training that lasts months, or even years, before making their \"debut\".",
      "And it dominated what's known as the \"first generation\" of K-Pop idols, with bands like H.O.T. and S.E.S.",
      "The Twickenham show will pay tribute to that three-decade journey, with a line-up that includes everyone from Red Velvet, EXO and Girl's Generation to current chart-toppers like aespa, Riize and all of the sub-units of boyband NCT - which boasts more than 20 members.",
      "\"That's very rare,\" says Ten, one of the group's most recognisable (and chatty) stars.",
      "\"The last time we had an NCT concert as a whole was two years ago. It's so difficult to schedule every group to be in the same spot at the same time.\"",
      "But that's not all. The concert will also feature what's been billed as \"a group of promising trainees\", known for now as SMTR25 \u2013 showcasing the future of the label.",
      "\"Performing alongside the senior artists we've admired since our trainee days, as well as our talented junior artists, makes this an incredibly meaningful experience for us,\" said aespa in an email to the BBC.",
      "The hope is that shows like this will open a few doors - because, for all the strides K-Pop has made in the last couple of years, bands have consistently prioritised America over Europe.",
      "It's a logical step. The US is the world's biggest music market, so it offers more opportunities for touring and merchandise sales, while an MTV Award performance or a concert for NPR's Tiny Desk series travels further internationally than an appearance at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The situation here isn't as good as what the American industry gets,\" acknowledges Amber Clare.",
      "\"Every single K-Pop group, if they announce a world tour, America will always be on the map - but European countries are always left wondering if they're going to be included or not.\"",
      "Things are changing, though.",
      "In a crowded market, labels are increasingly turning their attention to the UK \u2013 where the anglophone media has international reach, and there's a baked-in affection for boy and girl groups like Take That, Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.",
      "To make inroads, bands have teamed up with some of Britain's biggest artists.",
      "Aespa's 2023 single Better Things was co-written by Raye, while Le Sserafim collaborated with PinkPantheress on club anthem Crazy and with Jungle on their latest song, Come Over.",
      "Last year, SM went one further \u2013 creating a British boyband and putting them through the K-Pop machinery.",
      "That group was Dear Alice, whose gruelling traineeship was documented in BBC series Made In Korea.",
      "Having survived the process, the five-piece finally premiered their debut single, Ariana, at a massive SM Town concert in Seoul in January.",
      "\"These shows are timed down to the second,\" says singer Blaise Noon. \"When we got our time to go on stage, it was literally like, 8:30 and 48 seconds. It just shows how so well thought out is.\"",
      "Bringing the production to London is evidence that SM has its sights trained on the UK, he confirms.",
      "\"In the UK, we produce some really amazing boy groups, so I think we have that connection in the culture. So I think they definitely want to hit it. I can see it getting bigger and bigger every day.\"",
      "Ten, who releases a new solo album, Stunner, next week, says he's already experienced the devotion of UK fans.",
      "When his group WayV last visited England in 2023, \"we were surprised that people could sing along to our songs, because we sing in Chinese\", he says.",
      "\"This opportunity with SM Town, I feel like it's going to open a bigger market for K-Pop in the UK.",
      "\"I hope so, because I'd like to come and perform my solo stuff to my UK fans too.\"",
      "The opportunity is there.",
      "Nine of the 10 best-selling albums in the world last year were by South Korean artists, illustrating the music's broad appeal - but none of those records charted in the UK\u2019s Top 50.",
      "Lack of radio exposure is one factor - but listeners can also be put off by clunky English lyrics or the sudden-but-deliberate stylistic shifts that characterise K-Pop.",
      "If you're willing to dig into the genre, though, you can find some of the most audacious and indelible hooks music has to offer.",
      "One by-product of K-pop\u2019s (relative) obscurity is the bond it creates among fans. There's a sense of belonging that comes from discovering and nurturing your \"bias\", outside the glare of the mainstream.",
      "It\u2019s a relationship bands foster by a fire hose stream of social media content, where dance challenges, video diaries and photoshoots are posted daily.",
      "Dear Alice experienced the impact of that effort at a UK meet-and-greet last weekend.",
      "\"It felt like we were hanging out with a bunch of our mates,\" says Dexter Greenwood.",
      "\"They were just cool people,\" adds James Sharp. \"We're starting to recognise faces and remember people on this journey - and I think there's going to be more and more.\"",
      "By the time they play Twickenham in June, the group promise to have more new music to showcase.",
      "In the meantime, though, they want to introduce their labelmates to some of the UK's finer customs.",
      "\"We've got to order a bunch of Greggs for the SM family,\" says Noon.",

    "summary": "The BBC hears how five raiders escaped with a \u00a34.8m gold toilet, as told by Blenheim Palace staff.",
    "story": [
      "In the early hours of 14 September 2019, Eleanor Paice jolted awake to the sound of smashing glass.",
      "Living in a staff flat above Blenheim Palace, the guest services supervisor was used to strange noises. But when fire alarms began to blare, she knew something was wrong.",
      "She quickly began evacuating to the great courtyard. But unbeknown to her, she was running straight into the final moments of an audacious heist.",
      "Five men had smashed their way into the palace, ripped out a \u00a34.8m solid gold toilet and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.",
      "The working loo, entitled America, had been on display for just two days at the 18th Century stately home, plumbed in as part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "Now, more than five years on, a total of three men have been convicted in connection to the heist.",
      "James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024, while Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday.",
      "Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, was cleared of the same charge.",
      "It was a crime that intrigued art lovers, delighted the press and coined countless potty-themed puns.",
      "Now, the BBC has gained exclusive behind-the-scenes access to staff at Blenheim Palace to understand the heist and security failures from their perspective.",
      "'We've been hit'",
      "It was the night before, Blenheim chief executive Dominic Hare was at a glamorous exhibition launch party being held at the palace, hosted by Cattelan himself.",
      "It was America's first time on display outside of New York and the artwork's presence was creating a buzz.",
      "He remembers slipping away from the festivities, hoping for a turn on the fully usable toilet. But when confronted with a line, he told himself \"that's okay, there's no point queuing. You can come back tomorrow and have a look\".",
      "But just a few hours later, his colleague Ms Paice was witnessing the final moments as the 98kg (216lbs) artwork was being heaved into a boot.",
      "She recalls a confusing and fast-moving scene: \"It was just shadows and quick movement. I just saw them move towards the car, get in the car\u2026.and then the car just sped straight off.\"",
      "From the burglars entering and exiting the courtyard, the audacious heist had taken just five minutes.",
      "Gang guilty over \u00a34.8m gold toilet heist",
      "CCTV of theft of \u00a34.8m gold toilet shown in court",
      "Man pleads guilty to golden toilet palace theft",
      "Police arrived shortly after, and it was only when staff searched the palace they realised what had been stolen.",
      "\"That was when... I felt my stomach drop,\" Ms Paice says. \"And I thought, this is big.\"",
      "Soon, the chief executive's phone was buzzing him awake: \"Dom, we've been hit.\"",
      "He said it took him a few moments to realise he was not dreaming before rushing to the palace.",
      "His relief that staff were unharmed then mingled with the horror of a flooded, shattered crime scene.",
      "\"If the golden toilet in situ had looked beautiful and perfect and majestic and untainted, this was the total opposite,\" Mr Hare said. \"This was brutalised, smashed up. This is a palace. Palaces don't get smashed up\".",
      "When the palace reopened a day later, the controversy was addressed with a theatrical flourish.",
      "Staff re-strung police tape across the shattered cubicle, just metres from the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, and exhibited the crime scene as part of the now toilet-less Cattelan show.",
      "Mr Hare said despite his embarrassment, his anger had prompted him to keep it visible but he also realised it could be a draw to the public.",
      "It worked. In the following days Ms Paice said the palace was \"slammed\", with hordes wanting to glimpse the destruction.",
      "\"People were more interested to see where the golden toilet had been stolen from than to come and see the golden toilet itself,\" she added.",
      "Security failures",
      "Palace staff say they did see the humour in how the press and public approached the crime, but they were still deeply rattled by the raid.",
      "Ms Paice said Blenheim, a safe and secure home for her, did not feel \"settled in the same way\" for a long time.",
      "\"There was always this anxiousness. If that's happened, anything could happen,\" she said.",
      "Mr Hare said he felt both emotional and grateful no-one was harmed, calling the burglars the \"most dangerous people who'd ever visited Blenheim Palace\".",
      "\"That toilet survived New York City. And if it survived New York City, it should have survived Blenheim Palace,\" says Christopher Marinello, an art recovery lawyer brought in by insurers to look at the case.",
      "In his view, Blenheim's security \"failed miserably\".",
      "What is strikingly clear from interviews with palace staff, the 18-carat gold toilet had not been deemed a security risk.",
      "A month before the burglary, Edward Spencer-Churchill, the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, told the Sunday Times: \"It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick.",
      "\"Firstly, it's plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don't plan to be guarding it.\"",
      "Mr Hare said they were \"far more worried\" about other controversial artworks in the exhibition - a statue of a meteor-struck pope, union flags the public walked on and a statue of a praying Adolf Hitler.",
      "He admitted the toilet's status as a quirky art object had eclipsed the fact it was worth \u00a32.8m in gold alone.",
      "It was left unguarded during closing hours, with no CCTV monitoring the cubicle door.",
      "But the gang exploited other security flaws that night, including no patrols and easily breached gates.",
      "Even after the raid, staff did not immediately realise the toilet had been the target.",
      "Ms Paice says she fleetingly imagined they had come for Churchill's childhood lock of hair, which the palace displays.",
      "'Not vulnerable anymore'",
      "In the weeks that followed, Mr Hare was motivated to overhaul security at top speed.",
      "He took full responsibility for the failures that night.",
      "\"It's not a democratic decision that we had a certain level of security, it was really mine. In that sense I made Blenheim vulnerable. And we are not vulnerable anymore,\" he said.",
      "The palace has seen its security overhauled with a \"very significant upgrade\", while it has also been a wake-up call for other stately homes.",
      "The stolen gold has never been recovered but the story will live on as a quirky footnote in the history of one of Britain's most popular palaces.",
      "\"There's big and serious history here, wars which changed the course of history on a continent. Put it against that, it's small fry,\" Mr Hare remarked.",
      "\"[But] in the histories of the normal people of Blenheim, the people who've lived here and breathed life into this place, it was a very threatening moment.",
      "\"I can imagine guides in 150 years' time, it's the sort of story they might refer to.\"",
      "Gang guilty over \u00a34.8m gold toilet heist",

    "summary": "Herbie Hancock on 80 years of playing the piano and being this year's recipient of the Polar Music Prize.",
    "story": [
      "Herbie Hancock is an all-time jazz great, so it is reassuring to hear that he suffers from the same modern day procrastination problems as the rest of us mere mortals.",
      "\"I fall into rabbit holes on YouTube. A lot of them. New music writing software, things about health, tech things.\"",
      "That is his explanation as to why he has not made an album for 15 years.",
      "\"I get victimised by it, so to speak, but that's life,\" he chuckles.",
      "Speaking from his house in west Hollywood, the ridiculously sprightly 84-year-old pianist has never been afraid to embrace technology, but normally he is the one doing the mastering, not vice versa.",
      "Hancock's half century... and more",
      "Discovered by trumpeter Donald Byrd at the start of the 60s, Hancock signed to Blue Note Records, and wrote jazz standards including Watermelon Man, Cantaloupe Island and Maiden Voyage.",
      "In the 70s he was an early adopter of synthesisers, blending genres with the electro-funk classic Head Hunters.",
      "In the 80s, he had a bona fide worldwide hit single with Rockit after embracing turntablism and scratching, winning five awards at the first ever MTV Awards for its classic dancing robots video.",
      "Deee Lite's Groove Is in the Heart? The riff that drives that song is a sample from Hancock's Blow-Up soundtrack. Madonna, Janet Jackson and NWA are among the plethora of performers to have incorporated his music into their own.",
      "As recently as 2008, he beat Amy Winehouse and Kanye West to win his first album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "The reason we are talking is that Hancock has been announced as one of the recipients of this year's Polar Music Prize, the closest music has to a Nobel prize.",
      "Previous laureates have included Sir Paul McCartney, Dizzy Gillespie, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Quincy Jones.",
      "\"It's a huge, fantastic list of people I've admired,\" says Hancock before expressing particular delight that the saxophonist Wayne Shorter was chosen for the honour in 2017, six years before his death. Together they made up two fifths of Miles Davis's Second Great Quintet.",
      "Working with Miles Davis",
      "Joy comes over Hancock's face when reminiscing about the period between 1964 to 1968, when he toured the world with the man Rolling Stone magazine called \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time\".",
      "\"I was always frightened playing with Miles,\" he laughs.",
      "\"It was very intimidating. I always wanted to be at my best, because I admired him so much. He was such a big part in my own development as a musician.",
      "\"It was fear on one hand. On the other hand, it was exciting. And when things were at their best, it was really inspiring. When were all in sync, that made life worth living.\"",
      "On the pianist's favourite distraction, YouTube, there is a clip that has been viewed almost five million times, showing a furious Davis, on stage in Milan in 1964, stopping his improvised solo to send dagger eyes at Hancock.",
      "Online there is much debate as to what caused this trumpet temper tantrum. But for Hancock, this was a regular occurrence.",
      "\"A lot of times I would be surprised at what would upset Miles, what would make him a little angry. I didn't always know. He was not always easy to figure out, so I got used to that slight discomfort,\" he says grinning.",
      "\"That's life. But I was always looking to learn from those discomforts.\"",
      "And when he embarks on his European tour this summer, which includes three UK dates at London's Barbican, Hancock will be thinking about another lesson he learnt from Davis - this one about the make-up of his audience.",
      "He adopts a low, deep whispering voice and does a full-on Miles Davis impression, recreating the conversation from the mid 1960s, when the trumpeter gave him a stern warning: \"If all you see are dudes in the audience, that means your music is dead.\"",
      "Herbie Hancock is pretending to be Miles Davis to an audience of me. It is a glorious moment.",
      "\"He used more expletives than I just did,\" Hancock chortles. \"But you get the idea,\" clearly enjoying his mimicry as much as I did.",
      "Hancock has been playing the piano for almost 80 years, but the instrument still gives him so much joy, that on occasion, during a session on the keys, he finds himself sobbing.",
      "\"If I've solved some kind of problem that I've had with the tune and made some kind of discovery that surpassed my expectations, I've been known to cry, to have tears coming down my face.\"",
      "I ask what kind of problem leaves him reaching for Herbie hankies.",
      "\"It's difficult to explain,\" he responds, \"But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?'\"",
      "It feels like we have been invited inside Hancock's brain and are seeing the cogs turn. At speed.",
      "He continues: \"There may be something that I want to connect, but all the ways I know of connecting them are not the solution. And I have to find some other means.",
      "\"And sometimes that [means] can come from looking at it in a different way. And not necessarily through music.\"",
      "This answer goes a long way to explaining the difference between someone who is a musical genius and someone who is not.",
      "Hancock went to college to study electrical engineering, so it is no surprise that he has taken a huge interest in the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "He believes our fears about the technology are overblown, and says he prefers to \"embrace it\". Hancock acknowledges concerns that AI lacks an ethical framework but asks: \"Who are the worst examples of understanding ethics and being able to live a life with ethics? We, human beings, we're the worst, right?\"",
      "He is on a roll now.",
      "\"I have this feeling that AI is going to help us all understand and get closer to becoming more ethically responsible people that are helping each other, instead of hurting or killing each other. Helping the planet instead of killing the planet with environmental issues.\"",
      "And the man who once released an album called Future Shock, has some simple advice for us all.",
      "\"When I'm using ChatGPT or Siri on my iPhone, I always say thank you and they usually say, 'You're welcome.'\"",
      "\"I try to treat AI like it's human and it actually manifests itself in an extremely positive way and that makes me feel better.\"",
      "At the age of 84, Herbie Hancock is still determined to try and future-proof himself, by getting the robots on his side.",
      "Finally, I ask him a question on behalf of parents all round the world. My 11-year-old Charlie loves playing the piano, but hates practising. What advice would he give anyone in that situation?",
      "He nods.",
      "\"I understand your pain. I don't like practising either.\"",
      "Hancock, pauses and thinks before adding: \"But you know, I look at it as, 'OK, this is something, even if I don't want to do it, I need to do it.' And once I get into it, then I feel like I've conquered an obstacle in my life.\"",
      "He pauses again, before concluding: \"I don't always win that battle, but I've gotten to this point. So I guess I didn't lose a lot of battles.\"",
      "And has he practised today?",
      "\"No. I didn't today. And I probably won't.\"",
      "Once again he laughs, and with that he departs, ready for the rest of the day and to watch some more YouTube.",
      "Herbie Hancock will be presented with the Polar Music Prize  in Stockholm, Sweden on 27 May 2025."

    "summary": "The coroner at newborn baby Ida Lock's inquest highlights eight opportunities that were missed.",
    "story": [
      "A newborn baby died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care, a coroner has ruled.",
      "Ida Lock was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019 but died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen.",
      "After a five-week inquest at Preston County Hall, coroner James Adeley concluded that Ida's death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said there had been eight missed opportunities \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "The inquest heard that Ida was transferred to the intensive care unit at Royal Preston Hospital's neonatal unit, where she died on 16 November 2019.",
      "The hearing previously heard that an April 2020 report from the independent Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) had identified numerous failings in Ida's care which had contributed to her death.",
      "The review said midwives failed to identify an abnormally slow foetal heart rate after Ida's mother, Sarah Robinson, attended in early labour.",
      "After Ida was born there was ineffective resuscitation, the HSIB concluded.",
      "But an earlier internal \"root cause analysis\" from the hospital in January 2020 found no issues and praised the \"great cohesion and communication\" shown by staff in the delivery suite.",
      "After reading the \"night and day\" contrasting reports, Ida's parents Ms Robinson and Ryan Lock complained to University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT), which runs the hospital.",
      "'Wholly incompetent'",
      "Delivering his conclusion, Dr Adeley, said: \"Ida was a normal child whose death was caused by a lack of oxygen during her delivery that occurred due to the gross failure of the three midwives attending her to provide basic medical care to deliver Ida urgently when it was apparent she was in distress.\"",
      "And he noted that her death was contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent\" failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation during the first three-and-half minutes of her life.",
      "This, he said, further contributed to the infant's brain damage.",
      "The senior coroner also criticised the hospital's investigation into Ida's death, calling it a \"damning indictment of an ineffective, dysfunctional and callous system that has failed this family at every opportunity\".",
      "UHMBT was the subject of a damning report in 2015 that found a \"lethal mix\" of problems at another of its maternity units at Furness General Hospital that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013.",
      "The Morecambe Bay investigation, chaired by Dr Bill Kirkup, uncovered a series of failures \"at every level\", from the unit itself to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust.",
      "In a statement, Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer of UHMBT, said: \"Losing a child is tragic and our heartfelt condolences go out to Ida's parents, family and loved ones. We are truly sorry for the distress we have caused.",
      "\"We accept that we failed Ida and her family and if we had done some things differently and sooner, Ida would still be here today.",
      "\"We also acknowledge the additional upset caused to Ida's parents and family as a result of the way investigations into Ida's death have been conducted since 2019.",
      "\"For that, we are truly sorry.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest.",
      "\"We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",

      "The most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly.",
      "The ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again.",

      "In one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).",
      "The man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021.",
      "A scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.",
      "However, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.",
      "The patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home.",
      "Later that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body.",
      "Just months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain.",
      "The ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions.",

      "\"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\"",
      "A statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made.",
      "\"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\"",
      "The trust has also agreed to pay the family \u00a34,000, as recommended by PHSO.",
      "'My brother believed NHS was best place'",
      "In another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise.",
      "The patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday.",
      "His brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it.",
      "\"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\"",
      "The man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.",
      "However, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.",
      "He died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.",
      "If the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.",
      "While the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.",
      "His brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"",

      "Ms Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care.",
      "\"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\"",
      "The 2021 ombudsman report into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\".",
      "It is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added.",

      "Caroline Stickland, the charity's chief executive, told the BBC: \"We really welcome this clear call to action that the current state of transport inaccessibility in this country can not continue.\"",
      "\"This report is a wakeup call for the government to address transport accessibility and make sure the UK is a place for all of us.\"",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Panorama Covid had led to a \"serious and profound shift\" in attitudes to attendance. She said lockdowns had cast \"a long shadow\" over the life chances of the youngest children.",
      "The latest statistics for persistent absence show 15% of primary children in England have missed at least one in ten days of school this school year - up from about 8% before Covid.",
      "It comes as the gap between the poorest students and other pupils had mainly narrowed before the pandemic, following years of effort by schools.",

      "Incapacity benefits under universal credit to be halved for new claimants",
      "Incapacity benefits under universal credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at \u00a397 per week from April next year - this means they will not be increased in line with inflation until 2029/30.",

      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",

      "Pip is now the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending expected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",

    "story": [
      "Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a \"desperate situation\" at the time.",
      "In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\".",
      "He said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\".",
      "At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic.",
      "'Radically short of PPE'",
      "Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment.",
      "He defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward.",
      "The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.",
      "\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.",
      "\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"",
      "The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant.",
      "Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\".",
      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",

    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

      "In her autumn Budget, Reeves increased the levels of tax and public spending significantly \u2013 paid for largely through extra taxes on businesses which proved highly controversial.",
      "But she is now under pressure on several fronts. It emerged on Friday that government borrowing \u2013 the difference between its spending and its income from taxes \u2013 was even higher than expected in February.",
      "The official prediction for that month from the Office for Budget Responsibility was \u00a36.5 billion, but it hit \u00a310.7bn, leaving the chancellor with less fiscal headroom.",
      "Adding to the Treasury's in-tray, official growth forecasts for the economy are also likely to be cut.",
      "Last week, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030 and creating a more \"pro-work system\", though ministers have not set out the breakdown of forecast savings.",
      "The changes will affect people claiming disability and health benefits, as well as those aged under 22 relying on top-up payments while on universal credit.",
      "The chancellor will set out the impact of these changes in more detail in her Spring Statement, and is expected to announce further cuts \u2013 this time to some Whitehall departments \u2013 to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.",
      "The Treasury has reiterated that these rules \u2013 to not borrow for funding day-to-day public spending and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economy by 2029-30 - are \"non-negotiable\" .",
      "\"What I've done so far is put money into public services,\" Reeves insisted in her BBC interview.",
      "She said there was \"real growth\" in spending for each of the next few years \"but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly\".",
      "But Labour grandee Lord Blunkett wants Reeves to \"loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", calling them \"Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster on Saturday, the former work and pensions secretary under Tony Blair said he would \"raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15bn\" to help fund \"a new deal for the unemployed, getting half a million of those young people who are out of work and training into a job or a training programme\".",
      "Reeves spoke to me earlier this week amid unease among Labour MPs at the welfare changes.",
      "In the interview, she opened up on how the job is going so far following a number of controversies not only over her decisions, but also over the accuracy of parts of her CV.",
      "Asked whether she had been treated fairly, and in the same way as her male predecessors, Reeves told me: \"I think that would be up to others to judge and people to judge over time.",
      "\"I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers' money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job.",

      "Policies include stricter tests for personal independence payments (Pip), which will affect hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits in cash terms at \u00a397 per week until 2029/30.",
      "The prime minister has also announced NHS England will be scrapped, along with some other arms-length government bodies.",
      "But aside from spending cuts, the government has said it will increase defence spending, though the funds are being reallocated from the international aid budget.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said the latest borrowing figures were \"yet another major blow to the Chancellor's faltering plan for growth, and show her approach is simply not working\".",
      "She added National Insurance increases for employers, set to come into effect in April, would \"hammer small businesses\".",

      "In the messages, which were sent after Lowe criticised the Reform leader in a Daily Mail interview, Farage accused him of \"damaging the party just before elections\".",
      "Reform has always denied there was any connection between Lowe's suspension and his criticism of the party.",

      "Reform said it had also received allegations of bullying in Lowe's MP offices. Lowe strongly denies all the allegations.",
      "He has since accused Farage of a \"malicious witch hunt\" and being motivated \"to remove me because I dared to ask questions\".",

      "When it was suggested the investigation into Lowe was a response to his criticism of the leadership, Farage replied on WhatsApp: \"We are definitely damaged and within two weeks of nominations. Awful.\"",

      "The High Court has thrown out an attempt by the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon to challenge his jail conditions that have seen him segregated from other inmates.",
      "Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, argued that segregation at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, was destroying his mental health and breaching his human rights.",
      "Mr Justice Chamberlain said there was no evidence the state was trying to \"break\" him and the court has heard he was being segregated for his own safety as he had a \"mark [put] on his head\" by other inmates.",
      "The judge said Yaxley-Lennon's claims of degrading treatment fell far short of the evidence needed for the courts to intervene on human rights grounds.",
      "Prison governors had segregated Yaxley-Lennon, who is from Luton and led the now defunct anti-Islamic English Defence League (EDL), after concluding other inmates posed a threat and at least one may have been planning to try to kill him.",
      "The activist was jailed for 18 months in October after admitting breaching a court order which had directed him not to repeat lies about a Syrian refugee.",
      "Yaxley-Lennon was first held in HMP Belmarsh in south-east London - but he was moved after the jail received a large volume of abusive and racist emails, including threats to the governor, who is a black woman.",
      "On 1 November, Yaxley-Lennon entered a closed wing at Woodhill and has been kept apart from other prisoners, but has contact throughout the day with officers and staff.",

      "On Thursday, Alisdair Williamson KC, for Yaxley-Lennon, told the High Court his client had a complex form of post-traumatic stress disorder, exacerbated by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",
      "He argued his client's mental health would deteriorate and, upon his release on licence in July, he might return to substance abuse to cope.",
      "That disclosure was a rare court admission from Yaxley-Lennon that he has been a habitual drug user.",
      "Lawyers for the justice secretary said the segregation was neither solitary confinement or a punishment - but a carefully considered plan to keep Yaxley-Lennon safe.",
      "Prison governors said two prisoners had been planning to assault him to \"gain kudos and notoriety\".",
      "Another tip-off suggested that an inmate serving a life sentence would kill Yaxley-Lennon if they were ever placed on the same wing.",

      "\"On the contrary, all the evidence shows [the decision] was taken for his own protection and in the interests of preserving the safety of other prisoners and staff,\" he added.",
      "\"He himself had said, when first detained at HMP Belmarsh, that he had a conflict with the followers of Islam.",
      "\"It was thus understandable the governor should be concerned that Mr Yaxley-Lennon's presence might foment unrest or violence between Muslim and non-Muslim prisoners.\"",
      "The court heard there was no evidence Yaxley-Lennon was at risk of self-harm or suicide.",
      "The judge ruled the inmate's situation could not be classed as solitary confinement and did not amount to degrading treatment that would be an unlawful breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.",
      "The judge said his segregation was ameliorated by him being allowed \"some three hours per day out of his cell, which is more than twice the time allowed to convicted prisoners held in segregation\".",
      "The judge also said Robinson was allowed to use the gym and shower every day, work (\"albeit still on his own\"), and he could speak to prison officers, healthcare staff and the chaplaincy daily, as well as having a weekly Bible study session.",
      "He added that Yaxley-Lennon's claims he was being denied contact with friends and family were \"manifestly not well-founded\".",
      "Some 120 people have been authorised to see him in 93 visits - more than any other inmate, the court heard.",
      "He had two hours for visits four times a week and cancellations had related to suspected attempts by his supporters to orchestrate social media campaigning relating to his imprisonment.",
      "Yaxley-Lennon's High Court case had meant that an unrelated prosecution, for allegedly refusing to comply with a counter-terrorism search of his phone, had been put back months.",

      "The Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.",
      "The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",

      "\"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",

      "Cancer screenings have been missed and criminal convictions overlooked because of how data is collected about people's biological sex and gender identity, an independent review found.",
      "The review, led by Prof Alice Sullivan, outlined the risks of conflating biological sex and gender when it comes to clinical care, sex-specific cancer screening and safeguarding.",
      "Prof Sullivan, a professor of sociology at University College London, urged public bodies to collect data on both sex and gender identity by default \"across the board\" to ensure it is accurate.",
      "The Department of Health said the findings would be considered with \"the gravity they deserve, as it reforms gender identity services across the board\".",
      "Prof Sullivan said \"a confusion between sex and transgender and gender diverse identities\" had developed in recent years and there had been attempts to \"merge these two things into one variable\".",
      "While people can legally change gender, they can't change biological sex. This means a woman who transitions to become a man may still need cervical smears and transgender women may need prostate checks.",
      "Prof Sullivan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there is no reason for a \"trade off\" between recording data on sex and gender.",
      "\"What I've argued in this report is that sex is really important, we should be recording it by default - transgender and gender diverse identities can also be recorded where that's appropriate,\" she said.",
      "\"There's no reason to see this as a trade-off between the two. They're two distinct variables.\"",
      "The report, commissioned by the previous Conservative government in February of last year, also raised concerns about policing as suspects do not have to tell officers that they have changed their name or gender.",
      "It is possible someone could be released from custody before their offending history is known about, the review said.",
      "The report recommends that police forces record data on sex in their systems and stop allowing changes to be made to individual sex markers on the police national computer.",
      "It also said new NHS numbers and changed gender markers should no longer be issued.",
      "She urged the government to implement the recommendations \"across the board\".",
      "\"I've recommended that data on sex should be collected by default in all research and data collection commissioned by government and quasi-governmental organisations, and I think implementing that would make a huge difference,\" she said.",

      "A government spokesperson said: \"This government is clear that the collection of accurate and relevant data is vital in research and the operation of effective public services, particularly when it comes to sex.\"",
      "The review has been shared with the Office for National Statistics and other departments, the spokesperson added.",

    "story": [
      "Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a \"desperate situation\" at the time.",
      "In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\".",
      "He said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\".",
      "At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic.",
      "'Radically short of PPE'",
      "Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment.",
      "He defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward.",
      "The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.",
      "\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.",
      "\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"",
      "The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant.",
      "Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\".",
      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",
      "In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".",
      "He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".",
      "At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".",
      "\"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added."

      "The comments from Dame Nicole Jacobs come after ministers declined to fully accept all of her recommendations for reform in a review published in January.",
      "She added that a \"comprehensive strategy\", backed by more funding, was required to improve victims' experience of the justice system.",
      "The government said it had already taken a \"series of bold measures\" to strengthen police responses and protect victims.",
      "Further plans would be announced as part of a government strategy on violence against women and girls, a Home Office source added.",
      "Starmer promises to halve crime against women",
      "Violence against women and girls growing, says watchdog",
      "Dame Nicole's January review criticised \"systemic failures\" in the justice system, arguing that a lack of funding and low conviction rates had left victims' confidence in police and the courts \"at an all-time low\".",
      "It made twelve recommendations for improving the system, warning that a flagship Labour pledge to halve levels of violence against women and girls over a decade would otherwise \"fall flat\".",
      "In a response published on Wednesday, the government said it would accept two of her suggestions, to \"elevate the status\" of domestic abuse within policing, and to strengthen misconduct rules for officers accused of abusing women.",
      "But it rejected a recommendation for new legislation to make it easier for victims who use violence against their abuser, or who are forced into offending, to claim they were acting in self-defence.",
      "It said self-defence could already be used as a partial or full defence by domestic abuse victims accused of a range of crimes, including in cases where they are accused of murdering their abuser.",
      "It added that the Law Commission, which advises ministers on legal reforms, was looking into the issue as part of a wider review.",
      "The outcome of this would inform \"consideration of a general defence for all offences, but the government has no immediate plans to legislate to create a domestic abuse defence,\" it said.",
      "'Cherry-picking'",
      "Elsewhere, the government partially accepted nine of Dame Nicole's other recommendations, including for better training for police, judges and probation officers, and for investment to improve data sharing between different criminal justice agencies.",
      "In its responses, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pointed to a range of existing training schemes, guidance documents and forthcoming powers to deliver reforms in the various suggested areas for improvement.",
      "However, Dame Nicole said \"re-badging existing programmes as new\" would not improve the system, and warned against \"cherry-picking elements from my report\".",
      "She added that existing training schemes were \"not enough,\" while ministers had failed to provide a \"concrete assurance\" of better funding to improve how information on offending was gathered.",
      "\"I want to be clear that right now we have a criminal justice system that is failing victims of domestic abuse,\" she said.",
      "\"Without a comprehensive strategy on how the government will deliver on these recommendations, backed up by adequate funding, I am deeply concerned that this will only continue\".",
      "The Home Office and MoJ said they would consider \"how best to support victims\" as part of their response to the government's ongoing spending review, which will set departments' day-to-day spending between 2026 and 2029."

      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "The government hopes to curb the rise in the overall bill by holding some of the benefits of existing incapacity claimants flat in cash terms - rather than allowing them to rise in line with inflation - until 2030.",
      "It also plans to reduce the benefits of many new claimants outright relative to current levels.",
      "This echoes the policies of previous governments.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits were increased below the rate of inflation to save money.",
      "This included a portion of the payments received by people on incapacity benefit.",
      "However, despite these real terms cuts in many benefits, from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "The Government is also planning to keep a lid on the overall working-age benefit bill by making it harder for people to claim some disability benefits, notably PIP.",
      "This too echoes the policies of previous administrations.",
      "For instance, Rishi Sunak's government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015, and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria.",
      "Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.",
      "Encourage work",
      "The government is also seeking to make savings from the working age welfare bill by encouraging people to enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One of the proposals is to have more regular reassessments of people on incapacity benefit to determine if their condition has changed and they can now be expected to work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work.",
      "The government has said that those with \"the most severe, life-long health conditions\" will face no future reassessments. But it has not specified which conditions will qualify.",
      "It has also set out plans to encourage more people on health and disability benefits into work through tailored and personalised support.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",
      "Correction 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals. The article has been updated to reflect the full proportion, upheld at independent tribunal.",

    "summary": "On social media a self-proclaimed earthquake predictor says he can forecast big shakes, but experts say it's pure luck.",
    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Ms Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Ms Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Ms Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Ms Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Ms Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.",
      "But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.",
      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Ms Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Ms Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far."

    "story": [
      "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.",
      "Data leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.",
      "The BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.",
      "Ecopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.",
      "The company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.",
      "The huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.",
      "Members of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.",
      "The wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.",
      "When the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.",
      "One local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.",
      "In places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.",
      "A fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.",
      "Pointing to it, Yuly Vel\u00e1squez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: \"This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.\"",
      "Ecopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.",
      "In response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.",
      "He joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".",
      "Mr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"",
      "He left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.",
      "One database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.",
      "Ecopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.",
      "Mr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".",
      "\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.",
      "The BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.",
      "Ecopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.",
      "\"I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',\" he said.",
      "If you are outside of the UK, watch Colombia: Petroleum, Pollution and Paramilitaries on YouTube",
      "If you are outside of the UK, watch Colombia: Petroleum, Pollution and Paramilitaries on YouTube",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n blamed sabotage for many oil spills.",
      "Colombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.",
      "He also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.",
      "However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.",
      "Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".",
      "The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.",
      "It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.",
      "The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.",
      "The fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.",
      "She said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.",
      "It is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.",
      "A 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.",
      "Mr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.",
      "\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.",
      "Mr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.",
      "She said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.",
      "The fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.",
      "Asked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".",
      "\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.",
      "Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.",
      "Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.",
      "Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.",
      "But he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.",
      "Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.",
      "Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.",
      "\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.",
      "He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.",
      "Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.",
      "The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.",
      "Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.",
      "He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.",
      "\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.",
      "\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"",
      "And Ms Vel\u00e1squez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.",
      "\"If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,\" she said. \"If we speak and report, we are killed\u2026  And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.\"",

    "summary": "New research could force a fundamental rethink of the nature of space and time.",
    "story": [
      "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.",
      "Some of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.",
      "This early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.",
      "More data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.",
      "\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"",
      "The discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.",
      "But observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.",
      "Although we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.",
      "Several experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.",
      "Last year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.",
      "Instead, a year on, that blip has grown.",
      "\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth",
      "\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.",
      "'Weird' results",
      "The data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.",
      "\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.",
      "\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"",
      "So what is causing the variation?",
      "\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.",
      "\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"",
      "DESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.",
      "\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.",
      "More details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.",
      "The DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK."

      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",
      "The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.",
      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",
      "Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.",
      "Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.",
      "\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.",
      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

    "story": [
      "After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally on their way home.",
      "Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems.",
      "The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .",
      "Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.",
      "It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.",
      "The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.",
      "As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.",
      "Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.",
      "Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.",
      "\"They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,\" she told BBC News.",
      "How did Nasa's Suni and Butch fill nine months in space?",
      "Stranded astronauts heading back to Earth after nine months in space",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.",
      "The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.",
      "They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.",
      "\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,\" he said.",
      "Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.",
      "\"I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.\"",
      "The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.",
      "But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.",
      "Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.",
      "\"It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2026. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.\"",
      "Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",
      "Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.",
      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.",
      "Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space.",
      "\"I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss.\""

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 01:27:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",
      "So what's next?",
      "Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.",
      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",
      "\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.",
      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

      "When Storm Babet hit the town of Trowell in Nottingham in 2023, Claire Sneddon felt confident her home would not be affected.",
      "After all, when she bought the property in 2021, she was told by the estate agent that a previous flood the year before, which had reached but not effected the property, was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that flooding measures to protect the properties on the cul-de-sac would be put in place.",
      "However, when Storm Babet tore through the UK two years later, Ms Sneddon's home flooded after several days of rain.",
      "\"We knew there would be water on the cul-de-sac but no one expected it to flood internally again. However, water entered the property for five hours,\" she says.",
      "\"It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months.\"",
      "Their final insurance bill was around \u00a345,000.",
      "She says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk.",
      "Although she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. \"We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm.",
      "\"We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn't much detail other than flood zone maps.\"",
      "Climate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes.",
      "While it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk.",
      "Last December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future\u202fflood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England.",
      "It used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office.",
      "It also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively.",
      "The new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050.",
      "\"We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,\" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency.",
      "\"When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century.\"",
      "The Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk.",
      "Similar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI.",
      "\"We can no longer rely on historical data,\" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X.",
      "The London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios.",
      "It combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models.",
      "\"While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,\" he says.",
      "\"Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be.\"",
      "While banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments.",
      "\"They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,\" says Mr Ahmed.",
      "Many parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK.",
      "In the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida.",
      "To help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings.",
      "\"We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,\" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes.",
      "\"We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,\" he adds.",
      "Faura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports.",
      "\"Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,\" says Mr Holmes.",
      "Other services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property.",
      "\"If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],\" says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather.",
      "As for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group.",
      "\"Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,\" she advises.",
      "\"Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health. You are supposed to feel safe in your home, it shouldn't be a place of worry and anxiety.\""

      "The longstanding conflict escalated and led to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, the assassination of Hezbollah's senior leaders and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.",
      "The offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents.",
      "Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border."

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign pledge and a long-cherished goal of some conservatives.",
      "Accusing the agency of \"breath-taking failures\", the Republican president vowed to return the money it controls to individual states.",
      "\"We're going to shut it down as quickly as possible,\" Trump said, although the White House acknowledged that closing the agency outright would require an act of Congress.",
      "The move is already facing legal challenges from those seeking to block the agency's closure as well as sweeping cuts to its staff announced last week.",
      "Most US children attend public schools, which are free and run by local officials.",
      "A common misconception is that the federal education department operates US schools and sets curriculum, but that is primarily done by states and local districts.",
      "A relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools - about 13% - comes from federal funds. Most of the money comes from state and local taxes.",
      "Established in 1979, the department administers student loans and runs programmes to help low-income students.",
      "But Trump has accused it of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual, and political material.",

      "LISTEN: Rejecting public education in Arizona",
      "Surrounded by children seated at school desks in the White House on Thursday, Trump said \"the US spends more money on education by far than any other country\", yet he added that students rank near the bottom of the list.",
      "The Unesco Institute for Statistics said the US spends roughly 5.4% of its GDP on education, which is higher than many countries but not all.",
      "The department's budget last year was $238bn (\u00a3188bn), which is less than 2% of federal spending.",
      "The White House stated that his administration would move to cut parts of the department that remain within legal boundaries.",
      "The executive order is likely to face legal challenges, like many of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",
      "At the signing ceremony, Trump praised Linda McMahon, whom he appointed to lead the department, and expressed his hope she would be the last secretary of education.",
      "He said he would find \"something else\" for her to do within the administration.",
      "After Trump signed the order, Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy announced plans to bring legislation aimed at closing the department.",
      "But Republicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, and closing a federal department would require 60 votes, making such a goal a longshot.",

      "But even if the department is not formally closed, the Trump administration could decimate its funding and staff as it has done with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which subsequently stopped many of its programmes and humanitarian work.",
      "The text of the executive order does not include specifics on what actions the administration will take and which programmes might be axed.",
      "It orders McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure\" of the department and give authority of such matters to state and local governments.",
      "It also directs her to ensure \"the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely\".",
      "Soon after she was sworn in, McMahon sent the department's 4,400 employees a memo titled \"Our Department's Final Mission\", a possible reference to Trump's aim to close it.",
      "\"This is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students,\" she wrote.",
      "\"I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.\"",
      "Earlier reports suggested Trump would look to end some of the department's programmes and send others to different departments, such as the Treasury, something that still may happen but wasn't made clear in his executive order.",
      "America's largest teachers' union recently decried Trump's plans, saying he \"doesn't care about opportunity for all kids\".",

      "\"But don't use a 'war on woke' to attack the children living in poverty and the children with disabilities.\"",
      "For more than 40 years, conservatives have complained about the department and floated ideas to abolish it.",
      "Just two years after it was established by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, his Republican replacement, Ronald Reagan, led calls to undo it.",
      "It is the smallest agency in the president's cabinet and takes up less than 2% of the total federal budget.",
      "Some of those staff have already been affected by the Trump administration's sweeping workforce cuts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Nearly 2,100 people at the agency are set to be placed on leave from Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha.",
      "He shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles.",
      "A soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going.",
      "Artem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them.",
      "Another truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames.",
      "Artem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was \"not well organised\".",
      "\"It was pretty chaotic,\" he tells me. \"Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late.\"",
      "It wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia.",
      "The 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time \u2013 even if for many it was on foot.",
      "But he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements.",
      "While Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that \"absurd\".",
      "\"To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,\" he says. \"Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously.\"",
      "Artem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. \"What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?\"",
      "Artem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy.",
      "Ukraine is continuing its cross-border raids \u2013 not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too.",
      "Serhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks \u2013 finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\".",
      "We joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border.",
      "Serhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory.",
      "Travelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras.",
      "His own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target.",
      "Our original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller.",
      "He and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path \u2013 remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange.",
      "Serhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs.",
      "The Bradley commander confirms to me that they've been fighting in Russia. He describes the situations across the border as \"difficult, but we're holding on\".",
      "The Bradley is another reminder of Ukraine's reliance on US military support. That now seems less certain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy says it's already clear to him that there's \"haggling behind Ukraine's back\".",
      "I ask Serhiy if he thinks European nations can fill any void left by the US. Is a European \"coalition of the willing\" enough to guarantee Ukraine's security?",
      "\"I think if America doesn't help Ukraine, then a ceasefire will be agreed soon - but on extremely unfavourable terms for Ukraine,\" Serhiy replies.",
      "\"Europe clearly cannot resolve this conflict alone. They're not strong enough. They've been focussing on their own economies instead of thinking about security.\"",

    "summary": "Trump said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. The reality is proving far more difficult.",
    "story": [
      "When Donald Trump met President Zelensky in New York last September, the then US presidential candidate exuded confidence he could bring the war in Ukraine to an early end. \"If we win, I think we're going to get it resolved very quickly,\" he said.",
      "How quickly he meant varied over time. In a TV debate a few days earlier, Trump had promised he would \"get it settled before I even become president\". This was an escalation on his previous commitment in May 2023 to stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency.",
      "Trump has now been in office for more than two months and the penny may be beginning to drop in the White House that trying to end a conflict as bitter and complex as this may take time.",
      "In a television interview last weekend, the US president admitted that when he promised to end the war in a day, he was \"being a little bit sarcastic\".",
      "There are many reasons for the slower progress than Team Trump may have anticipated.",
      "First, the president's belief in the power of his personal, one-on-one diplomacy may have been misplaced. He has long believed any international problem can be solved if he sits down with another leader and agrees a deal. Trump first spoke to Vladimir Putin on 12 February, an hour-and-a-half conversation he described as \"highly productive\". The two leaders spoke again on 18 March.",
      "But it is clear these telephone calls failed to secure the immediate 30-day interim ceasefire Trump wanted. The only substantive concession he squeezed out of Putin was a promise to end Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, a commitment he is accused by Ukraine of breaking within hours of the call.",
      "Second, the Russian president has made it clear he does not intend to be rushed. His first public comments about the negotiations came last week in a press conference that was a whole month after his telephone call with Trump.",
      "Putin showed he was resolutely opposed to the US two-stage strategy of seeking an interim ceasefire before talking about a longer-term settlement. Instead, he said any talks must address what he sees as \"the root causes of the war\", namely his fears an expanding Nato alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state somehow present a threat to Russia's security. He also set out detailed questions and conditions that must be answered and met before any deal could be agreed.",
      "Third, the US strategy of directing its initial focus on Ukraine may have been misjudged. The White House came to the belief that President Zelensky was the obstacle to peace. Western diplomats acknowledge the Ukrainian government was slow to realise just how much the world had changed with the arrival of Trump.",
      "But the US pressure on Kyiv that led to the now infamous confrontation in the Oval Office - when Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, harangued the Ukrainian leader - consumed time, effort and political capital.",
      "It also ruptured transatlantic relations, setting Europe and the US at odds, another diplomatic problem that took time to settle. All the while Vladimir Putin sat back and enjoyed the show, biding his time.",
      "Fourth, the sheer complexity of the conflict makes any resolution hard. The Ukrainian offer was initially for an interim ceasefire in the air and at sea. The idea was that this would be relatively straightforward to monitor.",
      "But in last week's talks in Jeddah, the US insisted any immediate ceasefire should also include the more than 1200km-long front line in the east. Instantly that made the logistics of verifying any ceasefire more complicated. This, of course, was then rejected by Putin.",
      "But even his agreement to the more modest proposal - to end attacks on energy infrastructure - is not without its problems. It is the details about that proposal which will occupy much of the technical negotiations that are expected to take place in Saudi Arabia on Monday. Military and energy experts will draw up detailed lists of potential power plants \u2013 nuclear or otherwise \u2013 that might be protected.",
      "They will also try to agree which weapons systems should not be used. But agreeing the difference between energy and other civilian infrastructure may take some time. Remember: Ukraine and Russia are not talking to one another; they are engaging separately and bilaterally with the US which is promising to shuttle between both sides. This again adds to the time.",
      "Fifth, the US focus on the economic benefits of a ceasefire distracted attention from the priority of ending the fighting. Trump has spent time trying to agree a framework deal giving US firms access to Ukrainian critical minerals. Some saw this as the US investing in Ukraine's future - others as it extorting the country's natural resources.",
      "President Zelensky argued initially he could agree a deal only if the US promised to provide Ukraine with security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. The White House refused, saying the presence of US mining firms and workers would be deterrent enough. Eventually Zelensky conceded defeat and said he would agree a minerals deal without security guarantees. But despite that, the US has yet to sign the agreement, hoping again to improve the terms, possibly by including access to or even ownership of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.",
      "Ending wars can be complex and time consuming. We would not have got to this stage without Trump's pushing, but progress has not been as quick or simple as he believed. In December 2018, as he campaigned for the presidency, Volodymyr Zelensky suggested negotiations with Vladimir Putin would be quite straightforward. \"You need to talk in a very simple way,\" he told the Ukrainian journalist, Dmytro Gordon. '\"What do you want, what are your conditions?\" And I'd tell them: 'Here are our points.' We would agree somewhere in the middle.\"",

    "summary": "On social media a self-proclaimed earthquake predictor says he can forecast big shakes, but experts say it's pure luck.",
    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Ms Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Ms Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Ms Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Ms Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Ms Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "Thousands evacuate Santorini as more earthquakes strike island",
      "The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.",
      "But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.",
      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Ms Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Ms Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far."

You see I make mistakes too, my own insecurities and need to protect you took over and I didn't allow you the space to feel what you were feeling. Don't let others decide who you are. Not even me. You have far more experience at being you than anyone else. And no-one else can be a better you than you.",
      "Thankfully, I get second chances at being a better mother, and when a few weeks later you said \"I don't like myself\", I stopped my impulse to tell you what you were and listened. There was some silence and then you opened up about how you were having a hard time with some other children in school.",
      "I thought about how to ensure you know that beauty is not skin deep. The truth is sometimes you will feel ugly. I feel ugly sometimes even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful. And so now I have made it a point to tell you how beautiful you are, not when you're feeling bad about the way you look, and not when you're dressed your best, but when you are being the best versions of you.",
      "As you grow older I know that you will not always believe that you're beautiful because we live in a social world that has distorted beauty, that has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour, or a certain shape. These beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently.",
      "Remember that you are whole and that if you start to pick apart your little nose or your hairy brows or your not quite right ears, you will start to feel ugly, but that is only because you are forgetting the whole. An elephant is a beautiful animal, but pick it apart and it's got a long wrinkly nose, strange side glancing eyes, huge sticking out ears and a big fat stomach.",
      "Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life, they are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs, they are your friends for life.",
      "Dear daughter, do you know when I'll stop loving you? Never.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65p1pv8pdo",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:08:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A lawyer for the two songwriters suing Mariah Carey said they will \"make a decision shortly on whether to appeal.\"",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \"disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",

    "summary": "Gene Hackman\u200b died of heart disease and Betsy Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Details continue to emerge about the deaths of\u00a0Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog after they were\u00a0found dead in their home\u00a0in New Mexico on Feb. 26.",
      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death. Here's what we know from officials.",
      "What did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die from?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Cellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.",
      "Based on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",
      "Hackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.",
      "Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",
      "He won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"",
      "Hackman retired from the screen in 2004.",
      "He also wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels.",
      "Gene Hackman tribute at the Oscars",
      "The\u00a0Oscars\u00a0paid tribute to Hackman at the awards show on March 2.",
      "\"Our community lost a giant and I lost a dear friend,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman before an In Memoriam video recognized actors and others who had died in the past year.",
      "Freeman appeared in two films with Hackman, \"Unforgiven\" and \"Under Suspicion.\"",
      "\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said.",
      "Who was Betsy Arakawa?",
      "Arakawa, who was raised in Honolulu, was a concert pianist and co-founder of a home furnishing business, according to The Associated Press.",
      "When she was 11, she performed at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall and later in life, she played with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, the AP reported.",

      "A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \"The Wizard of Oz\" after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\" an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Terry Jon Martin   stole them.  Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "The Judy Garland Museum's efforts to buy back the slippers at auction ultimately failed, despite being bolstered by $100,000 set aside by state lawmakers.",
      "The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. Martin's attorneys described the theft as \"one last score\" for the aging reformed mobster. But Martin got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

      "Retired Navy Admiral William McRaven was the architect of the mission that tracked down Osama bin Laden. He's also a bestselling author. Now, McRaven and his daughter, Kelly, have thoughts about children and storytelling:",
      "WILLIAM: When I was a boy, my father, an Air Force fighter pilot, would tell me stories before bedtime, making up characters and weaving them into exciting tales of adventure. Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",
      "I waited every night for a new adventure, not knowing that I was also learning a lesson.",
      "When I became a father, I wanted to pass that tradition on to my own children, including my daughter, Kelly.",
      "KELLY: When my brothers and I were children, my dad loved telling us stories. Every night, I would eagerly await his arrival, excited to hear a new tale.",
      "What I didn't realize at the time was that these stories were more than just entertaining; they were carefully crafted to teach us valuable morals and lessons that he hoped we would carry into our daily lives. Much as his own father had taught him these lessons, he was now passing them along.",
      "WILLIAM: Now, as parents, we want our children to grow up to be thoughtful, kind, generous, honest, hard-working, and courageous. We hope that they will learn these lessons by watching us, provided we do the right things in life.",
      "However, the stories we tell them at a young age play a crucial role in their development. If we tell them stories of boys and girls like them, who overcome challenges by being honest, noble and courageous, they are more likely to grow up admiring and demonstrating these qualities.",
      "KELLY: I've always understood the power of storytelling, but as a new mother, I'm even more aware of how crucial it is to continue our family tradition of reading to my daughter. At a time when reading levels are declining and screen time is on the rise, it's more important than ever to share stories that teach valuable lessons in fun and engaging ways.",
      "WILLIAM: Translating my adult books into children's books was a natural evolution, and an important mission for me. My adult books all try to convey the values that I believe make us better citizens, leaders, and human beings.",
      "I try to capture those same themes in my children's books. Whether it's the wisdom of Navy SEAL training, or the power of a simple act like making your bed, the stories we tell our children and grandchildren can shape their lives for the better.",

    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month.",

      "Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",
      "Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer.",
      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 With a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and vehicle parts from Canada and Mexico set to take effect on April 2 as part of President Trump's trade wars, car shoppers are unsure about whether to buy now or risk facing higher prices later.",
      "Even after 20 years of selling cars, general manager Brandon Wishengrad still can't predict how impending tariffs will impact prices at his family's Nissan dealership in Los Angeles.",
      "Wishengrad admits he doesn't know what to say to customers about whether prices could change.",
      "\"It's tough to say,\" Wishengrad said. \"At the moment, I think we know just as much as anybody else does.\"",
      "The average cost of a new car could increase anywhere from $3,500 to $10,000 if the tariffs take effect, according to estimates from the Anderson Economic Group. That potential uptick also depends on where the parts come from.",
      "Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, says it is a spreadsheet nightmare.",
      "\"A lot of the vehicles are final-assembled in the United States, but get engines, transmissions from Mexico and Canada,\" Caldwell explained. \"\u2026If you look across the entire industry, there's nothing that's 100% American.\"",
      "Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issued a one-month reprieve to U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he also issued a pause until Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Caldwell says that she suspects that in \"many cases\" automakers probably do not yet know what the tariffs will cost them.",
      "\"Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,\" Caldwell added.",
      "She notes that while automakers \"can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time.\"",
      "In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.  \u00a0 \"It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,\" Caldwell said.",
      "When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear. \u00a0 \"So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,\" Caldwell said. \"We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\"",
      "Wishengrad agrees that the back-and-forth about the trade war has become white noise for consumers.",

Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000.

If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",

Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training.

      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",

      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",

    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office\u00a0on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",
      "\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

    "summary": "A separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force's future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.",
      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",
      "A fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.",
      "With evolving drone and space warfare likely to be the center of any fight with China, Dan Grazier, a military procurement analyst, questions whether \"another exquisite manned fighter jet really is the right platform going forward.\" Grazier, director of the national security reform program at the Stimson Center, said $20 billion is \"just seed money. The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",
      "Few details of what the new NGAD fighter would look like have been public, although Trump said early versions have been conducting test flights for the last five years. Renderings by both Lockheed Martin and Boeing have highlighted a flat, tail-less aircraft with a sharp nose.",
      "A separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration's Air Force secretary, Frank Kendall, ordered a pause on the NGAD program to review if the aircraft was still needed or if the program, which was first designed in 2018, needed to be modified to reflect the past few years of warfighting advances.",
      "That review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.",
      "NGAD will bring \"an entirely different level of low observability,\" the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling. A future unmanned version of NGAD also is planned as the Pentagon improves the AI for the aircraft, the official said.",

      "International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",

      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can't open online accounts through the \"my Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\"",

To the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell relayed on Wednesday, tariffs are a broadside on economic growth.",
      "Where does that leave investors? Scratching their heads, judging by today's trading. Stocks wobbled early, rebounded and then lost momentum in the afternoon. The S&P 500 fell 12 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,663, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended largely flat and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%.",
      "The dip followed the stock market's modest bounce yesterday after the Fed announced it was standing pat on interest rates, as Wall Street had expected. Indeed, investors may not have learned much from the central bank and Powell's remarks given that economists have already begun forecasting weaker growth and higher inflation as the U.S. moves to deploy tariffs against Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and other countries.",
      "Powell's uncertainty principle",
      "Another thing investors didn't learn from the Fed: The world is a much more uncertain place today than it was before Mr. Trump was re-elected in November. Financial markets have slumped this year as the White House laid out its plans for tariffs, with the S&P 500 falling briefly into correction territory, or 10% below its previous peak. The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",
      "That uncertainty refers to the questions regarding how the Trump administration's economic agenda on trade, immigration, fiscal policy and government regulation could affect the economy.",
      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year. Over the longer term, the question hovering over markets will be how the economy responds to the shock therapy administered by Mr. Trump, and whether the Fed has the medicine to address it.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

The central bank forecasts inflation to edge up to 2.7%, up from from its current level of 2.5%.",
      "Policymakers now expect the nation's gross domestic product \u00a0\u2014 the total output of goods and services \u2014 to expand 1.7% this year, down from their December forecast of 2.1%. In 2024, GDP grew 2.8%.",

      "Investors had signaled virtually no chance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's rate-setting panel, lowering interest rates this month. But President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which have triggered concerns about economic growth, have also amplified uncertainty for financial markets.",

      "\"For over four decades, the company has pursued its unique Social MIssion via its public, progressive stances on issues such as migrant justice, LGBTQ+ rights, Black Lives Matter, GMO labeling, and a variety of other economic and social causes affecting historically marginalized communities,\" the complaint states. \"Unilever has repeatedly halted Ben & Jerry's social mission in direct contravention of the settlement agreement.\"",
      "Stever, the ousted CEO, had been a 34-year veteran of the company, starting his career in 1988 as a tour guide, according to Ben & Jerry's website. Before assuming the role of CEO, he served as the company's chief marketing officer for 12 years. His appointment to the top post marked the first time a staff member had been promoted to CEO from within the company.",
      "Ben & Jerry's initial lawsuit, filed in November 2024, accused Unilever of blocking it from speaking out in support of Palestinian refugees, thereby engaging in \"inappropriate muzzling.\" According to the complaint, Unilever threatened \"Ben & Jerry's personnel should the company speak out regarding issues that Unilever prefers to censor.\"",
      "On March 3, Unilever took steps to remove and replace Stever as CEO. The lawsuit alleges that rather than\u00a0 performance issues, Unilever's \"motive for removing Mr. Stever is his commitment to Ben & Jerry's social mission and essential brand integrity and his willingness to collaborate in good faith with the independent board.\"",

      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners.

      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, to determine a business cycle is recessionary.",
      "\"There's no one agreed-upon definition of a recession, but the most commonly used metric is two back-to-back periods of negative economic growth,\" said CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. \"That would mean that we would see negative growth in U.S. gross domestic product or GDP, over two consecutive quarters.\"",

      "Recessions are generally marked by rising unemployment and a significant decline in economic activity across sectors as consumers cut back on spending and businesses put a freeze on hiring. Since 1929, there have been 14 recessionary periods in the U.S. Most recently, the U.S. economy entered a brief, two-month long recession from February to April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in the monthly report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes were back in the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 60 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,615, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 260 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 305 points, or 1.7%.",
      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes. Over the first three months of 2025, the country's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 1.2%, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.",
      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",
      "And despite the market turbulence, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst with eToro, notes that nine of 11 S&P sectors remain in positive territory in 2025. The two sectors that have sunk \u2014 technology and consumer discretionary \u2014 have fallen 7% and nearly 12%, respectively.",
      "\"Because investors' favorite stocks (and those with a heavy weighting in the index) have suffered so much, it's likely impacting investor sentiment disproportionately vs. an otherwise more orderly decline,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Historically, similar levels in sentiment have coincided with at least a short-term bottom in U.S. stocks, although it's not clear that we've seen a capitulatory type move that generally marks the bottom.\"",

      "\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 08:59:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China are driving up materials costs, while Mr. Trump's trade threats have also stoked market volatility, making housing developers and homebuyers reluctant to take on financial risks.",
      "Uncertainty around when U.S. levies could take effect and how long they could remain in place is making real estate developers reluctant to commit to new projects, impeding home construction. Prospective homebuyers, many of whom have been sidelined by rising mortgage rates, now also face higher costs due to tariffs.",
      "Greg Kraut, co-founder and CEO of KPG Funds, a New York-based property design and development firm, said such concerns are weighing heavily on the housing industry.",
      "\"Tariffs are causing indecision in the marketplace and eroding confidence, which is leading to developers not leasing or people not building their houses,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Material costs are already elevated, he noted, while fragile consumer confidence and confusion around what form tariffs will take is leading to indecision.",
      "Less demand for fixer-uppers",
      "New York City realtor Kirsten Jordan said buyers are gravitating toward homes that are fully built and move-in ready in order to \"to lock in their housing costs before everything gets more expensive.\"",
      "By contrast, it's a tough-time for sellers to market so-called fixer-uppers, which could cost more than usual to renovate.",
      "\"The fixer-upper buyer is often more price-conscious to begin with, so the tariff premium is a tough pill to swallow,\" she said.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, obtained wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a Canadian company that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "But by sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago, he told the Associated Press.",
      "\"I'm not about to go out of business, but it's looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\" he said.",
      "Still, Kraut notes there are limits to how much homebuilders can lift prices to offset their own rising costs. \"You can only pass through so much to the consumer, and if the Walmarts and Targets and homebuilders say we can't afford these prices, they'll say you have to lower lumber prices coming out of Canada or we aren't going to buy it.\"",
      "After Trump earlier this month provided a one-month reprieve from tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber, the NAHB warned that the levies \"will make it harder for builders and their customers to move ahead with new construction projects.\"",

      "A number of major retailers have warned recently that Americans are paring back on spending. Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. Sales in January were also revised down, according to the figures released Monday.",
      "\"Many observers were disappointed in January's retail sales figures, and February's numbers contribute to the 'economic growth is slowing' narrative,\" Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst with Bankrate, said in an email.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has taken a big hit in recent weeks, due mostly to concerns about tariffs on top of already elevated prices, and we're seeing increasing evidence that consumers are pulling back,\" he added.",
      "Last week, consumer sentiment dropped to a two-year low on concerns about economic growth, according to a gauge released by the University of Michigan. Experts say the Trump administration's move to impose steep new tariffs on key U.S. trading partners has heightened uncertainty for consumers and businesses, while also spooking investors.",
      "The latest retail sales numbers point to \"increased spending reluctance on the part of the consumers as flagging consumer sentiment, rising job insecurity and another bout of cold winter weather took a toll on households' willingness to spend,\" EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour said in a report. \"Aside from the strong increase online and at personal care stores, sales were mixed across retailers and the largest decline in sales at restaurants and bars in two years suggests consumers are cutting back on non-essential expenses.\"",

    "story": [
      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",

      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

    "summary": "The court asked the government if \"someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen,\" how do they challenge their removal?",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge raised questions about the lack of due process for immigrants deported under a wartime authority and rebuked the Justice Department for ignoring his order to turn around two deportation flights last Saturday.",
      "\"I made it very clear what you had to do,\" D.C. Chief District Judge James Boasberg told Drew Ensign, the government attorney leading the case. \"Did you not understand my statements in that hearing,\" he asked Ensign.",
      "The flights carried more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. The law gives the president broad authority to expel foreign nationals during wartime. Boasberg blocked the administration from relying on that authority Saturday and in a hearing the same day, ordered the two flights to be turned around in midair and returned to the U.S. The Trump administration did not follow the order, stating later that the flights were outside of U.S. airspace and therefore outside of the judge's jurisdiction.",
      "\"You did tell them it was an order from me to turn the planes around \u2026 to bring back people to the United States? You understood that,\" Boasberg said Friday. \"Did you understand that when I said 'do that immediately,' I meant it?\"",
      "\"I understood your intent to be what you were announcing would be binding,\" Ensign replied. The Justice Department has argued that because Boasberg's verbal order was not reflected in a written order, it was not binding.",
      "Boasberg reminded the government it can continue to deport immigrants, but it may not do so under the Alien Enemies Act. \"It's important for the public to make sure those facts are clear,\" he said. He expressed concern that the proclamation was \"essentially signed in the dark\" on Saturday and then the migrants were \"rushed onto planes.\"",
      "He asked whether the Trump administration had invoked the act quietly because it believes it to be problematic. The Justice Department declined to say more. Boasberg noted that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, \"had advance notice of this proclamation because it's impossible this could have happened within two hours,\" which Ensign confirmed.",
      "The legal question raised by the use of the Alien Enemies Act is whether the government can summarily deport people without an \"individualized assessment of their status,\" Boasberg said, raising questions about due process for the migrants. He asked the government, \"What happens if someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen? How do they challenge their removal?\"",
      "The Justice Department did not offer a direct response.",
      "Boasberg asked hypothetically whether the president could declare Chinese fishing vessels were invading the U.S. \u2014 and then proceed to detain and deport all the Chinese fishermen. Ensign affirmed that he could.",
      "Ensign argued that the deportees maintain their ability to challenge their removal from the U.S. and detention in the El Salvador prison, even though they are no longer in U.S. custody. But he also argued that the Alien Enemies Act authorizes expulsion and detention of foreign nationals by the executive branch.",
      "Boasberg asked the government, if the detainees \"are entitled to some sort of hearing, some sort of individualized process \u2026 what is the standard for review of the executive's evidence\" about whether the detainees are members of Tren de Aragua and are Venezuelan?",
      "Deference to the executive branch should not be a given, Boasberg said. The Justice Department maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction and deference should be given to the executive.",
      "Boasberg asked the government what the role of the court was in ensuring that people aren't improperly deported to Salvadoran prisons. He also raised the Alien Terrorist Removal Court as an avenue for the Justice Department to remove aliens who are suspected of terrorism. It was established by Congress in 1996, but it has never been used to deport a suspected alien terrorist.",
      "\"If you determine that an alien is an alien enemy under the AEA and may be summarily removed, aren't you precluding that due process challenge?\" Boasberg asked.",
      "Boasberg also indicated he was considering narrowing his temporary restraining order blocking the administration from carrying out any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He suggested he might modify it to allow the removal of those who admit they are members of Tren de Aragua or who do not challenge their deportation.",
      "He also asked for further briefing from both sides on remedies the government should set up for administrative proceedings such as a hearing board and legal review of the cases on an individual basis.",
      "\"We are a long way from the government being willing to provide people with this process,\" said Lee Gelernt, arguing for the plaintiffs. He welcomed the idea of administrative hearings but also asked for judicial review to prevent the Alien Enemies Act from being invoked \"against any gang.\"",

      "The Senate DFL caucus joined Republicans calling for him to step aside, calling the details of the felony allegations \"horrifying.\" They would've voted to expel him, too, they said. If they had, it would've been a historic event in the Minnesota Legislature. While there have been motions to expel members before, none of them have ever passed, according to the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, which notes that its archive doesn't include all records dating back to statehood. But researchers have never found evidence that it's happened before.",
      "\"The safety of the interns who come here to work and learn, the safety and security of the staff who put their days in here were incompatible with the predatory nature of Mr. Eichorn's behavior as reported in the criminal complaint,\" said Sen. Erin Murphy, DFL-Saint Paul.",
      "The Senate GOP has previously tried to expel Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, who is charged with felony burglary in state court\u00a0for allegedly breaking into her stepmother's home last April. She has pleaded not guilty and will stand trial in June and she has resisted calls to step aside from Republicans and some in her own party. Those efforts\u00a0didn't advance to a final vote due\u00a0to procedural setbacks.",
      "When asked by reporters why Murphy isn't pushing for Mitchell to step down, Murphy replied, \"The difference between the dispute with Senator Mitchell and this is night and day.\"",
      "According to court documents, Eichorn texted the number posted and inquired about the sex acts and the cost. Days after initial contact, police arrested him Monday during an arranged meeting between Eichorn and the purported teenager, during which officers found $130 cash and a condom in his car.",
      "The criminal complaint said Eichorn in one text exchange was alerted of the person's age and replied, \"It's [sic] says age of consent is 16.\"",

The judge read him his Miranda rights and then read him a lengthy list of the conditions of his release once a spot in a halfway house becomes available. He'll have GPS monitoring and be forbidden from contact with anyone under 18 and barred from computer access.",
      "Besides the high-profile suspect, this a unique case \u2014 a local investigation that at first brought state charges, but then the federal government got involved and took over.",
      "Legal analysts WCCO spoke with said that's more than just a symbolic choice. If convicted, Eichorn is likely to be sentenced to federal prison.",
      "\"There's a huge difference in penalties. In state court, a person would rarely ever go to prison on a child solicitation. The only times you would ever see that happen is if the person has a very bad criminal history,\" criminal defense attorney Joe Tamburino said. \"But normally there's not a prison sentence, whereas in federal court there would be a prison sentence in many situations the mandatory minimum of 10 years would apply.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:06:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Beginning March 31, those who cannot verify their identity over the agency's online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process. They also announced recently that Social Security field offices across the country will be closing.",
      "Of the 47 SSA field offices listed for closure on the website for the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, 26 are slated for closure this year, with some taking effect as early as next month, according to an Associated Press analysis of the data.",
      "That change, in addition to the impending closure of field offices across the country, and a plan to reduce the agency workforce with mass layoffs, could result in massive delays to services, advocates say. Nancy LeaMond of the AARP said eliminating phone verification \"will result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs.\"",
      "Leamond, the AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the announcement \"not only comes as a total surprise but is on an impractical fast-track.\"",
      "\"SSA needs to be transparent about its service changes and seek input from the older Americans who will be affected. Because any delay in Social Security caused by this change can mean real economic hardship,\" LeaMond said.",
      "Agency leaders said Tuesday that the agency would begin training frontline employees and management about the new policy for the next two weeks.",
      "Pushback from Democrats came quickly. A group of 62 House Democrats wrote Wednesday to the agency's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, to express concern about how the changes could hurt older beneficiaries in remote areas and people with limited internet access.",
      "\"Requiring beneficiaries to seek assistance exclusively online, through artificial intelligence, or in person at SSA field offices would create additional barriers, particularly for those who live far from an office,\" they wrote. \"We strongly urge you to consider the individuals who may be harmed.\"",
      "One Social Security recipient, 80-year-old Sandi Bachom of New York, said she was terrified by the change.",
      "\"What would happen if I didn't get that check?\" she said. \"I don't have any family. Everybody's dead. There's no one to take care of me.\"",
      "Bachom, a retired documentary filmmaker, credits Social Security with \"saving my life\" after losing a six-figure advertising job and falling on hard times.",
      "White House: \"We're looking out for seniors\"",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, told The AP that the intention of the change is \"stopping vulnerabilities to fraud.\"",
      "\"We're looking out for seniors by doing this,\" Fields said.",
      "In announcing the changes, Dudek said that the agency sees $100 million in direct deposit fraud every year. However, congressional testimony from an official with the SSA inspector general in May 2023 said that \"from January 2013 through May 2018 fraudsters redirected $33.5 million in benefits intended for 20,878 beneficiaries\" and made unauthorized direct deposit changes through the agency's website.",
      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can't open online accounts through the \"my Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\"",
      "Altman, of the advocacy group, believes the administration's ultimate goal is to privatize the Social Security system.",
      "Travel concerns for low-income seniors",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said he is concerned that \"some of our oldest Kentuckians, who are living on a fixed income, who don't have the resources to travel, have to travel hours to get basic questions answered.\"",
      "\"Why? Because they don't want them to do it, and they want to be able to kick them off. It's not right,\" the Democrat said. \"These are people who qualify and the federal government has an obligation to have enough offices, call-in or other resources to ultimately process the applications that are out there and answer the questions that people have.",
      "\"My concern is that what Elon Musk is trying to do is break government, not fix it.\"",
      "Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has embedded staffers in various agencies to look for ways to shrink the federal government. Musk has pushed debunked theories about Social Security and described the federal benefit programs as a \"Ponzi scheme\" rife with fraud.",
      "Bachom, the New Yorker who depends on her monthly Social Security check arriving at the middle of the month, said people she knows were alarmed by what they have heard about steps the administration has taken.",

    "story": [
      "Edesia Nutrition was among the fortunate few whose USAID agreement survived a whipsaw couple of months that saw the cancellation of more than 80% of the agency's foreign assistance contracts.",
      "Despite that, the Rhode Island manufacturer of a life-saving paste for severely malnourished babies last week had to lay off 10% of its workforce. Edesia's founder and CEO, Navyn Salem, said even though her company's contract is active, its invoices to USAID have been rejected twice this week.",
      "The delay in promised funds halted her production line, as well as payments to her largely American supply chain, including farmers who cultivate ingredients for the paste product's key ingredients.",
      "The layoffs were \"the hardest thing I've ever had to do,\" Salem said.",
      "\"The people here are like part of my family. I've been to their weddings. I've been to their family's funerals. I know their grandchildren. We're an interconnected family,\" Salem said.",
      "As Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, and others who work for President Trump have targeted the State Department agency USAID, a variety of global health nonprofits have faltered amid dramatic supply chain disruptions.",
      "Musk himself weighed in on March 2, posting on his social media site that Edesia's contract would be spared.",
      "At the time, a vital USAID payment system had yet to be restored. Salem said it was restarted recently, but on Tuesday and Wednesday she heard from USAID that at least two of her invoices had been rejected. One was denied because her goods had not yet shipped, while the other was denied even though it was for a batch that had shipped. She said it's not clear why that one was rejected.",
      "In the meantime, bills are piling up.",
      "\"There's still payroll and the lights to turn on and the peanut farmers to pay,\" Salem said.",
      "A spokesperson for the State Department replied to questions about the agency's payment systems. The agency did not immediately reply to questions about Edesia's invoices. The spokesperson said a review of the agency's grants and programs ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"exposed serious flaws in the legacy systems used to approve and issue payments at USAID.\"",
      "\"This has caused significant unforeseen delays and prompted the Administration to take unprecedented steps to implement more streamlined processes,\" the spokesperson said. \"USAID has 27 payment and finance systems, all of which have been found to be inefficient, broken, and built to intentionally make communication with other systems in the federal government impossible.\"",
      "Those unforeseen delays have rippled out beyond Edesia, Salem said.",
      "\"You have American farmers, American commodities brokers, American manufacturers, American shippers, and the NGOs, the American organizations\u2026..if one of those goes down, the whole system stops,\" she said.",
      "Edesia's prescription food, called Plumpy'Nut, had been feeding children in Africa, including South Sudan\u2014a country currently experiencing extreme famine\u2014when the delivery was disrupted.",
      "Plumpy'Nut is a ready-to-use therapeutic food, prescribed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children as young as six months old.",
      "Salem said her production line is capable of making food for 415 babies per hour, but her warehouse is filling up. In the meantime, as it responds to USAID's sudden upheaval, Edesia is itself working to be more efficient.",
      "\"We've just changed from a company that's been here for 16 years to being like a startup, to being more scrappy, we need to change the way we're doing everything,\" Salem said. \"I am endlessly optimistic and hopeful. I believe in the mission we have. I believe that the majority of Americans believe in feeding children, everywhere.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced the signing of an executive order that would begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education \"once and for all.\"",
      "\"We're going to eliminate it, and everybody knows it's right,\" the president said of the department at the White House Thursday. He added, \"We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long time.\"",
      "The U.S. spends \"more money per pupil, yet we rank near the bottom of the list in terms of success,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "He claimed that 70% of eighth graders \"are not proficient in either reading or math,\" and \"40% of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills.\" The president said that the administration would be returning education \"back to the states, where it belongs.\"",
      "After he signed the executive order, flanked by schoolchildren at desks on either side of him, the president held it up and invited Education Secretary Linda McMahon to stand with him on stage. Several Republican governors were on hand for the signing, too, including Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Michael Braun of Indiana, Gregg Abbott of Texas and Kim Reynolds of Iowa.",
      "In the two months since Mr. Trump took office, the Education Department's staff has already been slashed in half, and the administration is making plans to transfer some of its functions to other departments.",
      "Despite the president's rhetoric, fully eliminating the Department of Education would require an act of Congress. To advance most legislation in the Senate requires 60 votes, meaning seven Democrats would need to vote for it along with all Republicans.",

      "CBS News has obtained an internal government list of the names of the Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported to El Salvador as part of a secretive operation last week that has triggered a legal standoff in the U.S. and a debate around the world.",
      "On March 15, the U.S. government deported 238 male Venezuelan citizens on three flights to El Salvador, accusing them of being part of a transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua, which President Trump has labeled a foreign terrorist group and wartime enemy.",
      "Upon landing, the deported men were forcefully led off planes by heavily armed Salvadoran authorities. They were marched into armored vehicles, had their heads shaved and were transferred into cells inside El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison, known as CECOT.",
      "The high-profile deportations quickly set off a legal battle in the U.S. The court fight initially centered on the legality of Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expel many of the Venezuelan deportees. It has since expanded into a showdown over whether the Trump administration knowingly defied a federal judge's order to halt deportations under the wartime law and turn the flights around.",
      "U.S. officials have said 137 of the Venezuelan men were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Beyond that, the U.S. government has provided scant details about the deportations and has not publicly released the names of those sent to El Salvador. Family members and lawyers of deportees have said they only learned their loved ones or clients had been deported to the small Central American country through videos and photos posted by the Salvadoran government and news outlets.",
      "The Trump administration has said it verified that all the Venezuelan deportees have connections to Tren de Aragua, but those accusations have been denied by relatives of some of those who were deported. The U.S. government has said in a court declaration that while some of those expelled have criminal histories in the U.S., \"many\" do not.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says it's cutting $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over policies allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.",
      "White House officials wrote in an email to CBS Philadelphia that the funding cut is connected to Lia Thomas, a transgender woman and former Penn swimmer who made headlines and drew backlash when she competed for the women's swimming team.",
      "\"UPenn infamously permitted a male to compete on its women's swimming team, overturning multiple records hard-earned by women, and granting the fully intact male access to the locker room. This is NOT the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Department of Education,\" a senior White House official wrote in the email.",
      "Thomas came in first in the 500-meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships and had other top finishes in events at the Ivy League Championships that year.",
      "Some women swimmers disputed those wins. A lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court seeks to have her records removed from the record books. Separately, the Education Department launched a Title IX investigation into Penn allowing Thomas to compete on the women's swimming team.",
      "At the time, NCAA regulations allowed for trans women to compete on teams that aligned with their gender identity. President Trump undid those protections in an executive order signed in February.",
      "A senior White House official said in an email that the funding is an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The funding that was paused came from the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "A Penn spokesperson said Wednesday the Philadelphia-based university is aware of media reports and social media posts about the funding being pulled, but has received no formal notice from the White House.",
      "In a statement Thursday, a Penn spokesperson said the university \"has always followed NCAA and conference policies regarding student participation on athletic teams and is in full compliance with the recent changes to the NCAA rules that were made in response to the executive order from the Trump administration regarding transgender athletes. The University does not have a policy that is separate from its governing bodies.\"",
      "\"NCAA policies have evolved over the years,\" the statement continued. \"Beginning in 2010, the NCAA required that transgender student athletes have access to participation on college teams. In February of this year, after the Trump administration's executive order banning the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports, the NCAA revised its policy in compliance with the executive order, as did our conference. Penn is in full compliance with this most recent change.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, the White House's\u00a0@RapidResponse47 account shared a clip from Fox Business on X\u00a0on the news.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday's action is separate from an Education Department investigation into Penn over alleged violations of Title IX, a 1972 law barring sex discrimination in education.",
      "City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, whose district includes Penn's campus, denounced the decision in a statement.",
      "\"These funds have nothing to do with transgender student athletes \u2014 this is nothing more than a hollow pretext to target our community,\" Gauthier's statement said in part. \"What Trump is really doing is threatening tens of thousands of jobs, our hospitals, lifesaving research projects, educational programs for underserved youth, and so much more.\"",
      "Gauthier added that some prior actions from the Trump administration have not held up to lawsuits and that she is proud that many transgender Philadelphians call her district home.",
      "\"They make our community stronger and a better place to live. I will always stand with them,\" Gauthier said.",
      "Gauthier also said the move is not about athletics but about attacking Philadelphia.",

The government argues the records were clearly marked as confidential or secure and were copied by Buma in the hours before he left his job in the bureau in October 2023.",
      "The charging documents also allege that days after taking copies of the records, Buma used social media to post excerpts of a book he was writing about his career with the bureau.

He had also testified before a Senate committee in 2023 that his informants were the first to alert the government about possible misconduct by Hunter Biden business dealings in Ukraine with an energy company. He said they provided information \"concerning Hunter Biden's escapades in Ukraine with Burisma and how he used his position as the vice president's son to get a lucrative position.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday blocked the government from deporting a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this week as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses.",
      "Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral associate who was studying and teaching at Georgetown on a student visa. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "Attorneys for Suri filed a writ of habeas corpus and accompanying complaint challenging his detention in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Tuesday, one day after his arrest. CBS News obtained the documents on Thursday.",
      "In an order later in the day, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.\"",
      "The complaint filed by Suri's attorneys said he was surrounded and detained by masked DHS agents as he was returning to his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, where he lives with his wife Mapheze Saleh and their three children, after breaking his fast for Ramadan on March 17.",
      "\"The agents identified themselves as members of the Department of Homeland Security and stated that the government had revoked his visa,\" the complaint said, adding that \"the agents had face coverings and Ms. Saleh could only see their eyes.\"",
      "Roughly two hours after his arrest, Suri called his wife to let her know that he was being sent to a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, his attorneys said. They added that they believe he is likely to be moved to a detention facility in Los Fresnos, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. As of Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator showed Suri was being held at a detention facility in Louisiana. His lawyers have filed a motion seeking his return to Virginia.",
      "Suri's attorneys said his \"unjustified detention\" violated his due process rights. They argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech, namely his and his wife's views of Israel and Gaza, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and constitutes viewpoint discrimination. They said that he has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime.",
      "The complaint alleged that the couple had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\" known as The Canary Mission. The site alleges that Saleh, who Suri's attorneys said is a U.S. citizen, \"has worked for Hamas, expressed support for Hamas terrorism and called for Israel's destruction,\" according to a profile dedicated to her on the site. The Canary Mission, the complaint said, runs a blacklist of individuals who its creators believe support Palestinian rights and \"is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students.\" The complaint also alleges that the couple were \"smeared\" by other websites.",
      "A Georgetown University spokesperson said Suri obtained his visa in order \"to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the school spokesperson told CBS News. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"",
      "In its own statement, a spokesperson for DHS told CBS News that Suri was a \"foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\"",
      "The DHS spokesperson claimed that Suri had \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on March 15 that \"Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the spokesperson added.",
      "The detention follows ICE agents' controversial March 8 arrest in New York City\u00a0of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and green card holder who was involved in the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests.",
      "The 30-year-old Khalil, an Algerian national who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, is also being held in Louisiana detention facility. Khalil was arrested in front of his wife, who was eight-months pregnant at the time.",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, DHS alleged Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism,\" alleging the former student \"led activities aligned to Hamas,\" but without providing evidence of the claim or detailing any alleged criminal charges against him.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order in the challenge brought by unions who argued DOGE's access was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "How likely is it that some of these judges facing scrutiny from President Trump will be impeached?",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Trump this week joined the growing chorus of calls to punish federal judges who rule against his administration. But impeachment and removal are unlikely under the current makeup of Congress.",
      "The recent calls to impeach federal judges increased earlier this week when Mr. Trump posted on social media that a U.S. district judge overseeing his administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members should be impeached.",
      "While the attack by Mr. Trump marked the first time he called for a judge to be impeached, his Republican allies and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have for weeks been denouncing members of the judiciary who have been overseeing the myriad legal challenges to the president's policies and ruled against the administration.",
      "In the House, a small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers have introduced or signed onto resolutions to impeach four of those judges. While it's unlikely the efforts will gain enough traction to result in their removals, they have reignited the debate over impeachment and the high bar for removal for high crimes and misdemeanors.",
      "The GOP calls to impeach a federal judge",
      "The president called for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's impeachment in a post on social media Tuesday, saying without naming him that \"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued the attacks on Boasberg and other judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration.",
      "\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she told reporters during a press briefing. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slowwalk this administration's agenda and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "Leavitt said the president \"has made it clear that he believes this judge in this case should be impeached.\" She noted that the White House will comply with judicial orders and mount appeals of adverse rulings, as it has done so far but accused judges of undermining the will of the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump.",
      "Freshman Rep. Brandon Gill, a Texas Republican, on Tuesday filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg after Mr. Trump's post, alleging on social media that Boasberg \"is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\" Five Republicans have signed onto the impeachment articles as cosponsors.",
      "Impeachment resolutions have also been introduced against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, John Bates and Amir Ali. GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia said last month that he was going to draft impeachment articles against U.S. District Judge John McConnell, but they do not appear to have been filed.",
      "How does impeachment work?",
      "Under the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" It's highly unlikely any of the judges who are targets of impeachment resolutions have met that high hurdle.",
      "As with presidential impeachments, the power to impeach, convict and remove judges falls to Congress. While the House has impeachment power, under the Constitution, the Senate is responsible for holding a trial to determine if impeached officials are guilty and should be removed from their post.",
      "After lawmakers bring articles of impeachment in the House, the articles must be adopted by a simple majority for impeachment. The House then transmits the impeachment articles to the Senate, which has the \"sole Power\" under the Constitution to hold a trial that could lead to conviction and removal from office.",
      "But the Senate has a high bar for conviction, with a two-thirds majority required. Although Republicans have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, that falls short of the 67 senators needed to find an official guilty and remove them from office.",
      "The next steps in Congress",
      "How congressional leaders proceed to be seen.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff James Blair told Politico that \"it'll be up to the speaker\" to determine what can be passed and whether to pursue impeachment proceedings, while noting that the president is simply \"highlighting a critical issue.\"",
      "\"I think the president is right, we should impeach activist, partisan judges,\" Blair said. \"The question is, will that happen?\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson would have a number of choices if lawmakers choose to force a vote with a privileged resolution, including bringing the impeachment articles up for a risky vote, setting up a vote to table the measure, or referring it to committee.",
      "An impeachment resolution would be referred to the House Judiciary Committee for an investigation, where hearings would likely be held before advancing the impeachment articles before the full chamber. The panel's chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told CNN on Wednesday that for House Republicans and the Judiciary Committee, \"all options are still on the table.\"",
      "Impeachment proceedings would likely consume valuable time and attention that congressional Republicans are hoping to reserve for a massive budget package that would allow the president to implement much of his agenda.",
      "Asked whether an impeachment trial could impede the White House's agenda, Blair said he doubts \"a bunch of floor time will be spent on something if they strongly feel like they can't get the votes.\"",
      "How has impeachment been used against judges in the past?",
      "Just 14 federal judges and one Supreme Court justice have ever been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "Who are the judges targeted for impeachment?",
      "Republicans have introduced impeachment resolutions against four judges on the U.S. district courts after they issued preliminary decisions against the Trump administration.",
      "Paul Engelmayer: A judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Engelmayer was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011 and confirmed 98-0 by the Senate. The impeachment resolution against him claims he \"engaged in judicial misconduct\" because he temporarily blocked Trump administration officials from accessing sensitive Treasury Department databases last month.",

      "Amir Ali: Ali sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., and was appointed by former President Joe Biden. The Senate confirmed him in a 50-49 vote. Ali is overseeing a challenge to Mr. Trump's freeze on foreign assistance and issued a temporary order that required the administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts and other awards while legal proceedings moved forward.",

      "John Bates: Appointed to the district court in Washington, D.C., by former President George W. Bush in 2001, Bates' nomination was approved by the Senate in a unanimous 97-0 vote.

He was appointed to the federal district court by Obama in 2011 and confirmed 96-0, but began his career on the bench as a judge on the D.C.

      "What have the judges said?",
      "Following Mr. Trump's call for Boasberg to be impeached, Chief Justice John Roberts, the head of the federal judiciary, issued a rare statement rebuking the attack.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" the chief justice said.",
      "While Roberts' statement was rare, it is not the first time he has spoken out in response to heated comments from politicians.",
      "In March 2020, the chief justice denounced comments from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, made outside the Supreme Court as \"inappropriate\" and \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,\" Roberts said in the statement released by the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2018, he pushed back against comments Mr. Trump made during his first term about a judge who ruled against one of his asylum policies. The president called the judge an \"Obama judge.\"",
      "The U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Justice Department accused the judge in the case of continuing to \"beat a dead horse\" to pry \"legally immaterial facts\" from the government.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and top Justice Department officials said the government may invoke state secrets privilege to block a federal judge from viewing specific information about two deportation flights of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, court filings Wednesday show.",
      "In a filing excoriating D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg for demanding detailed information about the flights, the Justice Department said, \"Continuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts and wholly within a sphere of core functions of the Executive Branch is both purposeless and frustrating to the consideration of the actual legal issues at stake in this case.\" The filing was signed by Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as well as top Justice Department officials Emil Bove and Chad Mizelle.",
      "The government argued that Boasberg's demands for detailed information about the two flights from the U.S. to El Salvador on Saturday \"represent grave usurpations of the President's powers under the Alien Enemies Act and his inherent Article II powers.\"",
      "The 1798 Alien Enemies Act allows foreigners to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday and used it to send the two planes to El Salvador.",
      "On Saturday, Boasberg blocked the flights and ordered them to be turned around if they were already in the air. But the government said that the flights were already in international airspace when he issued his order and argued the judge lacked jurisdiction to order their redirection. The planes landed in El Salvador on Saturday night, the Trump administration said. In its filing Wednesday, the Justice Department claimed that disclosing some of the operational information to the court \"could implicate the affairs of United States allies and their cooperation with the United States Government in fighting terrorist organizations.\"",
      "The department argued that the disclosure \"would unquestionably create serious repercussions for the Executive Branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs.\"",
      "Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday, ordered the government to answer a number of questions by noon Thursday, including what time the two planes had departed from U.S. soil, their points of departure, what time the planes left U.S. airspace, when they landed, and what time the alleged gang members were transferred out of U.S. custody.",
      "Bondi criticized Boasberg for requesting the information in the first place, repeatedly accusing him of \"micromanagement of immaterial fact finding.\"",
      "\"The court has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the government's flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts before certifying the class action in this case,\" they said in the filing. \"That observation reflects how upside-down this case has become, as digressive micromanagement has outweighed consideration of the case's legal issues.\"",
      "They continued to argue that answering the questions posed by Boasberg would subject the government to \"a serious risk of micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions and potential public disclosure.\"",
      "In an order granting the government an additional day to comply with his order, Boasberg also criticized the Justice Department's claim that their responses to his questions would compromise sensitive information, writing that \"the Secretary of State has revealed many operational details of the flights, including the number of people involved in the flights, many of their identities, the facility to which they were brought, their manner of treatment, and the time window during which these events occurred.\"",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department has appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "On Tuesday, lawyers representing the Venezuelan migrants suing the Trump administration warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "\"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there,\" they wrote in a filing to the appellate court.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said. There are about 250 other alleged Tren de Aragua members still in the United States that the Trump administration is hoping to deport, court filings show.",

      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell swiftly moved to consider whether to void the removal of several board members just days after some of them received an email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office informing them that they had been terminated. She was also asked to block staff with DOGE\u00a0from having access to the Institute of Peace facilities.",
      "Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., convened a hearing Wednesday afternoon after five of the removed board members \u2014 Ambassador John Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph Falk, Kerry Kennedy and Mary Swig \u2014 filed a lawsuit Tuesday that challenged their firing and what they said was an \"unlawful assault\" on the Institute of Peace, which was established by Congress in 1984.",
      "In addition to the board members, the institute's president, George Moose, was also fired by ex officio board members, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice Admiral Peter Garvin. Kenneth Jackson was then installed as the acting president of the Institute of Peace.",
      "Howell said that \"none of the requirements for removal of a board member were met\" in this case, and added that even if she did reinstate them, because of the president's control over the agency, their power during the period when they were reinstated would be \"very limited.\"",
      "In denying the former board members' request for relief, Howell said it is \"undisputed\" that their removals were not in accordance with federal law, but found that they had not made the required showing for a temporary restraining order.",
      "Still, Howell had harsh words for DOGE and Trump administration officials' treatment of Institute of Peace employees, including Moose.",
      "\"I am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were\" tasked to do, she said.",
      "The dispute over the Institute of Peace burst into public view earlier this week when DOGE team members attempted to gain access to the entity's Washington, D.C., headquarters. The institute said in a statement Saturday that several DOGE members arrived at its building \"unannounced\" on Friday and were accompanied by two FBI agents.",
      "The officials were met by the institute's outside counsel, George Foote, who informed them of the organization's \"private and independent status as a non-executive branch agency,\" according to the statement. The DOGE representatives then left, the agency said.",
      "But on Monday, Moose, the institute's removed president, said in a statement that DOGE had \"broken\" into the building and were able to gain access through an employee of the Institute of Peace's former security contractor, Inter-Con Security Systems, according to court filings.",
      "Foote, the outside counsel, told the Inter-Con employees they were trespassing and called the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department to report their entry, according to the filings.",
      "The institute board members said in their lawsuit that Inter-Con and DOGE personnel \"engaged in additional attempts to unlawfully access the USIP headquarters building, but were eventually able to enter the building, forcibly occupy it, and expel including the duly appointed USIP President, other USIP personnel, and outside counsel.\"",
      "The board members had asked Howell to issue a temporary restraining order blocking Jackson, Trump administration officials and DOGE employees from accessing the Institute of Peace's facilities, computer systems or records. They also sought an order declaring their removal unlawful and void, and preventing their firing.",
      "During the hearing Wednesday, Howell on numerous occasions expressed dismay about the presence of law enforcement alongside DOGE staff.",
      "\"The defendants have not wasted any time bringing in armed law enforcement to help them,\" she said about the alleged takeover of the building.",
      "She reiterated that she was \"offended on behalf of the American citizens who have done so much \u2026 service to this country to be treated so abominably.\"",
      "During an exchange with a Justice Department lawyer, Howell questioned whether Mr. Trump could've gone to the GOP-led Congress to ask for the law establishing the Institute of Peace be changed or used his appointment power to remove and replace members of the board \"rather than taking apart the institute\" with police.",
      "What are the lawful ways to act against Institute of Peace \"without using the force of guns and threats by DOGE,\" she asked.",

      "However, the state charge was later dropped because Eichorn was federally charged on the same allegations, which the county attorney's office says is \"common practice.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on the phone Wednesday morning in a call that lasted roughly an hour, according to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Just completed a very good telephone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine,\" the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Truth Social. \"It lasted approximately one hour. Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.\"",
      "The call comes a day after Mr. Trump's lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Mr. Trump said Putin agreed to a 30-day ceasefire against Ukraine's energy and infrastructure. The commitment fell short of the full ceasefire pushed by the U.S. and agreed to by Ukraine. Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a joint statement that Mr. Trump \"fully briefed\" Zelenskyy on the call with Putin, and Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy \"agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.\" Zelenskyy, the two said, asked for additional air defense systems, and Mr. Trump \"agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.\"",
      "Waltz and Rubio also said Mr. Trump suggested the U.S. could take ownership of and run Ukrainian's nuclear power plants. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" their statement said.",
      "Zelenskyy, for his part, said he had a \"positive, very substantive, and frank conversation with president of the United States Donald Trump\" and \"thanked him for a good and productive start to the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:55:55 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed former and current USAID employees and contractors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

      "Pelosi said she's \"concerned about the next time\" there's a shutdown vote later this year, but added, \"What happened last week was last week. We're going into the future.\" She also noted that she still supports Schumer.",
      "Schumer last week decided to support a GOP continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Sept. 30, averting a shutdown just hours before the deadline.",
      "After the measure had initially passed in the House with just one Democratic vote, Schumer said he'd oppose it and criticized President Trump for not negotiating with Democrats. But he changed his mind after saying that he determined a shutdown would be a bigger threat.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:51:35 -0400",
    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination files release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents, totaling some 80,000 pages, had been released before, with sections redacted for national security purposes. The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on an initial review by CBS News. But the unveiling of key portions of the records was cheered by researchers and academics who had long argued that the details in certain reports by the CIA and FBI should have been disclosed years ago.",
      "\"This is the most positive news on the release of JFK files since the 1990s,\" said Jefferson Morley, an investigative journalist and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, which hosts a repository of JFK-related documents. He called the release an \"encouraging start\" while noting that other troves of documents still remain under wraps.",
      "The records were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of files related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "The records are unredacted versions of documents that have been released in redacted form in the past. Agencies like the CIA and FBI have argued over the years that the release of the information would harm national security, even decades after the fact.",
      "According to Morley, roughly 3,500 documents in the government's official collection of JFK files contained redactions before the latest release. There were 1,123 documents of varying lengths unveiled Tuesday, meaning about a third of the remaining redacted documents have been released in full. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 IRS records have been withheld from public release entirely.",
      "\"These new records shed new light on the events leading to JFK's assassination, including his mistrust of the CIA, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and propaganda operations involving Oswald before and after JFK was killed,\" Morley said in a statement referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. Oswald sought a visa to return to the Soviet Union in October 1963 while in Mexico City, and technical details of the CIA's surveillance operations were revealed for the first time in Tuesday's release.",
      "Another notable document released in full is a\u00a0memo prepared by Kennedy adviser Arthur Schlesinger Jr. about a potential reorganization of the CIA after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The\u00a0previously redacted\u00a0section details the number of undercover CIA personnel stationed overseas, with Schlesinger expressing concern that covert CIA activities were encroaching on the State Department.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had\u00a0discovered\u00a0roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action. Those records did not appear in Tuesday's release, according to Morley.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. The IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination, a fact that the CIA withheld from the Warren Commission. Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and the documents released Tuesday detail some technical aspects of the CIA's surveillance of Oswald and Cuban and Soviet officials.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:43:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The new findings come from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which sits on a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\"It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations \"deeply intriguing.\"",
      "\"It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.",
      "\"We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "The \"Big Crunch\"",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" he said. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",
      "Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency's Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",

      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",

    "summary": "Scientists are conducting experiments to generate clean energy through fusion, the same sub-atomic reaction that powers our Sun, with the aim of constructing plants that produce more energy than they consume.",
    "story": [
      "If it looks like the set of some Hollywood sci-fi show, perhaps that's fitting, because what they are doing here is making stars on Earth. \"We are able to make miniature stars, 'cause fusion is the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars,\" said Tammy Ma, who leads the Fusion Energy Initiative at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California. It's part of the same government laboratory that ensures the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile.",
      "\"Every time we do a fusion experiment on the NIF, we are actually the hottest place in the entire solar system, hotter than the center of the Sun,\" Ma said.",
      "The scientists here are using the largest laser ever built. It's 1,000 times more powerful than the entire U.S. electrical grid, and is housed in a massive room the size of a three football fields. Here, 192 laser beams travel nearly a mile, and then focus in on a tiny target, or fuel pellet, smaller than a peppercorn. \u00a0When the lasers hit the pellet, the atoms \"fuse\" together, releasing energy in the process.",
      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",
      "But fusion is hard. After 60 years of research by scientists at NIF, they finally generated a reaction (also called \"ignition\") that produced more energy than it consumed. The breakthrough, in 2022, crucial to ever creating a fusion power plant, made headlines around the world. Humans had unlocked the power of the stars.",

      "They have achieved ignition several times since then, and now the race is on to generate enough energy to consistently power a commercial fusion plant.",
      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different. The technology is advancing as fast as the need for clean energy is rising \u2013 stars aligning in the quest to create stars here on Earth.",
      "\"This is not a paper exercise for us,\" Mumgaard said. \"We're putting this machine together, we're buying the parts, we're machining the parts, and it's all coming together at the exact time the world really needs something like this. I think that's a really cool story.\"",

      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\"It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations \"deeply intriguing.\"",
      "\"It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.",
      "\"We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "The \"Big Crunch\"",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" he said. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",

They shared the ride home with two outgoing space station crewmates, Crew-9 commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Seventeen hours after undocking from the International Space Station, the Crew Dragon settled to a gentle, on-target splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast near Tallahassee at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "\"Splashdown! Good mains release,\" Hague radioed SpaceX flight controllers in Hawthorne, California, after the four main parachutes were released from the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Copy, splashdown,\" a SpaceX engineer replied. \"We see main chutes cut. Nick, Alex, Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home.\"",
      "\"What a ride,\" Hague said. \"I see a capsule full of grins, ear to ear.\"\ufeff",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship was stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew could be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks. The side hatch was opened at 6:38 p.m. EDT and the crew began to emerge into the fresh air and sunshine about 10 minutes later. Williams and Wilmore were the last ones out.",
      "For the two Starliner astronauts, it closed out a marathon mission that was originally supposed to last about eight days but stretched to nine-and-a-half months, covering 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles since launch last June 5 aboard a problem-plagued Boeing capsule. Their flight ranks sixth on the list of longest single NASA missions.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov spent 171 days in orbit since their launch last September aboard the Crew 9 ferry ship.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day in orbit exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "How did the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their ISS crewmates farewell, the returning astronauts floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the Harmony module's space-facing port early Tuesday, at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Starting at 5:11 p.m., the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "Twenty-seven minutes later, approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, the Crew Dragon reached the discernible atmosphere, enduring heat shield temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees as the spacecraft rapidly slowed in the thickening air.",
      "Nine minutes after entry, the Crew Dragon's three main parachutes unfurled for the capsule's final descent to splashdown in the Gulf.",
      "From the recovery ship, all four Crew-9 fliers were to be flown to shore by helicopter, where a NASA jet was waiting to ferry them back to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for reunions with family members and more extensive medical checks.",
      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

    "summary": "The gas giants outside our solar system are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

    "summary": "With a replacement crew on board the space station, NASA is eyeing Tuesday for the Starliner astronauts' return to Earth, finally ending their marathon mission.",
    "story": [
      "The Crew 10 Dragon capsule caught up with the International Space Station and moved in for a textbook docking early Sunday, bringing four fresh crew members to the lab and clearing the way for the Starliner astronauts to return to Earth after nearly 300 days in space.",
      "Approaching from behind and below, the Crew Dragon, launched Friday evening from the Kennedy Space Center, passed 1,300 feet directly under the station before looping up to a point 720 feet directly ahead of the outpost. From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"Thank you to SpaceX for the awesome ride up here,\" said co-pilot Nichole Ayers, an Air Force major and F-22 Raptor pilot. \"As a (space) rookie, that was one of the coolest things I've ever done. I can't wait to get to work up here.\"",
      "McClain, Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov -- both veteran commercial airline pilots \u2014 are replacing Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and his pilot, Sunita Williams.",
      "Three other crew members, cosmonauts Aleksey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, were launched to the station last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. They're scheduled to return to Earth next month.",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner astronaut ferry ship. The flight was originally expected to last about eight days.",
      "But during rendezvous with the space station, the Starliner experienced propulsion system problems and NASA eventually ruled out bringing the crew down on the Boeing spacecraft.",
      "Instead, the astronauts were told to remain aboard the station while the Starliner returned to Earth on its own. NASA then bumped two astronauts from the next station flight \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 freeing up two seats for use by Wilmore and Williams.",
      "When Hague and Gorbunov reached the station, Wilmore and Williams joined them to become part of Crew 9 for a normal six-month tour of duty.",
      "Now that Crew 10 has arrived, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help familiarize their replacements with space station operations before undocking and returning to Earth next week with a splashdown in the Gulf near the coast of Florida. NASA announced on Sunday it was targeting Tuesday for the return journey, with undocking scheduled for 1:05 a.m. ET and splashdown at around 6 p.m.",
      "\"NASA and SpaceX met on Sunday to assess weather and splashdown conditions off Florida's coast for the return of the agency's Crew 9 mission from the International Space Station,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "\"Mission managers are targeting an earlier Crew 9 return opportunity based on favorable conditions (predicted) for the evening of Tuesday, March 18. The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week.\"",
      "If all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams upon landing will have logged 286 days in space since launch last June. While a long flight by any standard, it's still well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days \u2014 set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with around 570 days in space overall, depending on the actual launch date. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft among U.S. astronauts: 675 days over four flights.",

      "An Olympic gold medalist and two-time heavyweight champion, Foreman competed between 1967 and 1997. He learned to box at age 16, won Olympic gold at 19.

      "In 1974, he tried to defend his title in Zaire in one of the most famous fights in history. The \"Rumble in the Jungle,\" against Muhammad Ali.",
      "Foreman described the fight to CBS Mornings in 2016 as a \"strange\" experience.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 With a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and vehicle parts from Canada and Mexico set to take effect on April 2 as part of President Trump's trade wars, car shoppers are unsure about whether to buy now or risk facing higher prices later.",
      "Even after 20 years of selling cars, general manager Brandon Wishengrad still can't predict how impending tariffs will impact prices at his family's Nissan dealership in Los Angeles.",
      "Wishengrad admits he doesn't know what to say to customers about whether prices could change.",
      "\"It's tough to say,\" Wishengrad said. \"At the moment, I think we know just as much as anybody else does.\"",
      "The average cost of a new car could increase anywhere from $3,500 to $10,000 if the tariffs take effect, according to estimates from the Anderson Economic Group. That potential uptick also depends on where the parts come from.",
      "Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, says it is a spreadsheet nightmare.",
      "\"A lot of the vehicles are final-assembled in the United States, but get engines, transmissions from Mexico and Canada,\" Caldwell explained. \"\u2026If you look across the entire industry, there's nothing that's 100% American.\"",
      "Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issued a one-month reprieve to U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he also issued a pause until Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Caldwell says that she suspects that in \"many cases\" automakers probably do not yet know what the tariffs will cost them.",
      "\"Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,\" Caldwell added.",
      "She notes that while automakers \"can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time.\"",
      "In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.  \u00a0 \"It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,\" Caldwell said.",
      "When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear. \u00a0 \"So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,\" Caldwell said. \"We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\"",
      "Wishengrad agrees that the back-and-forth about the trade war has become white noise for consumers.",
      "\"I do think so, eventually, you know, people start to tune that out.\"",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

      "The move will affect immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration program, known as CHNV, that was designed to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border by giving would-be migrants legal migration avenues.",
      "A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally.",
      "CBS News first reported in early February that the Trump administration was planning to revoke the legal status of individuals who entered the U.S. under the CHNV process.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge raised questions about the lack of due process for immigrants deported under a wartime authority and rebuked the Justice Department for ignoring his order to turn around two deportation flights last Saturday.",
      "\"I made it very clear what you had to do,\" D.C. Chief District Judge James Boasberg told Drew Ensign, the government attorney leading the case. \"Did you not understand my statements in that hearing,\" he asked Ensign.",
      "The flights carried more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. The law gives the president broad authority to expel foreign nationals during wartime. Boasberg blocked the administration from relying on that authority Saturday and in a hearing the same day, ordered the two flights to be turned around in midair and returned to the U.S. The Trump administration did not follow the order, stating later that the flights were outside of U.S. airspace and therefore outside of the judge's jurisdiction.",
      "\"You did tell them it was an order from me to turn the planes around \u2026 to bring back people to the United States? You understood that,\" Boasberg said Friday. \"Did you understand that when I said 'do that immediately,' I meant it?\"",
      "\"I understood your intent to be what you were announcing would be binding,\" Ensign replied. The Justice Department has argued that because Boasberg's verbal order was not reflected in a written order, it was not binding.",
      "Boasberg reminded the government it can continue to deport immigrants, but it may not do so under the Alien Enemies Act. \"It's important for the public to make sure those facts are clear,\" he said. He expressed concern that the proclamation was \"essentially signed in the dark\" on Saturday and then the migrants were \"rushed onto planes.\"",
      "He asked whether the Trump administration had invoked the act quietly because it believes it to be problematic. The Justice Department declined to say more. Boasberg noted that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, \"had advance notice of this proclamation because it's impossible this could have happened within two hours,\" which Ensign confirmed.",
      "The legal question raised by the use of the Alien Enemies Act is whether the government can summarily deport people without an \"individualized assessment of their status,\" Boasberg said, raising questions about due process for the migrants. He asked the government, \"What happens if someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen? How do they challenge their removal?\"",
      "The Justice Department did not offer a direct response.",
      "Boasberg asked hypothetically whether the president could declare Chinese fishing vessels were invading the U.S. \u2014 and then proceed to detain and deport all the Chinese fishermen. Ensign affirmed that he could.",
      "Ensign argued that the deportees maintain their ability to challenge their removal from the U.S. and detention in the El Salvador prison, even though they are no longer in U.S. custody. But he also argued that the Alien Enemies Act authorizes expulsion and detention of foreign nationals by the executive branch.",
      "Boasberg asked the government, if the detainees \"are entitled to some sort of hearing, some sort of individualized process \u2026 what is the standard for review of the executive's evidence\" about whether the detainees are members of Tren de Aragua and are Venezuelan?",
      "Deference to the executive branch should not be a given, Boasberg said. The Justice Department maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction and deference should be given to the executive.",
      "Boasberg asked the government what the role of the court was in ensuring that people aren't improperly deported to Salvadoran prisons. He also raised the Alien Terrorist Removal Court as an avenue for the Justice Department to remove aliens who are suspected of terrorism. It was established by Congress in 1996, but it has never been used to deport a suspected alien terrorist.",
      "\"If you determine that an alien is an alien enemy under the AEA and may be summarily removed, aren't you precluding that due process challenge?\" Boasberg asked.",
      "Boasberg also indicated he was considering narrowing his temporary restraining order blocking the administration from carrying out any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He suggested he might modify it to allow the removal of those who admit they are members of Tren de Aragua or who do not challenge their deportation.",
      "He also asked for further briefing from both sides on remedies the government should set up for administrative proceedings such as a hearing board and legal review of the cases on an individual basis.",
      "\"We are a long way from the government being willing to provide people with this process,\" said Lee Gelernt, arguing for the plaintiffs. He welcomed the idea of administrative hearings but also asked for judicial review to prevent the Alien Enemies Act from being invoked \"against any gang.\"",

      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",
      "Two online resources \u2014\u00a0ABLE Today\u00a0and the\u00a0ABLE National Resource Center\u00a0\u2014 can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies.",
      "Right now, ABLE accounts are for:",
      "People whose disability began before age 26, andPeople for whom the disability is \"terminal or long-term (more than 12 months)\" and for whom the disability causes \"marked and severe functional limitations.\"",
      "People whose disability began before age 26, and",

      "A doctor has diagnosed the disability (physical or mental).",
      "In 2026, the age limit for ABLE accounts will rise to 46.",
      "What can I do to prepare if I or a family member will qualify next year?",
      "You can begin educating yourself now about the process of setting up the account, so you can add money and fund the account right away beginning in January 2026. Family, friends, and organizations may also begin setting money aside with the intention of contributing it to the account in the individual's name as of January 1."

      "Scavino occupies the office next to the president's private dining room, the spot Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner used during the first term and Mike Donilon had during Joe Biden's presidency. Scavino, the voice of Trump's MAGA movement whose social media followers who hang on every short video and comment he posts, is now deputy chief of staff.",

She's in the outer Oval with Chamberlain Harris, a receptionist; Natalie Harp, a former One America News Network anchor who played a body-man role during the campaign; and Walt Nauta, a military aide and presidential valet who was accused of obstructing the government's efforts in an investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents in Mar-a-Lago.

      "\"He was beloved in many ways, was he not?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"I would say that's a very accurate statement,\" Carter replied.",
      "\"Patients, colleagues -- a great career,\" Van Sant noted.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" said Carter.",
      "Doctor Schwartz had a thriving practice as a kidney specialist in Tampa, Florida.",
      "His friend and medical partner, Dr. Robert Patton, admired him greatly.",
      "\"Steve was your classic gentle giant \u2026 a guy who had the heart of a bear,\" Dr. Patton said. \"He was dedicated to medicine like no physician I've ever known. He was just a wonderful guy who would do anything for anyone.\"",
      "And Dr. Schwartz had become very wealthy \u2014worth somewhere between $20 and 30 million.\u00a0 Besides his medical practice, he owned a vast array of rental properties and lived in an expensive waterfront home with his second wife, Becky.\u00a0 She managed both his medical office and investments.",
      "\"If I had to describe her, very energetic, southern charm, hospitality, 'Come in. Welcome.' You know, everything was just over the top with her,\" said April Cox.",
      "But her one-time friends, April Cox and Patrick Olive, who helped her manage the Schwartz properties, say Becky could also be a tough cookie. She fired them shortly after the murder.",
      "\"And if you cross her \u2026 then, you know, you're basically gone,\" Patrick Olive said. \"I mean, you're just outta the picture.\"",
      "Becky and Dr. Schwartz had met in the late 1990s through a dating service, and were a committed couple. She even changed her name to Schwartz -- though they didn't actually marry until 2012. \u00a0 Becky had two sons from her previous marriages, including Ben.",
      "\"Did you get along with her children?\" Van Sant asked Carter Schwartz.",
      "\"Early on, I didn't like dislike 'em, but that faded pretty quickly,\" he replied.",
      "Schwartz had Carter and two other children from his previous relationships.",
      "\"We sort of learned to coexist,\" said Carter.",

      "Carter also struggled with Becky. He says his relationship with her was \"always uneasy.\"",
      "Becky lavished luxury on herself and her own sons -- paying for their weddings. Carter says she bought them houses, cars, clothing, and jewelry for herself.\u00a0 Her son, Eric, even got a Verizon store to run in Wisconsin.",
      "\"Would you look out and see, 'All this money is going to Rebecca and her children. And me and my siblings are kind being left out here.'\" Van Sant asked Carter.",
      "\"I think you'd have to be willfully ignorant not to see it,\" he replied.",
      "Carter always believed the main reason Becky was with his father was because she wanted to spend his money.",
      "\"It became very apparent early on, her motive was financial. Even as a young child, I could see she wasn't there because she loved him,\" he said.",
      "But all that family turmoil was hidden, and to most who knew him, Dr. Schwartz seemed to have a beautiful life until the evening of May 28, 2014, when Becky Schwartz came home and discovered her home in disarray.",

      "\"It was feeling numb when people describe it.\u00a0 I think now I can relate to what they mean by that -- just a feeling of helplessness,\" Carter replied.",
      "By the time he landed back in the States, Carter called his uncle -- certain he knew who killed his father, because it struck him that to Becky, Dr. Schwartz was worth more dead than alive.",
      "\"And the first words outta my mouth on that phone call were:\u00a0 'It's Becky, Ben or a combination thereof. I don't know how, but I know one of the two of them or both are involved,'\" Carter told Van Sant.",
      "Asked if he was interviewed by police, Carter told Van Sant he was. \"I said to them, 'Please, do not overlook anyone in this family just because they're related.\"",
      "Police looked at Dr. Schwartz's inner circle.",

    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office\u00a0on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",
      "\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

      "Authorities have identified a woman whose body was found on a California cliff nearly 60 years ago.",
      "The remains were found near the end of a road in Tiburon, California by a hunter on Dec. 18, 1966. Authorities were able to determine that the body was that of a woman between the age of 45 and 60, but could not identify her or determine a cause of death, according to a news release from the forensic genetic genealogy company Othram.",
      "Investigators were able to determine that the woman had been seen at a fire station three months before her body was found. At the station, she told firefighters that she was stranded and had no money for a taxi, according to a newspaper clipping published at the time. She asked if she could sleep at the fire station, but firefighters refused and she walked away.",
      "Another newspaper article published at the time said that the remains were badly decomposed, and that authorities estimated that the body had been on the cliff for several months before it was discovered. No missing persons reports matched the remains, the article said.",
      "The woman became known as \"Marin County Jane Doe.\" The case was entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, and attempts were made to identify the woman, but no leads panned out.",
      "In 2022, the Marin County Sheriff's Office submitted forensic evidence from the case to Othram, and scientists at Othram's Woodlands, Texas lab developed a DNA profile from that evidence. The DNA profile was used in a forensic search which led to relatives of the unidentified woman.",

      "London's\u00a0Heathrow Airport \u2014 one of the busiest airports in the world \u2014 resumed some flights after being closed for most of Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. An estimated 200,000 travelers were affected by the shutdown.",
      "The first plane landed around 6:30 p.m. local time, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"We're running all flights as scheduled, including additional flights to support with reconnecting passengers and repositioning aircraft,\" a statement on Heathrow's website read early Saturday morning.",
      "British Airways, whose main hub is Heathrow, said eight long-haul flights were cleared to depart Friday evening.",
      "The airport said the fire late Thursday night at an electrical substation supplying the airport had caused a \"significant power outage,\" but on Friday afternoon, an airport spokesperson said teams had \"worked tirelessly since the incident to ensure a speedy recovery\" and that the facility was \"safely able to begin some flights later today.\" After the announcement, at least one plane could be seen taxiing.",
      "\"Please do not travel to the airport unless your airline has advised you to do so,\" the statement said. \"We will now work with the airlines on repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe. We hope to run a full operation tomorrow and will provide further information shortly.\"",
      "The spokesperson noted that, \"as the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore getting back to a full and safe operation takes time.\"",
      "Heathrow had initially said no flights would go in or out until the end of Friday, warning that it expected \"significant disruption over the coming days.\"",
      "At around 9 p.m. local time on Friday, approximately 5% of the fire near the airport was still burning, the London Fire Brigade said.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police said there was \"currently no indication of foul play,\" but that counterterrorism police would lead the investigation into the substation fire that shut down Europe's busiest airport.",
      "The London Fire Brigade said Friday that the fire was believed to be \"non-suspicious\" and that its investigation will \"now focus on the electrical distribution equipment.\"",
      "\"Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries. This is due to the specialist resources and capabilities within that command that can assist in progressing this investigation at pace to minimize disruption and identify the cause,\" the police said in a statement.",
      "Tracking services showed flights being diverted to London's Gatwick Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Ireland's Shannon Airport. British Airways\u00a0had earlier said the closure would have a significant impact on its operations and customers, adding that it was working as quickly as possible to update travelers on their options for the \"next 24 hours and beyond.\"",
      "The FlightRadar24 live tracking website showed at least 1,350 flights into and out of Heathrow were affected. According to the online service, the top route to and from Heathrow is the connection with New York's JFK International Airport, with 146 flights every week.",
      "\"I saw the time on the screen started to increase,\" passenger Tori Dunzello, who had been on a flight to the U.K. to attend her father's funeral, told CBS News partner network\u00a0BBC News. \"I turned on my world map, and I started seeing a big U-turn, and I turned around and said to my husband: 'I think we're turning around.'\"",
      "Dunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.",
      "The impact of the Heathrow power outage was likely to last several days, leaving thousands of passengers forced to find alternate travel plans.",
      "\"We're talking about several days' worth of disruption to get the planes recovered and start using them again to move planned and disrupted passengers,\" Aviation consultant John Strickland told The Associated Press, comparing the outage to \"a contained version of 9/11 or, to an extent, the Icelandic volcanic eruption\" in 2010 that shut down European airspace.",
      "\"Heathrow being such a busy airport and full, there's no kind of wriggle room for getting out of these kind of things,\" Strickland told the AP.",
      "Britain's National Rail service canceled services to and from Heathrow for the day, though some passengers could still be seen attempting to enter the airport on foot on Friday. They were turned away by police.",
      "The London Fire Brigade said 10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at a substation near the airport in the west London town of Hayes. It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was \"under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day.\"",
      "The power outage affected \"a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a\u00a0statement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated.",
      "Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a social media post that the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes, but by Friday afternoon, the National Grid power distributor said the network had \"been reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to\" the substation in Hayes.",
      "\"This is an interim solution while we carry out further work,\" National Grid said, adding: \"We are continuing to work closely with all stakeholders to manage this incident, and are focused on returning to normal resilience levels as soon as possible.\"",
      "Authorities said it wasn't clear what had sparked the blaze at the substation, but local residents reported hearing explosions.",
      "\"I was about 100 yards from the explosion,\" local resident Vaneca Sinclair told the BBC. She said she had been getting ready for bed in her home at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday evening (7:30 p.m. Eastern) when \"suddenly there was this huge bang and the house just shook.\"",
      "\"When the first explosion went off... I literally just ran out of the house,\" another local resident, Savita Kapur, told the BBC. She said she got her elderly mother in her car to drive her to her sister's house. \"When I was driving up my road the second explosion went off and the whole ground shook.\"",
      "\"We will have to look hard at the causes, and also the protection and the resilience that is in place for major, major institutions like Heathrow,\" U.K. energy secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC earlier Friday.",
      "The latest numbers from travel data provider OAG Aviation show Heathrow is the fifth busiest airport in the world this month. Earlier this year, it reported its busiest January on record, serving over 6.3 million passengers and averaging over 200,000 passengers a day. More than 1.2 million of those passengers traveled between the U.K. and the U.S.",

    "summary": "Under pressure from Trump and with Russia menacing, Germany's incoming leader plans to revamp the country's defense posture. Can he deliver?",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0In a landmark shift, Germany is set to embark on its most ambitious defense spending initiative since World War II. Lawmakers have embraced plans unveiled by\u00a0Friedrich Merz, soon to take the reins as Germany's new chancellor, for an enormous boost to the country's military budget, signaling a dramatic transformation in its post-World War II defense posture.",
      "On Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, approved a 1 trillion euro spending package that effectively lifts a decades-old \"debt brake\" measure in the nation's laws that has capped military spending at less than 1% of national GDP. The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.",
      "The package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.",
      "Merz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.",
      "At the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:",
      "First is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"",
      "The other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.",
      "Can Merz make good on his defense spending plans?",
      "There are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "Economic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.",
      "Christian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"",
      "But for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution \u2014 and even a clear commitment to one \u2014 could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.",
      "President Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.",
      "The planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.",
      "Germany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.",
      "The success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

      "The Houthis claimed Thursday that they had fired a \"hypersonic ballistic missile\" at Israel before dawn - the second claimed launch in three days. The group said it had attempted to hit Ben Gurion international airport south of Tel Aviv, and air raid alarms shattered the peace many Israelis had grown accustomed to during two months of the ceasefire at 4 a.m. across the city and central Israel.",

      "It was the most open and hard-to-call IOC presidential election in decades with Coventry expected to lead the first round short of an absolute majority. Though several rounds of votes were widely predicted, she got the exact majority of 49 needed.",
      "Coventry's win also was a victory for outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach, who has long been seen as promoting her as his successor. He did not use his right to vote.",
      "\"The young girl who first started swimming in Zimbabwe all those years ago could never have dreamt of this moment,\" Coventry said in her acceptance speech.",

      "\"I will make all of you very, very proud and hopefully extremely confident in the decision you have taken. Now we have got some work together,\" she said.",
      "Walking to the podium, she was congratulated and kissed on both cheeks by Juan Antonio Samaranch, her expected closest rival who got 28 votes.",
      "Also in the race were four presidents of sports governing bodies: Track and field's Sebastian Coe, skiing's Johan Eliasch, cycling's David Lappartient, and gymnastics' Morinari Watanabe. Also contending was Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan.",
      "Coventry will formally replace her mentor Bach on June 23 \u2014 officially Olympic Day \u2014 as the 10th IOC president in its 131-year history. Bach reached the maximum 12 years in office.",

      "Coe aimed to add to a remarkable career of Olympic triumphs: A two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, he led a bidding team for the 2012 London Olympics, then worked for the next seven years to head the organizing team of those widely praised Games. He got just eight votes.",
      "It has been a stellar week for Bach, who greeted Coventry and shared warm smiles after her acceptance speech.",
      "Bach was feted on Wednesday in an emotional start to the IOC annual meeting, getting lavish praise and the title of honorary president for life. He repeated his wish to offer advice to the next president.",
      "His hands-on executive-style presidency will deliver over a financially secure IOC, on track to earn more than $8 billion in revenue through the 2028 LA Olympics, and with a slate of future hosts through 2034: in Italy, the United States, France, Australia and finally the U.S. again, when the Winter Games return to Salt Lake City.",
      "A signature Bach policy also has been gender parity, with equal quotas of men and women athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics and giving a better balance of female members of the IOC and the executive board he chairs, which now has seven women among its 15 members, including Coventry.",
      "Her win on Thursday will only add to Bach's legacy for promoting women.",
      "Coventry won back-to-back titles in 200-meters backstroke at the 2004 Athens Olympics and Beijing four years later. She joined the IOC in 2013, almost one year after a disputed athlete election at the London Olympics. Her place among the four athletes elected was eventually awarded after Court of Arbitration for Sport rulings against two opponents.",

Instead, they were exported to Iran-linked companies Shiraz Electronics Industries, Rayan Roshd Afzar, and their affiliates, the State Department said.",

    "summary": "Here are the latest updates on what's known about Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.",
    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing in early March during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe returns to U.S. after facing questioning",
      "Riibe had been confined to a hotel in Punta Cana for more than a week as he faced questioning during the investigation, with officers escorting him anywhere he went. A judge in the Dominican Republic ruled on March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities had confiscated Riibe's passport. The judge's March 18 ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, but the next day, his attorneys said the La Altagracia Prosecutor's Office informed Riibe it was willing to return his passport.",
      "\"Although grateful for the decision of the Prosecutor's Office, Joshua decided, for privacy reasons, to request a new one at the United States Consulate, which was urgently issued to him,\" Riibe's attorneys said.",
      "He then returned home to the U.S. with his father, his attorneys said.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorneys while he still in Punta Cana.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",
      "Anna Schecter, \n                                                  \n                      The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                                  Manuel Bojorquez\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Charred bones and hundreds of articles of clothing and other personal effects were found at a location dubbed by local media as the \"ranch of horror.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mexico's attorney general on Wednesday reported irregularities in an investigation by state authorities into an alleged\u00a0cartel killing site and training camp at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco where people searching for relatives found bones and hundreds of articles of clothing and other personal effects.",
      "The \"ranch of horror,\" as some local media have dubbed it, in the town of Teuchitlan, outside Guadalajara, was found by authorities in September 2024. Six months later, a so-called search collective found charred bone fragments and personal items, raising questions about the original investigation by the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office.",
      "Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, whose office took over the investigation last week, said that investigators in Jalisco failed to register evidence and fingerprints and process vehicles found at the ranch, three of which were later stolen.",
      "He said local authorities didn't investigate the ownership of the ranch and failed to scientifically analyze locations at the ranch to understand if they were used as crematoriums. Investigators did not arrest local officials who have been linked to activities at the ranch, he said.",
      "The extensive evidence meant that the \"truth will come out\" about the grisly discovery at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco, Gertz Manero told a news conference.",
      "The United Nations Human Rights Office last week called for \"thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigations\" into the apparent crimes.",
      "Gertz Manero said federal prosecutors were also not alerted about the site, as is standard procedure, and cast blame on the state prosecutor's office despite the National Guard carrying out an operation at the site carried out last year. There is still not enough information to confirm if the ranch was used to cremate bodies or train cartel members, he added.",
      "The Jalisco Search Warriors group last week shared images that shocked many in a country that's long accustomed to stark news of cartel warfare, forced disappearances and government corruption. The images and videos showed dozens of shoes, piles of clothing and what appeared to be human bone fragments.",
      "Such collectives have long risked their lives to seek answers about what has happened to Mexico's 120,000 disappeared people in the face of rampant impunity.",
      "Vigils and protests took place over the weekend for the victims of the alleged site.",
      "On Monday, a video was circulated showing masked and heavily armed men who read a statement identifying themselves as the Jalisco New Generation cartel and questioning the motivations of the searchers.",
      "The Jalisco cartel was one of eight Latin American criminal organizations the U.S. government\u00a0designated foreign terrorist organizations\u00a0last month.",
      "Multiple mass graves have been found in recent months in Mexico. In January, at least\u00a056 bodies were discovered\u00a0in unmarked mass graves in northern Mexico, not far from the border with the United States.",
      "A\u00a0mass grave\u00a0discovered last December in a suburb of Guadalajara with dozens of bags of dismembered body parts contained the remains of 24 people, authorities said. That same month, Mexican authorities said they recovered a total of\u00a031 bodies\u00a0from pits in Chiapas, a state plagued by cartel violence.",
      "Collectives searching for missing persons\u00a0say that drug trafficking cartels and other organized crime gangs sometimes use ovens to incinerate their victims and leave no trace.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:05:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Mexico City lawmakers overwhelmingly approve legislation to keep the bullfighting tradition alive, while also keeping the bulls alive.",
    "story": [
      "Mexico City \u2014\u00a0Mexico City lawmakers on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to ban violent bullfighting, triggering outrage from aficionados and celebration from animal rights advocates. The legislation, approved by a 61-1 vote, prohibits the killing of bulls and the use of sharp objects that could injure the animals. It also sets time limits on how long bulls can be in the ring, all part of an initiative dubbed \"bullfighting without violence.\"",
      "The decision sparked angry protests from bullfighting supporters and matadors, some of whom tried to breach a police barricade at the local Congress. Some carried signs that read \"Being a fan of la fiesta brava (bullfighting) is not a crime, it's a point of pride.\"",
      "Animal rights activists and lawmakers who have been pushing the bill celebrated, however, walking out onto the steps of Congress surrounded by police in riot gear, pumping their fists and carrying stuffed bull dolls.",
      "\"It was either this or nothing,\" said Sof\u00eda Mor\u00edn, an animal rights activist with the organization Culture Without Torture, Mexico Without Bullfighting, leading the initiative to change the laws. \"We prefer this because, without a doubt, it's a huge step in protecting animals.\"",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada of the ruling Morena party echoed the activists, saying the decision would turn the Mexican capital into a place \"that respects the rights of animals.",
      "Tuesday's vote appeared to be an attempt to broker a compromise between two warring sides of the debate after years of back-and-forth about the practice.",
      "Bullfighting has long been a tradition and a pastime in Spain and many Latin American nations, but it has come under criticism for animal cruelty because bulls are often killed at the end of the fight. Animal rights groups say approximately 180,000 bulls are killed every year in bullfighting worldwide.",
      "A bloodless form of the attraction took root in California years ago, as reported by CBS San Francisco in 2021. In that version, bulls wear a Velcro pad on their backs while ornately-clad participants on horseback try to affix poles to the raging animals. Then \"forcados\" on foot enter the ring to try and literally grab the bull by the horns, but no blood is shed.",
      "The tradition, which has long drawn big crowds to arenas across Mexico, was dealt a blow when a judge in Mexico City banned the practice in June 2022, shutting down an arena that has been billed as the world's largest bullfighting ring. The judge ruled that bullfights violated city residents' rights to a healthy environment free from violence.",
      "While animal rights advocates celebrated it as a victory, and a step toward ending the bloody tradition, bullfighters said it dealt an economic blow to the city. The National Association of Breeders of Fighting Bulls in Mexico says bullfighting generates 80,000 direct jobs, and 146,000 indirect jobs across the country. Overall, the industry generates approximately $400 million a year.",
      "That was the concern for many in the crowd protesting the end of the violent fights, while others like Juan Pablo Pimienta screamed through a megaphone \"it's an activity where the fighting bull dies in a bullring. That's its nature. ... It is a beast.\"",
      "In 2023, Mexico's Supreme Court overturned the ban without explanation, allowing bullfighting arenas to be flooded once again with fans of the so-called \"fiesta brava.\"",
      "On Tuesday, in a speech before the city's congress, Green Party lawmaker Jes\u00fas Sesma acknowledged that the decision would anger a segment of the city's population.",
      "\"To those families who feel frustrated today, we're here to say that no one lost their job,\" he said. \"There was a middle ground to continue with these bullfighting spectacles, but now without violence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0For a second night in a row, Israel's military launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, killing at least 13 more people by early Wednesday after more than 400 were killed the previous day, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.",
      "Israel's military said it had targeted a Hamas military site in the enclave's southern al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, near the border with Egypt. At least two civilians were among those killed Wednesday, according to the Red Crescent.",
      "Separately, the United Nations agency UNOPS, which helps implement humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects around the world, said Wednesday that one of its staffers had apparently been killed in a blast in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.",
      "\"Reports are coming in that a UNOPS colleague has been killed in a detonation in Deir al Balah. It is understood that UNOPS accommodation was hit at approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning,\" the agency said.",
      "The statement from UNOPS came a couple hours after Israel's military issued a statement denying reports that it had struck \"a U.N. compound\" in Deir al-Balah, and adding a call for \"media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\"",
      "The mounting deaths come after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with Hamas before dawn Tuesday, resuming full-scale military operations in Gaza and threatening to ramp up its assault further. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a national address Tuesday night, vowed more strikes to force Hamas to release all of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza, about two dozen of whom are still believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel said it launched a \"limited ground operation\" in northern Gaza to retake part of a corridor that bisects it, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Even before Israel resumed military operations it had halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, drawing warnings from aid agencies and the United Nations that civilians would suffer unduly for the impasse in talks aimed at extending the ceasefire.",
      "\"It would be a blessing if this kid passed\"",
      "Dr. Marc Perlmutter, an American surgeon who has been volunteering at the al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, northern Gaza, told CBS News on Tuesday that the facility was struggling to cope with the influx of new patients wounded by Israel's attacks, and that young Palestinians were among those with the worst injuries.",
      "\"The level of bodily damage that these children get in particular is insane. My surgeries there consisted of 4- and 5- and 6-year-old kids with significant nerve injuries, and I've had to borrow nerves from both of their legs to graft nerves in their arms,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"Israel has no trouble bombing hospital grounds. Fifty feet from me is a mosque that was thoroughly destroyed. There's no inhibition on their part to focus on population centers.\"",
      "Perlmutter said given the complete lack of medical supplies \u2013 he doesn't even have soap to wash his hands \u2013 made it impossible to properly treat some of the children coming in with grave injuries.",
      "Speaking of one boy, he said \"it would be a blessing if this kid passed, because of the amount of pain and the amount of destruction in his body \u2013 and our ability to deal with it in this setting is impossibly limited \u2013 and there's no place to transfer him to. There's no level-one trauma center. They're all overwhelmed.\"",
      "Israeli protesters condemn Netanyahu's return to war",
      "Black plumes rose along Israel's border fence with Gaza on Tuesday as the tired but unrelenting mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, holding a smoke canister up to the sky, angrily protested Netanyahu's resumption of military operations.",
      "\"Don't let the prime minister and the members of his government sacrifice the lives of my son Matan and of all the other living hostages just to remain in power,\" shouted Zangauker, a prominent leader of the protests that happen every week. \"We will not give up on you, we will not allow a return to fighting.\"",
      "Hamas terrorists kidnapped her 25-year-old son from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the unprecedented massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Demonstrations, led by hostages' families, have exploded across Israel since the strikes in Gaza resumed, with thousands rallying regularly outside Israel's legislature, the Knesset, in Jerusalem and Israel's military headquarters, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv.",
      "\"I don't think they're listening. I don't think that they're listening to the people\u2026 to the people who elected them,\" hostage supporter Carmeet Roth told CBS News at a new tent encampment outside the defense complex. She said she was \"horrified\" when Israel's military relaunched airstrikes on Gaza after nearly two months of a fragile ceasefire. Her hopes for more hostages coming out alive have fallen.",
      "\"I think it is much less likely,\" she said, shaking her head. \"We've seen it before. I mean, it never brought them back. Only agreements and deals brought them back. That's the way to move forward.\"",
      "National polls consistently show a majority of Israelis \u2013 70% in a February survey -- want the ceasefire plan agreed to by Israel and Hamas, which was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, to continue as originally laid out. A second phase of that plan, which should have begun on March 1, stipulated the release of more living hostages in exchange for the full withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza.",
      "Israel, with support from the Trump administration, demanded a change to those terms as Phase-1 of the agreement ended, however, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal and calling for an extension of the first phase under a new plan it attributed to the White House.",
      "Will Gaza assault destroy Hamas, or just leave \"more hostages dead\"?",
      "Retired General Israel Ziv knows a lot about how Israeli forces operate in the Gaza Strip. He commanded the military's Gaza division during the last major clash in the early 2000s, which, while it paled in comparison to the current war, saw heavy casualties on both sides.",
      "But the 30-year veteran warned that Israel's military may have reached its limit in forcing Hamas to bend to the will of Netanyahu and his far-right government, which has vowed repeatedly to achieve its stated goal of destroying Hamas.",
      "\"You can go up to, let's say, 80%, 90% of destroying the Hamas,\" he said. \"But this last 10%, which is the hardest and the most problematic one, you cannot achieve militarily.\"",
      "Ziv said only a political solution could bring a lasting peace between Israel and Hamas, and he accused Netanyahu of operating \"without enough courage to bring some political solutions to the table.\"",
      "Ziv said Netanyahu was stuck with a Catch-22: Vowing to free the remaining hostages safely while at the same time trying to kill the people who are holding them.",
      "Israel Defense Forces International spokesman Nadav Shoshani insists the military is ready to increase pressure on Hamas, and that doing so would bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "\"We're ready with a different set of plans, including more troops on the ground and a ground operation if needed,\" he told CBS News at a briefing this week. \"History shows that the military pressure could bring back hostages.\"",
      "Ziv disagrees with that assessment.",
      "\"We know over a year now that military pressure does not bring back the hostages,\" he said. \"And in some cases, the other way - it kills them. It kills hostages.\"",

    "summary": "A thief who stole a golden toilet worth over $6 million from an English palace has been convicted, along with an accomplice in the 2019 heist.",
    "story": [
      "A thief who swiped a golden toilet from an English palace was convicted Tuesday along with an accomplice who helped cash in on the spoils of the 18-carat work of art insured for more than $6 million.",
      "Michael Jones had used the fully functioning one-of-a-kind latrine as he did reconnaissance at Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born \u2014 the day before the theft, prosecutors said. He described the experience as \"splendid.\"",
      "He returned before dawn on Sept. 14, 2019, with at least two other men armed with sledgehammers and crowbars, smashing a window and prying the toilet from its mount. Because the toilet was fully functional and connected to Blenheim Palace's plumbing system before it was taken, the removal caused \"significant damage and flooding in the building,\" police said at the time. The men escaped in stolen vehicles.",
      "\"This was an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed,\" prosecutor Shan Saunders said. \"But those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data.\"",
      "The purloined potty was stolen just days after its installation. It has never been recovered but is believed to have been cut up and sold.",
      "The golden toilet was a satirical work, titled \"America\" by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, which poked fun at excessive wealth. It weighed just over 215 pounds. The value of the gold at the time was $3.6 million.",
      "After the theft, Cattelan said he hoped the robbery was \"a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action,\" according to Blenheim Palace.",
      "The piece had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum in New York. The museum had offered the work to President Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.",
      "Jones, 39, was convicted of burglary in Oxford Crown Court.",
      "The theft was planned by James Sheen, 40, who previously pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property.",
      "Sheen then worked to broker a deal with Fred Doe to cash in on the haul, prosecutors said. In a series of text messages, Sheen referred to the loot as a \"car,\" but he was actually talking about the gold.",
      "\"I'll link up with ya, I got something right up your path,\" Sheen told Doe in one message.",
      "\"I can sell that car for you in two seconds ... so come and see me tomorrow,\" Doe said in a reply.",
      "Doe, 36, also known as Frederick Sines, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property.",

    "story": [
      "Istanbul \u2014\u00a0Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.",
      "The state-run Anadolu news agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.",
      "Authorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.",
      "Despite the ban, a live feed on the Anka News Agency's X account appeared to show protesters clashing with riot police at Istanbul University. One sign read: \"The university will not comply.\" No violence was immediately reported from the demonstrations.",
      "Private television network NTV said two Istanbul district mayors were among those detained.",
      "Critics note that the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year, and amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.",
      "\"We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\" Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video posted on social media.",
      "Germany criticized the arrests Wednesday, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer describing them as \"a serious setback for democracy.\"",
      "Internet watchdog\u00a0Netblocks\u00a0said Wednesday that its live metrics indicated Turkey was restricting access to X, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms.",
      "Erdogan, a populist with what opponents say are increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years and is now the longest-serving leader in the Turkish republic's history. His current term runs until 2028, but he has indicated he'd like to serve longer \u2014 something he could achieve with the help of a friendly parliament.",
      "Imamoglu was arrested as police searched his home, but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was confiscated. His wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television network that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken around 7:30 a.m.",
      "The Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index dropped by 7% over news of his arrest, triggering a temporary halt to trading to prevent panic selling and stabilize the market. The Turkish lira lost some 7% of its value against the dollar.",
      "Anadolu, the news agency, said that Ekrem Imamoglu and several others were suspected of extortion, money laundering and irregularities concerning tenders and procurements, among other crimes.",
      "Imamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the report said. The PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency within Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.",
      "Earlier this month, in a move lauded by the U.S., the PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire with Turkey's government, following a call from the group's long-jailed leader for it to lay down arms entirely.",
      "\"An attempted coup against our next president\"",
      "A day earlier, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying him from running in the next presidential race \u2014 a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.",
      "The mayor's party \u2014 the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP \u2014 was to hold a primary on Sunday where Imamoglu was widely expected to be chosen as its candidate in future presidential elections. The national ballot is currently scheduled for 2028, but the vote is expected to be brought forward.",
      "Despite all the arrests Wednesday, CHP party chairman Ozgur Ozel told the opposition-aligned Halik TV channel that its primary would go ahead as planned. Ozel called Imamoglu's detention \"an attempted coup against our next president.\"",
      "In a social media post written in English, Imamoglu said: \"The will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts. I stand resolute, entrusting myself not only to the 16 million residents of Istanbul but to the 86 million citizens\" of Turkey.",
      "Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.",
      "The dawn raid on Imamoglu's home and his arrest was a \"disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\" Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.",
      "As he was being arrested, Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.",
      "\"They think they can silence us and prevent us from defending and supporting Ekrem Imamoglu,\" Ongun said. \"I entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot defeat the nation.\"",
      "Police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.",
      "In nullifying Imamoglu's diploma, the university cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. Imamoglu said he would challenge the decision.",
      "Imamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.",
      "He is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.",
      "Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019 in a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The president's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.",

      "The call comes a day after Mr. Trump's lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Mr. Trump said Putin agreed to a 30-day ceasefire against Ukraine's energy and infrastructure. The commitment fell short of the full ceasefire pushed by the U.S. and agreed to by Ukraine. Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a joint statement that Mr. Trump \"fully briefed\" Zelenskyy on the call with Putin, and Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy \"agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.\" Zelenskyy, the two said, asked for additional air defense systems, and Mr. Trump \"agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.\"",
      "Waltz and Rubio also said Mr. Trump suggested the U.S. could take ownership of and run Ukrainian's nuclear power plants. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" their statement said.",
      "Zelenskyy, for his part, said he had a \"positive, very substantive, and frank conversation with president of the United States Donald Trump\" and \"thanked him for a good and productive start to the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he believes Putin wants peace, with little evidence to support that claim, three years after Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "On Wednesday, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said Putin is operating in \"good faith\" and the Russian leader issued an order following his call with Mr. Trump directing Russian forces not to attack Ukrainian energy infrastructure.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed skepticism toward the idea that Putin wants peace.",
      "\"We are skeptical when it comes to trusting the Russians,\" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. \"There is no trust to Putin. That's why I am saying we need to understand how it will work technically so that it will not depend on their desire only. That is it.\"",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said \"technical teams\" are heading to Saudi Arabia on Monday to try to hammer out terms of a ceasefire.",
      "\"I spoke today with my Russian counterpart Yuri Ushakov about President Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine,\" Waltz wrote on X. \"We agreed our technical teams would meet in Riyadh in the coming days to focus on implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire President Trump secured from Russia.\"",

Mr. Trump\u00a0had said that Putin agreed\u00a0during the call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday, however, that Russia's attacks continued to hit his country's civilian and energy infrastructure, despite Putin's purported agreement with Mr. Trump. Zelenskyy said Moscow's refusal to halt all strikes on proved the need for increased pressure on Moscow to prevent Putin from prolonging the war.",
      "\"This confirms that we must continue to pressure Russia for the sake of peace,\" he said Tuesday night. \"Only a real halt to Russia's attacks on civilian infrastructure can signal a genuine desire to end this war and bring peace closer.\"",

      "The White House described the call between Mr. Trump and Putin as the first step in a \"movement to peace\" that it hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting. But there was no indication that Putin has backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.",
      "According to the Russian government's readout of the leaders' phone call, Putin reiterated that for a full ceasefire, Moscow would require a complete cutoff of all military and intelligence support for Kyiv from the U.S. and its Western partners. Those terms were not mentioned by the White House on Tuesday.",
      "\"I do not believe that we should make any concessions in terms of assistance for Ukraine, but rather there should be an increase in assistance for Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday, reaction to the seemingly unchanged Russian demands.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump and Putin wrapped up their lengthy phone call, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.",
      "Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including a direct drone strike on a hospital in Sumy and attacks on cities in Donetsk region. Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.",
      "Emergency services said the hospital in Sumy was damaged and that about 150 patients were evacuated, but they did not report any casualties.

      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis and took roughly 250 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",

      "Andre Rives was boar-hunting when a female bear nicknamed Caramelles attacked him.",
      "On Nov. 20, 2021, two bear cubs emerged from the woods in front of Rives. Then their mother appeared, charging at him and dragging him for several yards. He shot and killed the animal.",
      "Rives sustained leg injuries and was in a state of shock. A fellow hunter managed to stem the bleeding before he was evacuated by helicopter.",
      "According to the investigation, the bear was killed 1,300 feet outside an authorized hunting area.",
      "The case caused an uproar in the department of Ariege, where hunters have held demonstrations in support of Rives.",
      "\"This is not an anti-bear or pro-bear trial,\" presiding judge Sun Yung Lazare said. Rives is on trial for \"destroying a protected species,\" she said.",
      "When the cubs emerged, \"I looked at them with admiration,\" Rives said in court. \"I made myself very small. Then the mother saw me. Our eyes met, she charged.\"",
      "He said he had no choice but to shoot.",

      "Fifteen other hunters who also took part in the hunt were being prosecuted for various offenses, including hunting in the Mont Valier nature reserve, one of the oldest reserves in the Pyrenees.",

      "Jean-Luc Fernandez, president of a local hunting federation, said Rives killed the bear in self-defense.",
      "\"He fired,\" he said. \"He should have let her do it? No, he saved his own skin.\"",

      "\"Your obligation as a hunter is to know where you are hunting,\" retorted prosecutor Olivier Mouysset.",
      "Activists contest the notion of self-defense.",
      "\"To what extent can one argue necessity, when one has committed a series of offenses that led to the death of the bear Caramelles?\" asked Alain Reynes of the bear-preservation association Pays de l'ours. According to that group, in 2023, there were 83 bears detected in the Pyrenees and 11 females gave birth.",
      "Animal rights activists view bears as integral to maintaining a fragile mountain ecosystem that is under threat from human activity and climate change.",
      "Bears had nearly disappeared from the mountain range before France began a reintroduction program in the 1990s, importing them from Slovenia.",

      "Former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter shocked fans with her latest racy dance move. (Getty)",
      "In a photo from the performance that the account Buzzing Pop posted on X, Carpenter, who donned a sparkly green and silver halter top with a matching miniskirt, was seen bending over between the two dancers who leaned into her and held hands above her.

      "The post divided fans when it went viral on social media, with some fans slamming Carpenter's performance as too inappropriate for the younger members of her fan base, while others contended that she had the right to evolve as an artist after transitioning to adulthood.",
      "Doug Eldridge of Achilles PR weighed in on the challenges that child stars face when trying to shed their former images as they grow up. He pointed out that young performers often become tightly associated with the roles that made them famous and fans can have a difficult time letting go of the characters that they loved.",
      "\"There are two 'doomsday' scenarios for every entertainer: being typecast and not getting call-backs,\" Eldridge told Fox News Digital.",
      "He continued, \"For young stars (like from Disney's Mickey Mouse Club and others), getting typecast becomes an almost paradoxical situation: you eventually age out of the role that created your stardom, yet you are too closely tied to that character/role to reliably be cast for other roles.",
      "\"It's the entertainment equivalent of purgatory \u2014 you can't stay here, and you can't go anywhere else.\"",
      "The pop star has embraced a more mature image of late. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for AEG)",
      "The PR expert explained that some former child stars and teen idols deliberately rebrand by embracing a persona that is the opposite of their established images, but warned that the move can backfire.",
      "\"Often times, you'll see a former child star try to forcibly break the Disney paradigm, either by doing racy photo shoots, or they try to force a rebrand that is a marked departure from their youth-based identity and presumed family-friendly values,\" Eldridge said.",
      "\"Unfortunately for the entertainer, this is rarely met with approval or support from the fan base that still sees them as the adorable young actor who delivered the memorable one-liners,\" he said.",
      "Eldridge told Fox News Digital that when a rebrand is unsuccessful, the fault can lie with the teams behind the stars who failed to adequately prepare for their smooth transition to a more mature identity that will be accepted by the public.",
      "\"It's the entertainment equivalent of purgatory \u2014 you can't stay here, and you can't go anywhere else.\"",
      "\"Sadly, agents and managers rarely establish a 'brand arc' for child stars to evolve into new roles, as they age up (or age out) in Hollywood,\" he said.",

      "While Carpenter's career has recently reached new heights, her provocative Paris stunt has drawn a mixed reaction from fans.",
      "The ambivalence was evident in the replies to Buzzing Pop's post about Carpenter's performance, where X users expressed both outrage and support.",
      "\"I\u2019m sorry but there are little kids in the audience and this is taking it way too far,\" one commented, while another added, \"Promoting sex positions to a primarily underage age audience? I stan her but this isn\u2019t ok\u2026\"",
      "\"'Blame the parents,' but why isn't there an age limit on her concerts? If it's not meant for kids, why are they still taking their money and letting them in? Just make it 18+ already,\" a social media user argued.",
      "However, other social media users came to Carpenter's defense, noting that the two-time Grammy nominee should be allowed to evolve from the early days of her career.",
      "Carpenter rose to fame at the age of 14 when she was cast in the Disney Channel TV series \"Girl Meets World.\" She starred in the leading role of Maya Hart in the \"Boy Meets World\" spinoff from 2014 to 2017.",
      "Many of the lyrics on Carpenter's new album feature overtly sexual lyrics. (Christopher Polk/Rolling Stone via Getty Images)",
      "The pop star has openly embraced a much more mature image since becoming an adult. In August 2024, Carpenter released her sixth studio album, \"Short n' Sweet,\" which topped the Billboard 200 chart for three consecutive weeks and has been certified platinum.",
      "Many of the songs on the album feature overly sexual lyrics and racy innuendos. Carpenter's defenders on X argued that it is the parents' responsibility to verify that her music and performances are age-appropriate for their children.",
      "\"People who take their kids to a Sabrina Carpenter concert after she\u2019s been VERY open and does this sort of position at EVERY concert that is VERY publically (sic) available to see have no right to say anything against it,\" one fan wrote.",

She traded Mickey Mouse carnage for shock, and it works.\"",
      "\"Disney stars don't sign lifetime contracts of innocence,\" he noted. \"Sabrina proves growing up isn't a crime \u2014 even if she makes parents cringe and condemn her.

It\u2019s essentially saying that female performers should not be able to embrace their sexuality in their lyrics, in the way we dress, in the way we perform.\"",
      "\"It is totally regressive,\" Carpenter continued. \"It\u2019s like those who want to shame don\u2019t make comments when I talk about self-care or body \u00adpositivity or heartbreak, which are all normal things a 25-year-old goes through. They just want to talk about the \u00adsexual side of my performances.\"",

      "There were several main limitations to the research, Bateman told Fox News Digital.",

      "These appear on brain scans as \"tiny spots of blood in the brain or localized swelling of the brain,\" the release stated.",
      "The majority of these side effects do not cause symptoms and resolve without treatment, but in rare cases ARIA can cause serious medical issues or can even be fatal.",
      "This most recent study showed that 30% of participants experienced ARIA, likely due to the higher doses of the drug.",
      "Although two participants had to stop using gantenerumab due to severe ARIA, there were no \"life-threatening adverse events and no deaths,\" the researchers noted.",
      "\"Overall, the safety profile of gantenerumab in the extension was similar to that in the original trial and in other clinical trials of gantenerumab,\" they stated.",
      "More research needed, experts agree",
      "Dr. Chris Vercammen, a board-certified internal medicine physician who specializes in geriatrics and palliative care, said that while these initial findings are \"encouraging,\" more research is needed on the effects of these medications.",
      "\"Large, randomized trials, including diverse populations and individuals with late-onset Alzheimer's, are needed to validate these early results and determine the full potential of these treatments,\" Vercammen, who is also medical director at Remo Health in California, told Fox News Digital.

      "\"You can't measure faith, but you can measure religiosity,\" he said. \"Scientists simply ask people how often they show up at church, temple or mosque, and then they compare the longevity of the people who show up to those who don't show up at all.\"",

      "In his visits to blue zones, Buettner found that the residents are usually early to bed, early to rise.",
      "\"They have kind of two sleeps, where they'll go to bed shortly after sunset, and then get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and do some chores, and then go back to sleep until sunrise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"And some good research shows that people who take a 20-minute nap five days a week have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease and about 30% lower rates of cardiovascular mortality,\" Buettner said. \"So napping is definitely part of the blue zone approach to longevity.\"",
      "\"Blue zones give us a very clear set of choices and environmental factors that would help us mindlessly get the years we deserve.\"",
      "Overall, he concluded, anyone can benefit from the lessons learned from the blue zones \u2014 primarily the importance of keeping people healthy in the first place.",

      "The Trump administration asked a D.C.-based federal judge to dissolve a previous injunction blocking the Pentagon's ban on transgender troops.",
      "In a Friday filing, the government argued that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring transgender individuals from serving in the military is not an overarching ban but instead \"turns on gender dysphoria \u2014 a medical condition \u2014 and does not discriminate against trans-identifying persons as a class.\"",
      "The government cited new guidance that the Department of Defense expects to implement, were it not for the ongoing litigation, that clarifies \"the phrase \u2018exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria\u2019\" solely applies to \"'individuals who exhibit such symptoms as would be sufficient to constitute a diagnosis.'\"",

      "Under the requirements, a party requesting to dissolve a preliminary injunction must demonstrate \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in law\" that shows that continued enforcement of the order would be \"detrimental to the public interest.\"",
      "\"The March 21, 2025, guidance constitutes a \u2018significant change,\u2019\" the filing reads. \"Whereas the Court has broadly construed the scope of the DoD Policy to encompass all trans-identifying servicemembers or applicants, the new guidance underscores Defendants\u2019 consistent position that the DoD Policy is concerned with the military readiness, deployability, and costs associated with a medical condition \u2014 one that every prior Administration has, to some degree, kept out of the military.\"",
      "JUDGE WHO BLOCKED KEY TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS LONG HISTORY OF LEFT-WING ACTIVISM, DEM DONATIONS",

      "CycloTech claims that its CycloRotor technology is the only propulsion system that can fully control the thrust vector in strength and direction throughout a complete 360-degree path. This allows the Blackbird demonstrator to have unmatched maneuverability; imagine a vehicle that can take off and land vertically, move sideways, brake mid-air and even parallel park. With six CycloRotors, the BlackBird is designed to do just that.",
      "Also, the BlackBird's design aims to decouple the flight path from the aircraft's orientation, promising a smooth and comfortable ride even in less-than-ideal conditions without needing to bank or tilt. When it comes to safety, the Blackbird has it covered with its six CycloRotors, providing redundancy in the event of an engine failure, allowing the aircraft to continue to fly in a controlled manner. CycloTech CEO Hans-Georg Kinsky notes,\u00a0\"With our BlackBird, we are showing how this innovative technology will open up the market for flying cars.\"",

The IRS has been sending out COVID-19 stimulus payments worth up to $1,400 to around 1 million tax filers who missed them. Initially, these payments were self-claimed, but now the IRS is automatically issuing them to ensure eligible taxpayers get what they\u2019re owed.",

Payments will be deposited directly using the banking information listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or sent as a paper check.",

Scammers use this information to steal your identity or financial data.",

Antivirus software can detect and block suspicious links, warn you about potentially harmful websites and prevent malware from being installed on your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always verify the authenticity of unsolicited communications:\u00a0If you receive an unexpected email, text or phone call claiming to be from a government agency, it's essential to confirm its authenticity. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to trick you into taking immediate action. To verify, always use official contact details from government websites. Avoid clicking any links in the message and reach out to the agency directly to confirm whether the communication is legitimate.",
      "3. Reach out directly if you're unsure:\u00a0When you\u2019re unsure about the legitimacy of a message or request, contact the government agency directly using verified contact details. Never respond to the message or click on any links within it. By calling or visiting the agency\u2019s official website, you can ensure you\u2019re communicating with authorized representatives and avoid scammers impersonating government officials.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts:\u00a0One of the best ways to protect your sensitive information from scammers is by using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like \"password123\" or \"qwerty.\" Instead, create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.",

      "5. Monitor your tax account: Regularly check your IRS account at\u00a0www.irs.gov to confirm the status of your tax return, verify that no unauthorized tax filings have occurred and update personal and contact information as needed.",
      "6. Report suspicious tax-related activities immediately: If you suspect a scam or fraudulent activity, it\u2019s crucial to report it to the relevant authorities right away. Whether you\u2019ve received a suspicious message or believe your information has been compromised, reporting it helps prevent further harm. The IRS and other agencies have dedicated channels for reporting fraud, so take action as soon as you can to protect yourself and others from these schemes.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: Use a personal data removal service to remove your personal information from data broker and people-finder sites, which scammers often use to find phone numbers and email addresses. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Use direct deposit for refunds: This is the safest way to receive your tax refund, reducing the risk of mail theft, forgery or fraudulent check cashing.",
      "9. Be wary of spoofed websites: Type the address of your actual tax prep site rather than clicking on a link from an email or advertisement. Investigate the domain before entering any confidential information.",
      "10. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0An identity theft protection service provides personal and financial monitoring and will try to help you if your identity is ever compromised. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

If you receive a text message from the IRS asking you to provide personal information, it\u2019s a red flag; it\u2019s not from them. Be especially cautious of any links included in the message.

      "Larsen & Toubro (L&T), a global leader in renewable energy solutions, has also played a crucial role in the Omkareshwar Floating Solar Park. L&T successfully commissioned a 90 MW floating solar power plant as part of the project. This significant contribution underscores L&T's expertise in harnessing renewable energy and its commitment to sustainable development.",

      "More than just solar panels",
      "The Omkareshwar project goes far beyond simply placing solar panels on water. The installation incorporates robust mooring systems, wave breakers and ballast anchors to ensure stability in varying conditions. Flexible cableways allow the structure to adapt to fluctuating water levels and high winds. Additionally, the project hosts the world's largest floating inverter platform, setting a global benchmark in floating solar technology.",

      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "A win-win for energy and the environment",
      "The benefits of this floating solar wonder extend far beyond clean electricity production. By shading the reservoir, the plant significantly reduces water evaporation, helping to conserve precious resources. The project conserves approximately 32.5 million cubic meters of water annually. The use of water bodies for energy production also frees up land for agriculture and other vital uses. Furthermore, TPREL's 126 MW project is set to offset a staggering 173,893 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year, making a substantial contribution to India's climate goals.",

Scammers often use your local area code or even parts of your phone number to make you think the call is legitimate. That's why it's crucial to carefully check the number before picking up.

However, removing your number from these sites can help lower the chances of spammers getting a hold of it and reaching out to you. With a data removal service, your personal information is removed from the web so data brokers and scammers never get their hands on your personal phone number, home address or email address.

      "Tech expert Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Change-of-address scams involve some of the most seemingly harmless personal information getting into the wrong hands. This can lead to a whole host of problems, including financial losses and identity theft, although change-of-address fraud is technically a form of identity theft.",
      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "Here\u2019s how it works, step by step",
      "This detailed breakdown explains the process of a change-of-address scam, from initial targeting to the potential consequences and warning signs to watch for.",
      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",
      "The other major things to keep an eye on are your credit report, credit card statements and bank statements. You can request a free credit report from one of the three credit bureaus once per year.",

      "Start by keeping detailed records: Document everything that\u2019s led you to believe your mail has been redirected. This includes the mail you were expecting, any communication with the senders of the missed mail (such as confirming dispatch dates), suspicious phone calls, texts or emails, and any unusual activity in your online accounts, bank accounts or credit reports.Reach out to the USPS for help: Use the\u00a0online locator to find and contact your local U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) office. They can assist with investigating fraudulent mail redirection.Take action if identity theft is suspected: If you believe you\u2019ve become a victim of identity fraud, visit the Federal Trade Commission's identity theft portal. This resource will help you develop a recovery plan and guide you through the steps to protect yourself.",

      "Prevention is better than a cure, and, luckily, there\u2019s a lot you can do to stop change-of-address scams before they start.",
      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: Have your personal information removed from data broker databases, including people search sites. They\u2019re the first port of call for many scammers. Without these companies in the mix, scammers aren\u2019t likely to come across your address in the first place.",
      "A reputable personal information removal service can take your data down from hundreds of sites and keep it off by resending removal requests, even as data brokers try to add your information to their databases.",

      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "3. Secure your mailbox: Consider upgrading to a\u00a0locked mailbox\u00a0to prevent mail theft. If you live in an area prone to mail theft, this simple step can stop criminals from intercepting sensitive documents before they even reach you.",
      "4. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Set up USPS Informed Delivery: Enroll in\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, a free service that lets you preview images of incoming mail before it arrives. This can help you spot missing mail early and identify potential issues with mail redirection.",
      "6. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you notice anything unusual, such as missing mail or unauthorized changes to your accounts, report it right away. Contact the USPS, your bank and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure the issue is documented and addressed promptly.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Change-of-address scams might sound like an unlikely threat, but they can wreak havoc on your finances and peace of mind if left unchecked. By staying alert, securing your personal information and taking proactive measures like monitoring your mail and credit, you can greatly reduce the risk of falling victim to these scams.

      "\"My unjust detention is indicative of the anti-Palestinian racism that both the Biden and Trump administrations have demonstrated over the past 16 months as the U.S. has continued to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians and prevented international intervention,\" Khalil wrote. \"For decades, anti-Palestinian racism has driven efforts to expand U.S. laws and practices that are used to violently repress Palestinians, Arab Americans, and other communities.

      "Foote said he never met\u00a0Biden\u00a0while serving as envoy, claiming that by then, Biden had \"deteriorated to the point that they didn\u2019t want him to see a lot of people.\" Instead, he said, Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, and U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Michele Sison devised the plan to support Henry.",
      "Foote said he recalled a remark that Biden allegedly made as a senator in 1994: \"If Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn\u2019t matter a whole lot in terms of our interests.\"\"That explains Joe Biden's approach to Haiti,\" Foote said.",

But Foote said he sees the MSS strategy as a waste of taxpayer money.",
      "\"They don't have the security backbone to take on the gangs,\" he said. \"They need help. And that help is not 5,000 random police officers from a mishmash of 10 different developing countries led by the Kenyans, who have never led a security mission in history.\"",

      "\"Having seen them on the ground in Haiti, it's an extremely professional force, extremely courageous and one committed to the mission,\" he said.",
      "Foote recommends that President Donald Trump send 60 U.S. special forces personnel to train an elite anti-gang unit in Haiti and reestablish a signals intelligence program to monitor gang communication. Without such action, he said, the consequences would extend far beyond Haiti\u2019s borders.",
      "\"It's just going to continue to create chaos right off the U.S. shores and create a massive surge in migration,\" he said. \"Because if you walk down the street in Port-au-Prince, you look around and think, 'I can understand why people leave. Humans can\u2019t live in these conditions.'\"",

      "Thirty years on from the fatal sarin nerve gas attack in Tokyo's subway network, survivors and families who lost loved ones are still seeking justice.",
      "Thirteen people were killed and thousands were sickened when cult members released sarin nerve gas in the capital's subway trains on March 20, 1995. The attack remains one of the most shocking atrocities in Japan, a country known for its low crime rates.",
      "20 YEARS LATER, A SURVIVOR RECOUNTS JAPAN'S SARIN GAS ATTACK AND HOW IT AFFECTED HIS LIFE",
      "The cult, Aum Shinrikyo or Supreme Truth, has since disbanded. Its founder, Shoko Asahara, and 12 of his disciples were executed in 2018.",
      "But 1,600 former members still operate under renamed groups and have ignored an order to pay damages to survivors and bereaved families.",
      "Shizue Takahashi lost her husband, a deputy station master, in the attack. The couple was just starting to enjoy time to themselves after raising three children when tragedy struck.",
      "\"My life is still being ruined by Aum and its successor groups,\" said Takahashi, 78. \"We need to carry on and not let the memories fade.\"",
      "People gasped for air and collapsed",
      "At 8 a.m. during the morning rush, five cult members got on separate train cars on three subway lines converging at Kasumigaseki, Japan\u2019s government center, each dropping bags of sarin on the train floors. They punctured the bags with umbrellas, releasing the gas inside the train cars.",
      "Within minutes, commuters poured out of the trains onto the platforms, rubbing their eyes and gasping for air. Some collapsed. Others fled onto the streets where ambulances and rescue workers in hazmat suits gave first-aid.",

      "The attack sickened more than 6,000. A 14th victim died in 2020 after battling severe after-effects.",
      "The subway gassing happened after a botched police investigation failed to link the cult to earlier crimes, says Yuji Nakamura, a lawyer for the survivors and the bereaved families. \"It could have been prevented,\" he said.",
      "Two days after the gassing, Tokyo police, carrying a caged canary to detect poison, raided Aum\u2019s headquarters near Mount Fuji, where the cultists lived together, trained and produced sarin. Asahara was found in a hidden compartment.",
      "Apocalyptic cult",
      "Born Chizuo Matsumoto in 1955, Asahara founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1984. The cult combined Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and yoga, and attracted young people disillusioned with materialism. He taught that death could elevate their spirits and justified killing as a virtue.",
      "Followers paid to drink Asahara\u2019s bathwater and wore electrical head gear they believed synchronized their brain waves with the guru\u2019s. He prophesized an imminent apocalypse, which only true believers would survive.",
      "Asahara gathered doctors, lawyers and scientists from Japan\u2019s top universities as his closest aides.",
      "Using donations from followers and earnings from yoga classes and health food businesses, they bought land and equipment. Asahara\u2019s scientists developed and manufactured sarin, VX and other chemical and biological weapons.",
      "In 1989, its members killed Tsutsumi Sakamoto, a lawyer who opposed the cult, his wife and baby boy. Their criminal activities escalated after their defeat in the 1990 parliamentary elections. A 1994 sarin attack in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto killed eight and injured more than 140 others.",
      "In all, Aum killed 27 people in more than a dozen attacks that culminated in the subway gassing. It was part of a plot by Asahara to hasten Armageddon, envisioning overthrowing the government.",
      "Still seeking redress",
      "Shizue Takahashi attended most of the Aum criminal trials. She has lobbied for government support, winning the enactment of a law to support crime victims and government benefits of 3 billion yen ($20 million) for more than 6,000 survivors and bereaved families of the Aum crimes.",
      "The government has also enacted laws banning sarin production and possession, and restricted the activities of groups linked to mass killings. Police have since established nuclear, biological and chemical weapons units and beefed up training.",
      "Aum\u2019s main successor, Aleph, has ignored a court order to pay 1 billion yen ($6.7 million) in compensation to survivors and bereaved families. The group has allegedly hidden billions of yen of income from yoga and spiritual seminars.",
      "Many of the subway gassing survivors still suffer health problems and trauma, according to support groups.",
      "Takahashi and others last week called on Justice Minister Keisuke Suzuki to do more to accelerate compensation by Aleph and keep them under close watch.",
      "Survivors and their supporters say lessons have not been sufficiently shared with the public.",
      "Shoko Egawa, a journalist and expert on Aum crimes, says attention on the group has largely focused on its crimes rather than teaching people to stay away from dangerous cults. \"There is still a lot to learn from (the Aum problems), including how they attracted followers, so that we can prevent people from getting their lives ruined by cults,\" Egawa said.",
      "Takahashi recently launched a website that compiles articles and comments by survivors, lawyers and writers, including Haruki Murakami\u2019s 2007 article about his 1997 book \"Underground.\"",
      "Aum\u2019s remnants",
      "At its peak, the cult boasted more than 10,000 followers in Japan and 30,000 in Russia and elsewhere.

      "After Donald Trump won the presidency again, Rebecca Carlson was counting on this being the year things turned around for her 1,300-acre farm in northern Michigan.",
      "The farm has been in her family for generations but has struggled  over the past several years amid the rising cost of fuel, fertilizer and other operating expenses. Then, last year, bad weather wiped out much of her crop.\u00a0But the return of Trump, she thought, would help reverse things.",
      "\u201cI was expecting to see a drastic turnaround for the better for my farm because the Republicans have always been for the American farmer,\u201d said Carlson, a longtime Republican and Trump supporter.",
      "Prices for cherries, her main crop, had increased during Trump's first term after his policies cut down on competition from overseas, and she was hoping to see a similar economic boost this time around. Instead, her farm has been caught up in the widespread government funding freezes, jeopardizing her ability to hire the workers she needs for this season's harvest. It could leave her $200,000 in debt if she's unable to access the grant money that had been awarded to her farm.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll admit to you, I bleed Republican. However, this has left a sour taste in my mouth,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cDuring Trump\u2019s first administration, a lot of farmers \u2014 not all, but a lot of farmers \u2014 saw the positive side to his tariffs and to his agricultural dealings.\"",
      "\"Now, we\u2019re not seeing that,\" she said. \"Now, we\u2019re seeing the actual opposite.\u201d",
      "Voters in rural and agriculture-reliant areas have been one of Trump\u2019s most consistent bases of support since he first emerged on the political scene a decade ago. But the early days of his second administration have introduced a lot of risk to this sector of the economy. Trump's proposed tariffs could drive up the price of grain and fertilizers while lowering demand overseas for U.S. agriculture products. Immigration crackdowns could cripple farm workforces, where an estimated 40% of workers lack the proper documentation to work in the U.S. Meanwhile, spending cuts and freezes have directly affected federally funded programs that provide loans and grants to farmers.",
      "Trump has acknowledged his support from farmers and talked about how his policies would benefit them by reducing imports of food from abroad, which could increase demand for some U.S.-grown products.",
      "\u201cOur new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer \u2014 I love the farmer,\u201d Trump said during his address to Congress this month.",
      "But Trump acknowledged that there will be \u201can adjustment period\u201d as his policies take shape. The president added that farmers will \u201cprobably have to bear with me again\u201d as they did during his first term, when the tariffs he put in place on China resulted in retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. agriculture products, causing U.S. exports to China to tumble.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on Friday that the department was looking into program to help \"mitigate any economic catastrophes that could happen to some of our farmers.\" Asked whether that would include direct payments, Rollins said, \"We're working that out right now.\"",
      "While the situation with tariffs moves forward, Carlson says she doesn\u2019t have much time to wait to solve her problems.\u00a0Her farm had been awarded a grant worth $400,000 through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help pay for the costs associated with hiring seasonal workers from overseas through the H-2A visa program, which farmers have used for years to hire temporary agricultural workers.",
      "The USDA describes the program on its website as a way to address labor shortages on American farms and reduce illegal immigration. It's backed by $65 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan, a Covid stimulus bill passed in 2021.",
      "But now, funding for that program appears to be frozen. Farmers like Carlson have been unable to get reimbursed for expenses they\u2019ve already incurred under the grant, and there has been no official guidance from the USDA on whether they will get reimbursed for future expenses, said Michael Marsh, head of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, a trade group that works with the many farmers using the H-2A visa program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like have the rug pulled out from underneath you,\u201d Marsh said.",
      "That\u2019s left farmers having to borrow money while they wait to be  reimbursed for expenses they've already paid for under the grant. And it means they are uncertain on whether to move forward with taking on the additional cost of hiring workers from overseas, Marsh said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting right in the middle of the busy season where we\u2019re either planting crops or pruning vines and trees, where we really need the workers here,\u201d said Marsh. \u201cBut now, you\u2019re out the money that you\u2019ve been planning on being there for you.\u201d",
      "The Department of Agriculture didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the status of the funding.",
      "Farmers aren\u2019t alone in feeling the effects of sweeping cuts and funding freezes across the government, many of which are at the center of court fights. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued executive orders pausing some funds from former President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act along with funding for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Trump has also been cutting grants to research institutions and dismantling whole agencies, like USAID, and many of the contracts and grants that come from those agencies.",
      "Carlson was planning to use her USDA grant money to hire 10 temporary workers from Guatemala to help with this year\u2019s harvest. The grant would help pay to house the required workers on her property and the visa fees and airfare to fly the workers to and from the U.S.",
      "The added workers on her farm would have been a game changer, she said. Since taking over the family farm in 2019, most of the labor has been done by her, her husband, two year-round employees and a few local seasonal workers. With the added help, she could run multiple shifts a day picking cherries to get as much of her crop harvested as possible before it starts to spoil. It also would give her more time with her four children, including her 3-year-old twins.",
      "The program to bring over the foreign workers hasn\u2019t been cheap or easy, but she saw it as the only way to boost her workforce.",
      "\u201cThe American worker doesn\u2019t like labor, they don\u2019t like to do laborious jobs,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do the hard labor, and that\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating, because we would love to hire U.S. workers, but we can\u2019t get them to show up. We can\u2019t get them to follow through. We can\u2019t get them to finish the season.\u201d",
      "Carlson has been trying to get an answer from the USDA about the status of her grant, but her grant manager told her that they were \u201cawaiting guidance from leadership.\u201d When she followed up more recently, she received an out-of-office email.",
      "\u201cWe have had no direction from our grant project managers,\" she said. \"We\u2019ve asked them, are we supposed to continue meeting our milestones and continue meeting our goals? Or do we stop and wait? All we get back with a response is an automated message.\u201d",
      "To prepare for the workers arrival, including renovating housing on her property to bring it up to code, Carlson has already spent $200,000 of her own money that she was expecting to get reimbursed under her grant\u2019s contract. Without that money in her bank account, she doesn\u2019t expect to have the funds to pay her existing staff to get through the growing season.",
      "Carlson also doesn\u2019t have much time left to make a decision about whether to spend even more to bring workers over. By April 5, she is supposed to have purchased the airfare for the workers she was planning to hire, who were supposed to arrive in May.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at that point where if we don\u2019t get this funding, there could be issues of bankruptcy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American farmer is failing right now because you\u2019re freezing funding meant to help the American farmer.\u201d"

And with the Musk-Trump approach, they\u2019re effectively terrorizing the federal civil service.\u201d",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said he, too, had concerns about the impact of cuts on recruitment efforts. A rare Republican voice on Capitol Hill who has questioned DOGE\u2019s hard-charging approach, Bacon told NBC News: \u201cDOGE has been good for showing where our money is being spent and some of the stupid projects that were funded. But it has been too rash in the firings. Better analysis needed to be done. It\u2019s not efficient to fire someone and then rehire.\u201d",

The student, who requested anonymity because she wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News she\u2019s now putting her dreams of working in government on hold and making a pivot to the private sector.",
      "\u201cI loved the work that I did so much and I could feel like it had a tangible impact on real people that I decided that I really wanted to work in the federal government,\u201d said the student, who asked that her name not be used and her agency not be identified.",
      "But she acknowledged: \u201cThe federal option isn\u2019t there. I mean, I\u2019m still holding out a little bit of hope for the federal hiring freeze to end in April, but I know that is probably not realistic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really trying to not follow the consulting, private-sector track of most Georgetown students, and I really thought the best way to do that was to go into the public sector,\u201d the student continued. \u201cBut now I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m probably just going to try to pivot into consulting, even though it\u2019s kind of late, or do tech.\u201d",
      "'Traumatically affected'",
      "Both Kaine and Van Hollen pointed to a 2023 speech by Russ Vought, now the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), where he said of federal bureaucrats that the goal of a second Trump administration would be to \u201cput them in trauma.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\u201d Vought said in a video of the speech obtained by ProPublica. \u201cWhen they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.\u201d",
      "\u201cRuss Vought was quite open about it,\u201d said Van Hollen, who added: \u201cUnfortunately, this will have a huge dampening effect on the ability to recruit.\u201d",
      "Asked about lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the government\u2019s ability to attract talented applicants in the future, White House spokesperson Liz Huston focused on the Cabinet members and other political appointees whom Trump has installed over the past two months.",
      "\u201cNever before in history has an administration hired such a huge number of qualified, capable, and America-first Patriots in such little time,\u201d Huston said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve broken records by selecting over 2,000 appointees in less than 2 months including incredible MAGA warriors like Russ Vought, Tom Homan, Sean Parnell, Harmeet Dhillon, Kash Patel, Kari Lake, Brent Bozell, and Jay Bhattacharya.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also touted the Trump administration\u2019s \u201csuccessful\u201d efforts to fill political jobs. She said 281 Trump appointees had been confirmed by the Senate so far, with another 280 in the process. And Leavitt said the administration had filled \u201c100%\u201d of the political slots at the White House, the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration.",
      "Still, those political appointees are a just a small slice of the 3 million-plus federal workforce. The overwhelming number of workers are career civil servants who traditionally remain in their jobs regardless of which party controls the White House.",
      "In addition to slashing agencies, Trump is also shutting down critical pipelines to federal careers. Started nearly a half century ago, the Presidential Management Fellows Program pairs current or recent graduate students with opportunities in the federal government, from the U.S. Agency for International Development to the National Forest Service.",
      "But on Feb. 19, Trump signed an executive order to \u201cpromptly terminate\u201d the competitive leadership development program, and its \u201ctalent management system\u201d is set to be \u201cdecommissioned\u201d at the end of this week, according to a message on the Office of Personnel Management website.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a federal governmentwide program that really draws very talented people into the federal government,\u201d Van Hollen said of the fellows program. \u201cSo I guess they don\u2019t want young people serving the country. I mean, that\u2019s the message they\u2019re sending.\u201d",
      "'They're telling them to pound sand'",
      "Arati Prabhakar, who served as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Biden administration, said the DOGE cuts are telling young people and those with highly skilled, technical backgrounds to \u201cpound sand.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible message,\u201d she said in a phone interview.",
      "During the Obama administration, Prabhakar led the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the research and development arm of the Defense Department. And she said a big part of her job was recruiting people from universities or from the private sector, where they were offered \u201cmuch higher salaries.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we got them, and they came in and they did great things. And the reason that they came is that the work was so exciting. \u2026 They have the ability at places like DARPA to address problems at scale. It was a place you could do big things, and you could do it for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes so much nurturing to find those few people, and then they make such a difference, and that\u2019s what\u2019s being disrupted. So, we\u2019ve got to get back on track.\u201d",
      "Prabhakar, now living in Silicon Valley, said she recently reconnected with a Stanford University student who had been her former intern in the White House.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s about to finish up in computer science, and what she wants to do is to bring this incredible AI expertise that she has into public service, and she even has an offer, but she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to stick in this current environment,\u201d Prabhakar explained.",
      "\u201cAnd you know what DOGE\u2019s actions are doing? Those actions are telling these immensely talented people who want to serve our country \u2014 they\u2019re telling them to pound sand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of what we should be doing ... to draw them in.\u201d"

      "Several federal judges expressed frustration this week with how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is pushing forward his sweeping agenda, as Trump and his allies got even more aggressive in their criticism of the judiciary.",
      "Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who temporarily halted deportations being carried out under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act, while also blasting the jurist on his Truth Social platform as a \u201cgrandstander\u201d whose rulings are \u201cinept.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration currently has over 15 appeals pending, including from rulings this week reining in the power of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Governmental Efficiency.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the major legal developments of the past seven days:",
      "Judge and DOJ spar over deportations",
      "Lawyers for the Justice Department chided U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for pressing them for answers after they appeared to ignore his directive over the weekend that any flights carrying out deportations under the AEA should return to the U.S., accusing him of \u201c[c]ontinuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts.\u201d",
      "At a hearing Friday, Boasberg told DOJ lawyers their filings had\u00a0\u201cthe kind of intemperate and disrespectful language I\u2019m not used to hearing from the United States.\u201d",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement Tuesday pushing back on Trump and his allies for calling for Boasberg\u2019s removal, saying that \u201cimpeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\u00a0The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\u201d",
      "Boasberg on Saturday issued a temporary order barring the administration from deporting people by invoking the AEA and ordered any such flights that were in the air to return to the U.S.",
      "There were two flights that did not return \u2014 the government claimed they were already out of U.S. airspace, so the deportees were already technically \u201cremoved\u201d from the country.",
      "At a hearing on Monday, the judge called the government\u2019s arguments a \u201cstretch\u201d and summarized them as\u00a0\u201cwe don\u2019t care, we\u2019ll do what we want.\u201d He ordered the Justice Department to turn over more information about the flights the next day, leading to the days of pushback by the administration, which claimed he was not entitled to ask questions relating to the AEA, a wartime statute that dates back to 1798.",
      "The act had previously only been invoked during major wars \u2014 the War of 1812 and both world wars.",
      "A Trump proclamation last week applied it to members of Tren De Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration has declared to be a foreign terrorist organization. The proclamation said the gang \u201cis perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\u201d",
      "That led to the suit brought on behalf of five Venezuelan nationals the government is trying to deport under the act, and who maintain they\u2019re not members of the gang.",
      "Boasberg has not yet made any finding on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the AEA cannot apply to a gang from a country the U.S. is not at war with, but Trump has continued accusing him of trying to \u201cusurp\u201d his power. \u201cNo District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result,\u201d he wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday morning.",
      "Judge says DOGE is 'hitting a fly with a sledgehammer'",
      "A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday signed a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive records for millions of Americans housed at the Social Security Administration.",
      "The \u201cmillions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent\u201d contain \u201csensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\u201d U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page opinion.",
      "That information \u201cincludes Social Security numbers, personal medical and mental health records, driver\u2019s license information, bank account data, tax information, earnings history, birth and marriage records, home and work addresses, school records, immigration and/or naturalization records, health care providers\u2019 contact information, family court records, and employment and employer records,\u201d she noted, adding the office hadn\u2019t put forward a rationale for needing such access.",
      "\u201cThe DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,\u201d Hollander wrote, describing the administration\u2019s methods as \u201ctantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.\u201d",
      "Her order barred DOGE from accessing any more sensitive records and directed it to \u201cdisgorge and delete\u201d any such data it has, as well as barring it from \u201cinstalling any software\u201d on SSA information systems.",
      "Judge calls out Elon Musk's social media posts",
      "On Tuesday, a federal judge in Maryland found Musk and DOGE\u2019s work to largely dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development \u201clikely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang\u00a0said \u201cthe power to act to eliminate federal agencies resides exclusively with Congress\u201d and that DOGE\u2019s work to dismantle USAID violates the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution.",
      "The government argued that Musk is merely an adviser to the president and was not responsible for efforts to slash the workforce and shutter USAID headquarters.",
      "The judge, however, pointed to numerous posts of Musk\u2019s on his X platform where he boasted he was responsible, including a Feb. 3 tweet where he wrote, \u201cWe spent the weekend feeding USAID to the wood chipper. Could have gone to some great parties. Did that instead.\u201d",
      "Chuang issued a preliminary injunction ordering the agency to take steps to reopen the agency\u2019s headquarters and to restore access to email, payment, security notification and other electronic systems for all USAID employees and contractors.",
      "Chuang also barred DOGE from sharing the personal information of USAID staffers outside of the agency, citing the Musk team\u2019s \u201cextremely troubling lack of respect for security clearance requirements and agency rules relating to access to sensitive data.\u201d",
      "DOGE filed an appeal of Chuang\u2019s order early Friday.",
      "Judge says she is 'very offended' by DOGE's actions but declines a restraining order",
      "Not every plaintiff that sued DOGE this week was successful in court.",
      "The U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonprofit funded by Congress and dedicated to conflict resolution, went to D.C. federal court seeking an emergency restraining order alleging that DOGE had used a \u201ctakeover by force\u201d of its headquarters and was attempting to shut it down.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell questioned DOGE\u2019s methods at a Wednesday hearing. \u201cI am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were statutorily tasked to do,\u201d Howell said, but she declined to sign the restraining order, saying the plaintiffs had not met the necessary requirements.",
      "The Justice Department had contended the administration \u201cacted in accordance with all laws\u201d and had properly removed the institute\u2019s top officials.",
      "Though Howell ruled in the government\u2019s favor, the Justice Department moved Friday to remove her from another case involving the president.",
      "Howell signed off on a restraining order barring portions of  Trump\u2019s executive order punishing Perkins Coie, a law firm that\u2019s done high-profile work for Democrats. The order suspended employees\u2019 security clearances and barred them from federal buildings.",
      "\u201cIt sends chills down my spine when you say that if the president in his view has the position that an individual, or an entity, or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation\u2019s interest, he can issue an executive order like this,\u201d Howell said at a hearing last week, calling it \u201ca pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise.\u201d",
      "The DOJ filing said the judge \u201chas repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President\u201d over the years, and cited her having signed off on parts of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigations into Trump as one of the reasons she should recuse herself.",
      "'Soaked in animus': Judge halts transgender military ban",
      "Another federal judge in D.C. issued a preliminary injunction barring the Defense Department from implementing Trump\u2019s executive order\u00a0banning transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes found the ban is \u201csoaked in animus\u201d and violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates based on transgender status and sex.",
      "\u201cIts language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,\u201d she wrote, adding that the government failed to produce evidence about how many transgender service members there are, or how transgender status impacts their military readiness.",
      "\u201cTransgender persons have served openly since 2021, but Defendants have not analyzed their service. That is unfortunate. Plaintiffs\u2019 service records alone are Exhibit A for the proposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence,\u201d Reyes wrote.",
      "At a hearing Friday, the government argued, as it had previously, that the order is focused on people with the medical condition \u201cgender dysphoria.\u201d",
      "Reyes pointed to a Feb. 27 tweet by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declaring that \u201cTransgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to abide by government officials saying one thing to the public \u2014 saying what they really mean to the public \u2014 and coming in here to the court and telling me something different, like I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Reyes told the DOJ attorney assigned to this case. \u201cI am not an idiot.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department\u00a0later called Reyes\u2019 injunction \u201cthe latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people who overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump.\u201d",
      "Judges block EPA efforts to cancel climate grants",
      "Yet another D.C. federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s decision to terminate up to $20 billion in grants for\u00a0climate\u00a0initiatives, in a case brought by the environmental group\u00a0Climate\u00a0United Fund.",
      "The money for the \u201cGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund\u201d had been appropriated by Congress in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump\u2019s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, vowed to recover those funds after he was sworn in in January, saying \u201cthe entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal,\u201d according to a court filing.",
      "The agency froze the account and later terminated the grants to the three nonprofits, which alleged the EPA didn\u2019t follow proper procedures for terminating such grants.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed.",
      "\u201cWhen the court asked EPA to proffer evidence justifying its decision given the terms of the agreement, its only response was to refer to the termination letter, which gave no legal justification for the termination,\u201d Chutkan wrote.",
      "She said that while the EPA voiced concerns regarding \u201cprogram integrity\u201d and \u201cprogrammatic fraud, waste, and abuse,\u201d \u201cvague and unsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.\u201d"

      "This week Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.",
      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0roots in the Soviet era when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sport, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.\u00a0As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada. \u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him.\u201d",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201dThroughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cping pong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming in his book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games, and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism as to whether the games will actually ever play out.",

    "story": [
      "Saturn\u2019s iconic rings will seem to \u201cdisappear\u201d for a couple of days starting this weekend \u2014 at least from our vantage point on Earth.",
      "The rings won\u2019t actually vanish, but for a short time, the angle between Earth and Saturn will create something of a cosmic illusion, making the planet\u2019s rings appear invisible from our point of view.",
      "The reason this occurs has to do with the specific tilts of both planets. Saturn\u2019s axis is tilted 26.73 degrees from vertical as it orbits the sun, which is similar to Earth\u2019s 23.5-degree tilt, according to NASA. So as each planet rotates on its axis and orbits the sun, Saturn\u2019s appearance, including its rings, can differ when viewed through telescopes or high-powered observatories on Earth.",
      "Occasionally, Saturn\u2019s angle of tilt toward Earth turns the rings precisely edge-on, making it seem like the thin bands are gone.",
      "\u201cThey literally almost disappear,\u201d said Sean Walker, an associate editor at Sky & Telescope, a monthly magazine about science and amateur astronomy. \u201cNormally you see the rings around Saturn, but when you have an edge-on view, it looks like a hair-thin line of light just cutting across.\u201d",
      "In recent months, Saturn\u2019s vast rings have appeared to progressively thin when viewed through ground-based telescopes. By Sunday, the rings will reach that precise edge-on angle.",
      "The illusion is temporary, lasting only about a day or two before the rings slowly start coming into view again.",
      "And the event is relatively rare: Ring plane crossings \u2014 as the phenomenon is known \u2014 typically occur twice during the 29.4 years it takes Saturn to make one orbit around the sun. This means they can be seen from Earth about once every 13 to 15 years.",
      "Unfortunately, however, Saturn will be too close to the sun this weekend for skywatchers to see how it looks without its rings. But another opportunity will come later this year, on Nov. 23, when the rings will be nearly edge-on (though not precisely).",
      "Walker said he witnessed a ring plane crossing in 1995, using a backyard telescope.",
      "\u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looked like a different planet. I spent a good part of the night just drinking in that view.\u201d",
      "It was around that time, he said, when he was just starting to become interested in astronomy.",
      "In addition to being a quirky product of geometry, a ring plane crossing also happens because of the structure of Saturn\u2019s rings. The iconic accessories are made up of billions of swirling chunks of rock and ice but are relatively flat, which is why the rings can seem to disappear into a thin line when tilted edge-on to Earth.",
      "The edge-on view also makes it easier to see more of Saturn\u2019s moons, Walker said.",
      "\u201cWhen we have these ring plane crossings, the light that normally reflects off Saturn\u2019s rings is no longer glaring back toward Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you can detect a lot more of the smaller moons.\u201d",
      "With a regular backyard telescope, Walker said, people can often spot four to six moons around Saturn. During a ring plane crossing in the dark sky, people may be able to detect nearly a dozen.",
      "\u201cThe really faint ones become apparent because they line up in almost a perfect line,\u201d he said.",
      "After this weekend\u2019s ring plane crossing, the next full one will take place in 2038. That event should be visible from Earth, according to Walker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see it again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a little while to wait.\u201d"

      "His case has become a test of the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to combat antisemitism and deport noncitizen college activists who the Department of Homeland Security said \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York ruled Wednesday that Khalil\u2019s legal challenge to his detention should proceed in federal court in New Jersey, where he was briefly held when his attorneys filed a petition alleging his arrest and detention violated his right to due process and his First Amendment right to free speech.",
      "Furman said his order blocking the government from deporting Khalil will remain in effect as the case proceeds.",
      "Khalil, 30, who holds a green card granting him permanent residency in the U.S., is being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center,\u00a0more than 1,000 miles from his home in New York City. His legal team is trying to get him released.",
      "Khalil has a separate deportation case in Louisiana, where he appeared for a brief court hearing Friday as his lawyers challenged his arrest and detention, arguing the government\u2019s decision to send him away to the remote facility in Jena, Louisiana, impeded their ability to represent him.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to fight just as hard for Mr. Khalil in the district of New Jersey,\u201d said Amy Greer, a lawyer for Khalil. \u201cHe was taken by plainclothes federal agents, transferred in the middle of the night across state lines, and has been detained for over a week now, all because of his advocacy for Palestinian freedom.\u201d",
      "His lawyers have also said that Khalil should be released because he and his wife, Noor Abdalla, a U.S. citizen, are awaiting the birth of their first child next month. Khalil is an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent.",
      "The Trump administration said Khalil was moved to Louisiana because detention centers in the Northeast are overcrowded and there was a bedbug infestation at the New Jersey detention center where he was held after he was arrested March 8 outside his apartment.",
      "Khalil said in a court declaration on Monday that when he was at the detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, for a night, he \u201cdid not hear anyone mention bedbugs.\u201d He also said it appeared that other people processed at the site around the same time as he was were allowed to remain in New Jersey.The Trump administration argues that Khalil should be deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows noncitizens to be deported if the secretary of state determines their presence in the United States could adversely affect foreign policy.",
      "Khalil is not facing any publicly known criminal charges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost unprecedented to invoke a provision like this,\u201d said Marc Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout, one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThe government is clearly going after him because they don\u2019t like what he says about what\u2019s going on in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "At Friday\u2019s hearing in immigration court in Louisiana, Khalil\u2019s legal team was allowed more time to review the case before both parties return on April 8. Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout attended the hearing via video conference.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Khalil \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on March 11 that Khalil organized protests that disrupted the campus, harassed Jewish students and distributed pro-Hamas propaganda.",
      "Samah Sisay, another lawyer for Khalil, denied the Trump administration\u2019s claims, saying there is no evidence he provided support of any kind to a terrorist organization.",
      "Sisay told NBC News on Monday that regardless of where the case challenging his arrest will play out, \u201cour ultimate goal is to get our client out\u201d and to continue fighting for Khalil\u2019s release.",
      "\u201cEvery day that Khalil is in detention is justice denied,\u201d Sisay said. \u201cHe should not continue to be punished for the government\u2019s unlawful action. He can be released while fighting this.\u201d",
      "Sisay said Khalil\u2019s continued incarceration could also have major health risks for his wife\u2019s pregnancy with the \u201cimmense stress that\u2019s being put on her.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/kennedy-cell-phone-bans-schools-rcna197347",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda: cell phones in schools.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda: cell phones in schools.",
      "In an interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Thursday, Kennedy praised cell phone restrictions in schools and listed health hazards that he said were linked to phone use among children and teens\u00a0 \u2014 some backed by scientific research, others less so.",
      "Kennedy cited established links between social media use and depression and poor school performance. But he also suggested that cell phones \u201cproduce electromagnetic radiation, which has been shown to do neurological damage to kids when it\u2019s around them all day, and to cause cellular damage and even cancer.\u201d",
      "Studies have found that excessive use of social media via smartphones can negatively impact teens\u2019 mental health, elevating their risk of depression and anxiety. Scientists have also long understood that cell phone use in school can lead to poor academic performance, including lower grades.",
      "However, the bulk of research so far has found no association between cell phone use and cancer, nor evidence that cell phones damage DNA. Cell phones emit radio frequency radiation, which has far less energy than ionizing radiation, such as that released by medical X-rays.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s statements follow a pattern of his, in which he mixes misinformation with scientific fact. Some of the issues he has highlighted during his first five-plus weeks in office, such as reducing chronic disease in children and warning of the dangers of ultraprocessed food, have broad support among the public and many scientists. But certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems and some of his proposed solutions \u2014\u00a0such as substituting beef tallow for seed oils in fast food \u2014 are not backed by research.",
      "So, too, for cell phones in schools. Restricting their use is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Vivek Murthy, while he was surgeon general under the Biden Administration last year, called on schools to get rid of phones in the classroom. Nine states have already enacted such bans or restrictions, and 15 states and Washington, D.C. have introduced legislation to do so, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank.",
      "\u201cBoth in red states and blue states, there\u2019s a lot of concern about kids and cell phones, so I do think that there is bipartisan support on this,\u201d said Annette Campbell Anderson, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.",
      "However, there\u2019s no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cell phone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of low-quality research in the literature that, if you wanted to collect all that and put it together, it would look very damning,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many activist groups out there that promote those studies and say that that\u2019s the truth.\u201d",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What Kennedy says, and what studies say",
      "Kennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims about the physical harms of cell phone use in the past, including on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast last year.",
      "At his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy also told Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., that he stood by his past statements that WiFi radiation causes cancer, saying that he had \u201cwon a case in front of the Court of Appeals against the FCC on that very issue.\u201d",
      "The anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, Children\u2019s Health Defense, challenged the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s decision not to review its 1996 health and safety guidelines for wireless-based technologies. An appeals court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the FCC to explain how its guidelines protect against potentially harmful health effects. However, that case was about health issues unrelated to cancer, and the court did not take a position on the potential health effects of cell phone radiation.",
      "Research thus far has been \u201cvery reassuring\u201d about cell phone safety, Bushberg said.",
      "Most studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cell phones could increase the risk of brain tumors, given that people often hold their phone by their head while talking. But overall brain cancer rates haven\u2019t risen as cell phones have become more widely used. And a large study among children found no association between wireless phone use and brain tumors.",
      "The National Cancer Institute, Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 agencies that Kennedy now oversees \u2014 have all said there\u2019s not enough scientific evidence to associate cell phone use with cancer. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic, meaning it cannot rule out a causal link.",
      "Several questions remain, said David McCormick, a biology professor at Illinois Institute of Technology.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly clear that Mr. Kennedy doesn\u2019t necessarily pay much attention to the bulk of the scientific data that is out there. That said, it\u2019s not impossible that there are health effects from people using cell phones,\u201d he said.",
      "In a 2017 study, McCormick and his fellow researchers exposed rodents to radio frequency radiation and found a possible increased rate of certain tumors \u2014 however, findings in lab animals don\u2019t necessarily apply to humans, given the many biological differences, and the studies contained limitations that prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions.",
      "A decade earlier, a study looked at cell phone use among more than 5,000 people with brain tumors and found a possible increased risk of tumors in the 10% who used their phones the most. But the research relied on people\u2019s memories about past phone use, which aren\u2019t always reliable, so its results (like those of similar studies) are hard to interpret.",
      "Cell phone use has also changed in recent years, McCormick said, which could affect exposure. Whereas studies thus far have mainly looked at the effects of 2G or 3G mobile signals, higher-frequency 5G networks are common today. And people now text as much if not more than they call, so there\u2019s potentially less radiation near the brain.",
      "The pros and cons of cell phone bans",
      "Despite bipartisan support for cell phone restrictions in schools, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like.",
      "Phones can have life-saving benefits \u2014 for instance, by allowing children to call 911 \u2014 so some parents worry that outright bans could jeopardize their child\u2019s safety. Anderson said policymakers have to weigh those concerns against risks to kids\u2019 mental health and their ability to focus in the classroom.",
      "\u201cPart of what schools are trying to do is figure out how to wrest back control over what happened in their school climates because of the phone \u2014 everything from using the phone to tape fights and incidents that happen in schools to kids using them to make TikToks,\u201d she said.",
      "The right approach likely differs from school to school, she added \u2014 for instance, in schools where cell phones are the only internet-connected device, a ban may make less sense.",
      "In his interview on Thursday, Kennedy applauded Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who last year issued an executive order directing the state\u2019s education department to draft guidance for public schools to restrict or eliminate phone use and set aside $500,000 to fund those efforts. Kennedy visited a Virginia high school on Monday that adopted the change, which he said students and teachers there have welcomed.",
      "\u201cThe states that are doing this have found that it is a much healthier environment when kids are not using cell phones in schools,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "However, prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy suggested that although he personally supports getting phones out of schools, parents and teachers should make their own decisions.",
      "\u201cDo we really want the government to decide when, where, and how we communicate?\u201d he wrote on X in 2023."

    "story": [
      "Marco Rubio has long been a fierce critic of dictatorial leaders who have stifled speech in their countries and crushed opposition. As a senator, he spearheaded legislation and condemned \u201cthe ongoing repression of dissent\u201d in his parents\u2019 native Cuba and repeatedly called for \u201cexpression not repression\u201d in countries like Venezuela.",
      "But now as secretary of state, he\u2019s at the center of the government\u2019s recent actions to deny visa holders entry into the U.S. or arrest and try to deport people, including a green card holder married to a U.S. citizen. Critics of the administration\u2019s measures and those involved in the cases have said they were targeted because of their speech, their support for Palestinians or their criticism of Trump administration policies.",
      "Rubio dismissed backlash last week over the arrest and attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University. \u201cThis is not about free speech.\u00a0This is about people that don\u2019t have a right to be in the United States to begin with,\u201d Rubio told reporters on March 12. \u201cNo one has a right to a student visa.\u00a0No one has a right to a green card, by the way.\u201d",
      "As secretary of state, Rubio has the right to revoke a green card or a visa under a 1952 immigration law, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt recently told reporters, though legal scholars say the government has to prove why it\u2019s warranted.",
      "Some experts who have followed Rubio\u2019s career see a dissonance between his actions as secretary of state and what he advocated as a senator, especially his intolerance for political repression, undercutting his authority to demand the restoration of democratic freedoms elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rank hypocrisy,\u201d said Daniel Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Drezner, who has written about Rubio\u2019s political evolution, said the secretary of state has done a \u201c180\u201d-degree turn from what he\u2019s stood for in his political career.",
      "Drezner said Rubio\u2019s hawkishness toward Latin America, and particularly Cuba, is a constant in his political career. \u201cMaybe the thought is he\u2019s saying and doing things that contradict the substance of his critique of Cuba,\u201d Drezner said, \u201cbut if by doing that, he still gets to critique Cuba and have Donald Trump agree with him, maybe that in itself, in Rubio\u2019s mind, may be worth it.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no shortage of video, transcripts and legislative action in which Rubio defends democratic principles such as freedom of assembly and vilifies countries that repress those freedoms.",
      "After Sen. Tim Kaine discussed on the Senate floor his trip to Cuba in 2014 \u2014 the year then-President Barack Obama normalized relations with the country \u2014\u00a0Rubio responded with a searing speech saying Cuba was \u201cgood at repression\u201d and exporting it to places like Venezuela. He cited the example of Leopoldo Lopez, the former mayor of Caracas. \u201cHe\u2019s sitting in jail right now because he\u2019s protesting against the government,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "In 2022, Rubio protested Cuba\u2019s participation in the ninth Summit of the Americas because its president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, had \u201ccriminalized criticism\u201d of the government.",
      "In response to questions from NBC News, a State Department spokesperson repeated Rubio\u2019s comments that the issue isn\u2019t about free speech, adding\u00a0that while the department doesn\u2019t discuss individual visa cases, all visa applicants \u201care continuously vetted\u201d by the government.",
      "\u2018Sends a clear message\u2019",
      "Although not directly critical of Rubio, the founder of a U.S.-based group that monitors human rights in Cuba said she\u2019s wary of what she\u2019s seeing happening in the U.S.",
      "The arrests of the immigrant protesters and academics \u201cis a step backwards in human rights but also in democracy,\u201d said Laritza Diversent, founder of Cubalex, adding it\u00a0\u201csends a clear message: Be careful what you say on social media, or you can be next.\u201d",
      "Diversent grew up in Cuba under Fidel Castro and fled in 2017 when Cubalex, then a Havana-based legal group, became a target of government intimidation.",
      "Dictatorships use the strategy of denying dissenters entry to their countries, she said. If she tried to fly to Cuba for an emergency, the government might deny her entry, as has happened throughout the communist government\u2019s history, including what happened to the late famed singer Celia Cruz. She was denied entry to Cuba multiple times, including when her mother was dying.",
      "Regarding the recent Trump administration actions, \u201cthis is the first step towards a society becoming silent before abuses, where people don\u2019t dare say what they think to avoid certain consequences,\u201d Diversent said.",
      "Concerns over the visa denials and arrests are not confined to Cuban exiles. Juan Carlos Avita, 19, an aerospace engineering student in Elroy, Arizona, said he cast his first presidential ballot for Trump in November, hoping he\u2019d usher in a new economy.",
      "But the Mexican American student said he\u2019s disturbed by the clamping down on free speech and the right to protest. He accepts the need to take steps against those who commit violence, but said immigrants \u201cbring unique perspectives from across the world\u201d that maybe that could enrich Americans, he said, \u201cas long as they\u2019re following the other laws. They\u2019re not hurting anyone physically. They\u2019re not damaging private property.\u201d",
      "Rubio \u201cshouldn\u2019t be two-faced when it comes to America, especially [on] Palestine,\u201d said Avita, who said he\u2019s come to \u201cthink I made a mistake\u201d when he voted for Trump.",
      "Daniel Pedreira, a visiting assistant teaching professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University, said the steps taken by the U.S. and Rubio\u2019s role in them are distinct from what has occurred in countries with repressive governments, because the U.S. continues to have a separation of powers.",
      "Khalil\u2019s case is in the courts and a judge has blocked the deportation of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown graduate student from India, who was picked up by immigration agents and accused of spreading Hamas propaganda. Suri\u2019s lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, denied Thursday that Suri ever made pro-Hamas or antisemitic statements. In Cuba or Venezuela, Pedreira noted, there would be no pushback or chance for appeal.",
      "Immigration law has allowed the deportations of legal residents, visa holders or foreign tourists for a number of crimes, including crimes involving \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d Homeland Security, law enforcement and border officials have long had to balance public safety with international immigration and cross-border commerce.",
      "No contradiction",
      "John Suarez, executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba, said the Florida Cuban community has seen terrorists and spies infiltrating the U.S. and torturers and prison guards from Cuba getting legal residence. He noted the recent arrest of Tomas Emilio Hernandez Cruz, 71, a former high-ranking official in the Cuban intelligence service.",
      "Suarez, who\u2019s also a human rights activist, said his organization ardently supports\u00a0free speech, \u201ceven speech we find repugnant,\u201d he said. But he also said he does not see a contradiction in Rubio\u2019s actions and his record challenging repressive regimes because the secretary of state has said that he\u2019s targeting people who \u201coccupy university buildings and vandalize them and tear them apart, and hold campuses hostage.\u201d",
      "Rubio still enjoys strong support in Florida\u2019s Cuban American community, Suarez said. The secretary of state was greeted warmly by the community at the recent funeral for Lincoln D\u00edaz Balart, the former congressman, which Suarez also attended.",
      "Back in Arizona, 64-year-old Eric Busch of Phoenix, a Trump supporter in 2016, 2020 and 2024, said he has respected U.S. laws since coming to the country from Chile. \u201cYou\u2019re here on a tourist visa, a student visa or business, you have to respect the law,\u201d said Busch, a semitruck salesman and naturalized citizen.",
      "He said he agreed with Rubio on Khalil\u2019s case. \u201cHe should respect the law and be peacefully protesting. This guy is not peaceful,\u201d Busch said of Khalil, adding, \u201cIf the Cubans want to come and do the same, they should be kicked out as well, or Chileans. I don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "But the history of Cuba\u2019s slide to authoritarianism, from the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista to Castro\u2019s communist takeover and the party\u2019s ongoing control should be familiar to Rubio \u2014 and one that should be taken seriously, according to a scholar of Cuban history.",
      "When Castro took power in 1959, he relied on mob mentality and portrayed conditions as \u201cblack and white\u201d to ensure that \u201che and his power and those loyal to him would predominate,\u201d said Lillian Guerra, a professor of Cuban and Caribbean history at the University of Florida.",
      "\u201cMarco Rubio as secretary of state should be very aware of the history of the rise of authoritarianism in Cuba and how that really dismantled more than 100 years of the struggle for democracy on the island, as well as the lessons of how Fidel Castro managed to centralize authority and create authoritarianism \u2014 the strategies, the means, the enabling,\u201d Guerra said.",
      "\u201cAll of those things are very close to his history,\u201d Guerra said of Rubio. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he could sanction what seems to be happening at all levels of the Trump administration.\u201d"

All units earned by a conference\u2019s members during a women\u2019s tournament will be paid by the NCAA to the conference, which then splits up the pool of money and redistributes it back to the schools over the next three years.",
      "At stake this year are 132 units worth a combined $15 million, meaning that if No. 1 overall seed UCLA advances to the championship game, it would earn the Big Ten conference $1.3 million to be paid out through 2028. (Conferences use different methods to decide which schools receive how much.) That pool available for tournament teams will grow to $20 million in 2026, $25 million in 2027 and increase by 2.9% annually after that, the same rate as other Division I funds.",
      "There\u2019s a reason why the NCAA landed on this unit-based system: It is the same one that\u2019s been used to reward men\u2019s teams in the NCAA Tournament since 1991.",
      "Between 1997 and 2018, the combined units earned by men\u2019s teams from the Big Ten Conference alone raked in an estimated $340 million, according to a 2019 analysis by The Associated Press.",
      "During the same span, meanwhile, women\u2019s basketball teams including powerhouses Connecticut, Tennessee and South Carolina earned zilch.",
      "Among the numerous books on sports written by Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, is 1999\u2019s \u201cUnpaid Professionals: Commercialism and Conflict in Big-Time College Sports,\u201d in which he argued for the NCAA to adopt a unit-based payment system for women\u2019s basketball. Zimbalist told NBC News that when Myles Brand was the NCAA president from 2003 to 2009, he had spoken with Brand about fixing what he called the discriminatory disparity that saw men\u2019s teams, but not their women\u2019s counterparts, paid for their performance.",
      "\u201cIt never had any justification,\u201d Zimbalist said.",
      "More from NCAA Tournament",
      "No. 2 Alabama survives scare from No. 15 Robert Morris in first round of NCAA TournamentThe March Madness bracket may have started at a Staten Island pubPaige Bueckers, JuJu Watkins headline players to watch in women\u2019s NCAA Tournament",
      "No. 2 Alabama survives scare from No. 15 Robert Morris in first round of NCAA Tournament",
      "The March Madness bracket may have started at a Staten Island pub",
      "Paige Bueckers, JuJu Watkins headline players to watch in women\u2019s NCAA Tournament",
      "Why did it take 34 years to fix? The longtime argument against such a move \u2014 that the men\u2019s tournament drew more viewers and was thus more valuable \u2014 ignored that the women\u2019s tournament nonetheless also drew millions of viewers as well, and could have drawn even more had it been marketed equally to the men\u2019s, Zimbalist said.",
      "\u201cIt never would have made any sense to say that women should get paid zero, because the women in fact were attracting customers and revenue,\u201d he said.",
      "That 34-year gap between the first tournament payouts for men and women was why in January, when an NCAA council approved a fund to start the payments, Danielle Donehew, the executive director of the Women\u2019s Basketball Coaches Association, called it a \u201cmomentous victory\u201d that was \u201cthe culmination of decades of hard work.\u201d",
      "That victory arrived, in part, because of pressure. In 2021, women\u2019s basketball players taking part in the NCAA Tournament documented on social media the disparities in how they were treated compared to the men, ranging from paltry weight rooms to meager gift bags. With players agitating for equal treatment and the public asking questions, the NCAA hired a law firm to conduct a gender equity assessment. The findings, released in 2021, were scathing.",
      "\u201cThe NCAA\u2019s broadcast agreements, corporate sponsorship contracts, distribution of revenue, organizational structure, and culture all prioritize Division I men\u2019s basketball over everything else in ways that create, normalize, and perpetuate gender inequities,\u201d wrote the firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP.",
      "The NCAA instituted a few changes immediately, such as allowing the women\u2019s tournament to finally use \u201cMarch Madness\u201d in its marketing, after previously limiting its use solely to the men\u2019s tournament. Four years after the Kaplan report, there were indications last summer that unit-based payouts were coming to women\u2019s basketball. And when they were officially approved in January, the NCAA attempted to reward women according a standard equal to or better than the men, whose units earnings are paid out over a six-year period.",
      "The fund that pays out units in the women\u2019s basketball tournament is capped at $15 million this year because it represents 26% of the NCAA\u2019s annual revenue from the media rights deal it inked with ESPN to broadcast the women\u2019s tournament, the same percentage men\u2019s teams drew in 1991. Men\u2019s teams in the tournament currently take in a slightly lower percentage of annual revenue, about 24%.",
      "Still, the total pool of money available to be earned by men\u2019s teams in the tournament this year is over $200 million more than the women\u2019s pool. Where a unit in the women\u2019s tournament will be valued at around $114,000 this year, a unit in the men\u2019s tournament is worth around $2 million.",
      "The reason? Television.",
      "It wasn\u2019t a coincidence that men\u2019s teams began earning payouts in 1991; that year, CBS began a six-year agreement, valued at $1 billion at the time, to exclusively broadcast the men\u2019s tournament.",
      "Revenue from the rights to broadcast the Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament have skyrocketed since. Last year alone, the NCAA\u2019s deal granting CBS and Turner the rights to broadcast the men\u2019s basketball tournament brought in $950 million \u2014 the lion\u2019s share of the NCAA\u2019s $1.3 billion in revenue, according to financial statements. Next year, the deal alone will pay the NCAA more than $1 billion \u2014 bringing in more in one year than the NCAA will be paid over the entire life of its current eight-year, $920 million contract with ESPN to air the women\u2019s basketball tournament along with the championships of more than 20 other NCAA sports.",
      "The NCAA could have broken off the women\u2019s basketball tournament into its own media rights deal, but opted to keep it as part of a larger package. The women\u2019s tournament portion of that package is valued at about $65 million annually, NCAA President Charlie Baker told the AP last year.",
      "\u201cYes, it\u2019s a bundle,\u201d Baker said at the time, \u201cbut it\u2019s a bigger bundle and it\u2019s a bigger bundle that will be much better.\u201d",
      "Fueled by the popularity of then-Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark facing dynastic South Carolina, last year\u2019s women\u2019s NCAA championship game drew a record 18.7 million viewers \u2014 4 million more than the men\u2019s title game, making it the most watched basketball game since 2019, including the NBA.",
      "\u201cIf you want to go back to this historical argument and say, \u2018Oh, we should remunerate based upon the value that they create,\u2019 then women should be getting paid more this year than the men, not 1/15th the value of the men,\u201d Zimbalist said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s highway robbery. It\u2019s the worst example of exploitation of women that you can imagine. So they wait 34 years, and then they finally give them crumbs. And I don\u2019t know what Charlie Baker thinks he\u2019s doing, but I think it\u2019s totally unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Whether the enormous difference in the value of units between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments can be narrowed won\u2019t be known until 2032, when the media rights deals for both tournaments next come up for bidding. Packaging the women\u2019s basketball tournament in that bundle with other NCAA championships undervalued the women\u2019s tournament, according to the 2021 Kaplan report, whose analysis suggested the rights for the women\u2019s basketball tournament alone could have sold for $81-$112 million in 2025. Yet the NCAA opted to keep women\u2019s basketball as part of that larger bundle when it reupped its deal with ESPN last year.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate question would have been in the NCAA\u2019s mind and their consultants\u2019 mind is, \u2018OK, if we sell the NCAA women\u2019s tournament with all the other events, we\u2019re going to get X. If we sell the women\u2019s tournament alone and the other championship events, we\u2019re going to get X plus Y. Well, is that number going to be bigger than if we just sold them all together?\u2019\u201d said Bob Thompson, a former television executive at Fox Sports who now runs his own consulting firm, Thompson Sports Group.",
      "\u201cAnd they could face the possibility that someone would say, \u2018I want the women\u2019s tournament, I don\u2019t want anything else,\u2019 and then those events, they\u2019re sort of sitting there off by themselves, and is anybody going to really go after them? And for the NCAA, it\u2019s extremely important that those events see the light of day and are on television, and is on as broad-based television as possible, which is why I think they\u2019re very happy with the ESPN deal and putting the entirety of it on ESPN.\u201d",
      "Experts are watching to see in the future whether the NCAA will spin off the women\u2019s tournament into its own media rights package, combine it with the men\u2019s tournament or keep it in a bundle.",
      "Within women\u2019s basketball, the drastic difference in value between men\u2019s and women\u2019s payouts is noted. But having them at all, starting this year, was described by Duke coach Kara Lawson in January as a \u201cstep forward that is really valuable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf your sport proves itself to be a moneymaker in this environment,\u201d Lawson said, \u201call of the constituents of that sport get rewarded.\u201d"

      "After an exciting open to the men\u2019s bracket of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday, the second round begins Saturday with some tantalizing matchups. Old coaching rivals will reunite, a Cinderella will try to continue its run, No. 1 seeds will be in action and much more.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of all the action as teams try to clinch a spot in the Sweet 16.",
      "No. 12 McNeese State vs. No. 4 Purdue (12:10 p.m. ET)",
      "The upset of the tournament so far belongs to the McNeese State Cowboys, who held on for a 69-67 win over fifth-seeded Clemson in the first round. The Cowboys pulled off the shocker in large part due to their defense, which held the Tigers to only 13 points in the first half.",
      "The Boilermakers, on the other hand, more or less cruised to a victory over High Point to begin the tournament. Purdue will have to make sure not to underestimate McNeese State the same way Clemson did.",
      "No. 10 Arkansas vs. No. 2 St John\u2019s (2:40 p.m. ET)",
      "If there were ever a matchup to watch simply for the coaches on the sideline, it\u2019s this one. John Calipari\u2019s Arkansas Razorbacks will take on Rick Pitino\u2019s St John\u2019s Red Storm in a battle of not only former national champions, but former Kentucky coaches as well.",
      "Pitino\u2019s success at St. John's is one of the more compelling stories of the season, as the storied (and there are lots of stories) coach is trying to make a Final Four with his fourth different team. Meanwhile, Calipari is doing one of his finest coaching jobs in years, and already led the Razorbacks to an upset over Kansas in the first round.",
      "No. 5 Michigan vs. No. 4 Texas A&M (5:15 p.m. ET)",
      "The Aggies are slightly favored in this matchup, as the Wolverines are coming off a near-upset in the first round. Michigan was pushed to the limit by UC San Diego, which made a furious second-half comeback and missed a game-tying 3-pointer in the waning seconds of a 68-65 loss. Texas A&M could have its hands full with Michigan center Danny Wolf, however, as the 7-footer is one of the more skilled players taking the floor Saturday.",
      "No. 11 Drake vs. No. 3 Texas Tech (6:10 p.m. ET)",
      "The Bulldogs pulled off a stunner on Thursday, knocking off No. 6 Missouri in a rebuke of the SEC\u2019s regular season dominance. The Red Raiders, meanwhile, cruised to a 10-point victory over UNC Wilmington thanks to historical shooting from deep. Keep an eye on Drake guard Bennett Stirtz, who scored 21 points in upset over the Tigers. Stirtz has already led one upset, and has the scoring ability to lead another.",
      "No. 9 Creighton vs. No. 1 Auburn (7:10 p.m. ET)",
      "The Bluejays led nearly wire-to-wire in their win over Louisville in round one. The Tigers had an even easier time, dispatching Alabama State 83-63. This game should be more competitive for each squad. It will also feature a throwback big-man battle between Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner, a March Madness veteran, and Auburn forward Johni Broome, a Naismith Trophy semifinalist.",

      "No. 6 BYU vs. No. 3 Wisconsin (7:45 p.m. ET)",
      "This could be the closest matchup of the day, as the Badgers are only very slight favorites against the Cougars. Could this be a big moment for Wisconsin guard John Tonje? The sixth-year player is in his first season with the Badgers and had a relatively quiet 15 points in the first round. Having his best season in college, Tonje (plus backcourt mate John Blackwell) will be who BYU has to slow down to advance.",
      "No. 8 Gonzaga vs. No. 1 Houston (8:40 p.m. ET)",
      "Both teams blew out their opening-round opponent, though the Bulldogs\u2019 manhandling of Georgia was a little more surprising than the Cougars\u2019 dismantling of SIU Edwardsville. (Fun fact, both teams played an opponent with the same team name in the Round of 64.)",
      "The stylistic clash in the backcourt will be a fun subplot in this game. Houston\u2019s L.J. Cryer is not afraid to let it fly from deep, connecting on 42.3% of his 7.0 3-pointers a night. Gonzaga\u2019s Ryan Nembhard, meanwhile, is a true point guard, leading the nation in assists with 9.8 per game.",
      "No. 7 UCLA vs. No. 2 Tennessee (9:40 p.m. ET)",
      "The nightcap on Saturday\u2019s action should be a fun one. The Bruins and Volunteers each cruised in their first tournament game, but now the competition increases significantly. Can UCLA handle Tennessee\u2019s one-two punch of Chaz Lanier and Zakai Zeigler in the backcourt? Lanier is a score-first guard who is bombs away from deep, while Zeigler is one of the peskiest defenders in the country."

      "Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, although recent research suggests that the United States is backsliding in efforts to detect the disease early, when it is most curable.",
      "A new study shows that the percentage of women screened for cervical cancer fell from 47% in 2019 to 41% in 2023.",
      "Rural women are 25% more likely to be diagnosed and 42% more likely to die from cervical cancer than women who live in cities, a trend that likely reflects lower screening rates in less populated areas, according to the study, published in JAMA Network Open this month.",
      "Every year, 13,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer, which is almost always caused by HPV, or human papillomavirus. About 4,320 die each year, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "Cervical cancer rates have been edging upward among women in their 30s and early 40s, perhaps because women ages 21 to 29 are the least likely to be up to date on their screenings, with 29% being overdue.",
      "Cervical cancer takes several years to develop, progressing from abnormal cell changes and precancers before transforming into cancer. Studies show that women are also less likely to be screened if they are nonwhite, uninsured or identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual.",
      "HPV vaccines are safe and can prevent 90% of cervical cancers. Yet resistance to the vaccine, which protects against cancer-causing strains of the sexually transmitted infection, has persisted since it was approved almost 20 years ago. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has disparaged them as dangerous, linking HPV shots to autoimmune conditions and mental illness.",
      "A federal judge in North Carolina on March 10 dismissed legal claims that the HPV shot, sold by Merck as Gardasil, could cause patients to develop certain health conditions.",
      "Another lawsuit alleging that Gardasil causes serious side effects has been put on hold until September because of Kennedy\u2019s involvement in the case. Although Kennedy disclosed in an ethics statement that he stood to receive referral fees from one of the law firms suing Merck, he later said he would give any earnings to his son.",
      "Vaccine hesitancy has kept many parents from vaccinating their children. Only 61% of adolescents are up to date on all HPV vaccines, given as a series of two or three shots depending on age.",
      "More than 42 million people in the U.S. carry at least one strain of HPV that can cause disease, including genital warts or cancer, and 47,00 a year are diagnosed with an HPV-linked malignancy. Yet research has found a decline in awareness that HPV is linked with a number of cancers, including cervical, throat and anal.",
      "With so many people at risk, we asked experts\u00a0 to help clear up confusion over HPV vaccination and screening.",
      "How often should women be screened for cervical cancer?",
      "The American Cancer Society recommends that people have a primary HPV test every five years from ages 25 to 65. If primary HPV testing is not available, the society recommends either combining an HPV test with a Pap test every five years or a Pap test alone every three years",
      "How have HPV vaccines affected rates of cervical cancer and precancer?",
      "Among women ages 20 to 24 \u2014 who were eligible for HPV shots as adolescents \u2014 the incidence of cervical precancer fell nearly 80% from 2008 to 2002, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cervical cancer incidence fell 65% from 2012 to 2019 among women under 25. Death rates from cervical cancer among the same age group fell 62% from 2013-2015 to 2019-2021.",
      "How common is HPV?",
      "HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Among sexually active people, more than 90% of men and 80% of women are infected with HPV during their lifetimes. About half of HPV infections involve high-risk strains. In addition to cervical cancer, HPV can cause cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis and head and neck.",
      "Given how common these viruses are, no one should feel embarrassed to learn they have HPV, said Dr. Rebecca Perkins, an obstetrician-gynecologist and investigator at the Woman, Mother and Baby Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center. \u201cWe need to decrease the stigma associated with having a positive test,\u201d Perkins said.",
      "What does it mean if a test shows you have high-risk HPV?",
      "Although there are more than 200 types of HPV, only a few cause cancer. These types are known as high-risk strains and are included in routine cervical cancer screenings, because they have the highest chance of causing cancer, said Dr. Verda Hicks, immediate past president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \u201cIf an HPV test is positive for high-risk HPV, it indicates an active infection that increases the risk for development of a pre-cancer or cancer,\u201d Hicks said.",
      "Does being infected with high-risk HPV give you a high risk of cancer?",
      "A. No. The immune system clears most HPV infections within a year or two, Hicks said. Most people with high-risk HPV experience short-term infections that cause mild changes in cervical cells, which return to normal once the infection clears.",
      "Doctors become more concerned if someone tests positive for high-risk HPV for longer than two years as persistent infections can lead to the development of a precancer or cancer.\u00a0 About 1% of people with HPV develop a \u201clong-term, chronic infection\u201d and even fewer develop cervical cancer, Hicks said.",
      "\u201cWomen should not freak out\u201d just because they have high-risk HPV, Hicks said. A positive test \u201cmeans the screening process is doing its job. It is identifying someone who possibly has a persistent infection.\u201d",
      "Undergoing routine screenings and any recommended follow-up tests allow doctors to catch these changes early, when they\u2019re easier to treat, Perkins said.",
      "That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential not to skip any checkups, she said.",
      "\u201cThe longer that someone remains positive, the higher the risk\u201d of developing cancer, Perkins said.",
      "How common are high-risk HPV infections?",
      "Among women screened for the first time in their 20s and 30s, up to 20% learn that they have high-risk HPV, said Dr. Mark Einstein, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and women\u2019s health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.",
      "What should people with high-risk HPV infections do?",
      "There\u2019s no blanket prescription for people with high-risk HPV, said Hicks, who noted that doctors tailor their advice for each individual, depending on a variety of risk factors.",
      "While people with high-risk HPV shouldn\u2019t panic, they should take the finding seriously, follow their doctor\u2019s advice and attend any recommended follow-up visits, she said. These visits allow doctors to look for abnormal cells, which can be removed before they turn into cancer.",
      "Can people who were vaccinated against HPV still test positive?",
      "Yes. That\u2019s because the original HPV shots, which were approved for children and adolescents in 2006, protected against the two riskiest viral strains, which together cause 70% of cervical cancer, as well as two strains that cause genital warts. Although the first HPV vaccines were very effective, people who were vaccinated with them could be infected with one of the HPV strains that cause the other 30% of cervical cancers, Perkins said. Updated HPV shots now protect against nine strains of the virus and protect against 90% of cervical and anal cancers, as well as most strains that cause mouth and throat cancers.",
      "Can you test positive for high-risk HPV years after being infected?",
      "Yes. A positive HPV test doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a recent infection.",
      "Although the immune system usually does a good job of controlling HPV, the virus doesn\u2019t disappear from the body. HPV can sometimes reactivate, especially if a person\u2019s immune system has been under stress due to an illness or certain medications, Perkins said.",

      "In some ways, HPV is similar to the chickenpox virus, which can hide in nerve cells for decades before reactivating and causing a painful condition called shingles.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the infection is old or new; we still need to follow up,\u201d Perkins said.",
      "Is there a cure for HPV?",
      "There\u2019s no cure for the virus itself. Health professionals can remove abnormal growths on the cervix, as well as genital warts."

    "summary": "For the first time since the NCAA began hosting a women\u2019s basketball tournament in 1982, teams will be paid for winning postseason games.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time since the NCAA began hosting a women\u2019s basketball tournament in 1982, a deep run through the bracket will produce more than bragging rights or a championship banner.",
      "Money is on the line, too.",
      "Every game that a school plays between the First Four through the Final Four \u2014 making the championship game doesn\u2019t count \u2014 will earn what the NCAA calls a \u201cunit,\u201d essentially one slice of the annual television revenue brought in from the NCAA\u2019s media rights deal to broadcast the tournament. All units earned by a conference\u2019s members during a women\u2019s tournament will be paid by the NCAA to the conference, which then splits up the pool of money and redistributes it back to the schools over the next three years.",
      "At stake this year are 132 units worth a combined $15 million, meaning that if No. 1 overall seed UCLA advances to the championship game, it would earn the Big Ten conference $1.3 million to be paid out through 2028. (Conferences use different methods to decide which schools receive how much.) That pool available for tournament teams will grow to $20 million in 2026, $25 million in 2027 and increase by 2.9% annually after that, the same rate as other Division I funds.",
      "There\u2019s a reason why the NCAA landed on this unit-based system: It is the same one that\u2019s been used to reward men\u2019s teams in the NCAA Tournament since 1991.",
      "Between 1997 and 2018, the combined units earned by men\u2019s teams from the Big Ten Conference alone raked in an estimated $340 million, according to a 2019 analysis by The Associated Press.",
      "During the same span, meanwhile, women\u2019s basketball teams including powerhouses Connecticut, Tennessee and South Carolina earned zilch.",
      "Among the numerous books on sports written by Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, is 1999\u2019s \u201cUnpaid Professionals: Commercialism and Conflict in Big-Time College Sports,\u201d in which he argued for the NCAA to adopt a unit-based payment system for women\u2019s basketball. Zimbalist told NBC News that when Myles Brand was the NCAA president from 2003 to 2009, he had spoken with Brand about fixing what he called the discriminatory disparity that saw men\u2019s teams, but not their women\u2019s counterparts, paid for their performance.",
      "\u201cIt never had any justification,\u201d Zimbalist said.",
      "More from NCAA Tournament",

      "No. 2 Alabama survives scare from No. 15 Robert Morris in first round of NCAA Tournament",
      "The March Madness bracket may have started at a Staten Island pub",
      "Paige Bueckers, JuJu Watkins headline players to watch in women\u2019s NCAA Tournament",
      "Why did it take 34 years to fix? The longtime argument against such a move \u2014 that the men\u2019s tournament drew more viewers and was thus more valuable \u2014 ignored that the women\u2019s tournament nonetheless also drew millions of viewers as well, and could have drawn even more had it been marketed equally to the men\u2019s, Zimbalist said.",
      "\u201cIt never would have made any sense to say that women should get paid zero, because the women in fact were attracting customers and revenue,\u201d he said.",
      "That 34-year gap between the first tournament payouts for men and women was why in January, when an NCAA council approved a fund to start the payments, Danielle Donehew, the executive director of the Women\u2019s Basketball Coaches Association, called it a \u201cmomentous victory\u201d that was \u201cthe culmination of decades of hard work.\u201d",
      "That victory arrived, in part, because of pressure. In 2021, women\u2019s basketball players taking part in the NCAA Tournament documented on social media the disparities in how they were treated compared to the men, ranging from paltry weight rooms to meager gift bags. With players agitating for equal treatment and the public asking questions, the NCAA hired a law firm to conduct a gender equity assessment. The findings, released in 2021, were scathing.",
      "\u201cThe NCAA\u2019s broadcast agreements, corporate sponsorship contracts, distribution of revenue, organizational structure, and culture all prioritize Division I men\u2019s basketball over everything else in ways that create, normalize, and perpetuate gender inequities,\u201d wrote the firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP.",
      "The NCAA instituted a few changes immediately, such as allowing the women\u2019s tournament to finally use \u201cMarch Madness\u201d in its marketing, after previously limiting its use solely to the men\u2019s tournament. Four years after the Kaplan report, there were indications last summer that unit-based payouts were coming to women\u2019s basketball. And when they were officially approved in January, the NCAA attempted to reward women according a standard equal to or better than the men, whose units earnings are paid out over a six-year period.",
      "The fund that pays out units in the women\u2019s basketball tournament is capped at $15 million this year because it represents 26% of the NCAA\u2019s annual revenue from the media rights deal it inked with ESPN to broadcast the women\u2019s tournament, the same percentage men\u2019s teams drew in 1991. Men\u2019s teams in the tournament currently take in a slightly lower percentage of annual revenue, about 24%.",
      "Still, the total pool of money available to be earned by men\u2019s teams in the tournament this year is over $200 million more than the women\u2019s pool. Where a unit in the women\u2019s tournament will be valued at around $114,000 this year, a unit in the men\u2019s tournament is worth around $2 million.",
      "The reason? Television.",
      "It wasn\u2019t a coincidence that men\u2019s teams began earning payouts in 1991; that year, CBS began a six-year agreement, valued at $1 billion at the time, to exclusively broadcast the men\u2019s tournament.",
      "Revenue from the rights to broadcast the Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament have skyrocketed since. Last year alone, the NCAA\u2019s deal granting CBS and Turner the rights to broadcast the men\u2019s basketball tournament brought in $950 million \u2014 the lion\u2019s share of the NCAA\u2019s $1.3 billion in revenue, according to financial statements. Next year, the deal alone will pay the NCAA more than $1 billion \u2014 bringing in more in one year than the NCAA will be paid over the entire life of its current eight-year, $920 million contract with ESPN to air the women\u2019s basketball tournament along with the championships of more than 20 other NCAA sports.",
      "The NCAA could have broken off the women\u2019s basketball tournament into its own media rights deal, but opted to keep it as part of a larger package. The women\u2019s tournament portion of that package is valued at about $65 million annually, NCAA President Charlie Baker told the AP last year.",
      "\u201cYes, it\u2019s a bundle,\u201d Baker said at the time, \u201cbut it\u2019s a bigger bundle and it\u2019s a bigger bundle that will be much better.\u201d",
      "Fueled by the popularity of then-Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark facing dynastic South Carolina, last year\u2019s women\u2019s NCAA championship game drew a record 18.7 million viewers \u2014 4 million more than the men\u2019s title game, making it the most watched basketball game since 2019, including the NBA.",
      "\u201cIf you want to go back to this historical argument and say, \u2018Oh, we should remunerate based upon the value that they create,\u2019 then women should be getting paid more this year than the men, not 1/15th the value of the men,\u201d Zimbalist said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s highway robbery. It\u2019s the worst example of exploitation of women that you can imagine. So they wait 34 years, and then they finally give them crumbs. And I don\u2019t know what Charlie Baker thinks he\u2019s doing, but I think it\u2019s totally unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Whether the enormous difference in the value of units between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments can be narrowed won\u2019t be known until 2032, when the media rights deals for both tournaments next come up for bidding. Packaging the women\u2019s basketball tournament in that bundle with other NCAA championships undervalued the women\u2019s tournament, according to the 2021 Kaplan report, whose analysis suggested the rights for the women\u2019s basketball tournament alone could have sold for $81-$112 million in 2025. Yet the NCAA opted to keep women\u2019s basketball as part of that larger bundle when it reupped its deal with ESPN last year.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate question would have been in the NCAA\u2019s mind and their consultants\u2019 mind is, \u2018OK, if we sell the NCAA women\u2019s tournament with all the other events, we\u2019re going to get X. If we sell the women\u2019s tournament alone and the other championship events, we\u2019re going to get X plus Y. Well, is that number going to be bigger than if we just sold them all together?\u2019\u201d said Bob Thompson, a former television executive at Fox Sports who now runs his own consulting firm, Thompson Sports Group.",
      "\u201cAnd they could face the possibility that someone would say, \u2018I want the women\u2019s tournament, I don\u2019t want anything else,\u2019 and then those events, they\u2019re sort of sitting there off by themselves, and is anybody going to really go after them? And for the NCAA, it\u2019s extremely important that those events see the light of day and are on television, and is on as broad-based television as possible, which is why I think they\u2019re very happy with the ESPN deal and putting the entirety of it on ESPN.\u201d",
      "Experts are watching to see in the future whether the NCAA will spin off the women\u2019s tournament into its own media rights package, combine it with the men\u2019s tournament or keep it in a bundle.",
      "Within women\u2019s basketball, the drastic difference in value between men\u2019s and women\u2019s payouts is noted. But having them at all, starting this year, was described by Duke coach Kara Lawson in January as a \u201cstep forward that is really valuable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf your sport proves itself to be a moneymaker in this environment,\u201d Lawson said, \u201call of the constituents of that sport get rewarded.\u201d"

      "U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York ruled Wednesday that Khalil\u2019s legal challenge to his detention should proceed in federal court in New Jersey, where he was briefly held when his attorneys filed a petition alleging his arrest and detention violated his right to due process and his First Amendment right to free speech.",
      "Furman said his order blocking the government from deporting Khalil will remain in effect as the case proceeds.",
      "Khalil, 30, who holds a green card granting him permanent residency in the U.S., is being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center,\u00a0more than 1,000 miles from his home in New York City. His legal team is trying to get him released.",
      "Khalil has a separate deportation case in Louisiana, where he appeared for a brief court hearing Friday as his lawyers challenged his arrest and detention, arguing the government\u2019s decision to send him away to the remote facility in Jena, Louisiana, impeded their ability to represent him.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to fight just as hard for Mr. Khalil in the district of New Jersey,\u201d said Amy Greer, a lawyer for Khalil. \u201cHe was taken by plainclothes federal agents, transferred in the middle of the night across state lines, and has been detained for over a week now, all because of his advocacy for Palestinian freedom.\u201d",
      "His lawyers have also said that Khalil should be released because he and his wife, Noor Abdalla, a U.S. citizen, are awaiting the birth of their first child next month. Khalil is an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent.",

      "Khalil said in a court declaration on Monday that when he was at the detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, for a night, he \u201cdid not hear anyone mention bedbugs.\u201d He also said it appeared that other people processed at the site around the same time as he was were allowed to remain in New Jersey.The Trump administration argues that Khalil should be deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows noncitizens to be deported if the secretary of state determines their presence in the United States could adversely affect foreign policy.",
      "Khalil is not facing any publicly known criminal charges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost unprecedented to invoke a provision like this,\u201d said Marc Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout, one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThe government is clearly going after him because they don\u2019t like what he says about what\u2019s going on in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "At Friday\u2019s hearing in immigration court in Louisiana, Khalil\u2019s legal team was allowed more time to review the case before both parties return on April 8. Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout attended the hearing via video conference.",

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda: cell phones in schools.",
      "In an interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Thursday, Kennedy praised cell phone restrictions in schools and listed health hazards that he said were linked to phone use among children and teens\u00a0 \u2014 some backed by scientific research, others less so.",
      "Kennedy cited established links between social media use and depression and poor school performance. But he also suggested that cell phones \u201cproduce electromagnetic radiation, which has been shown to do neurological damage to kids when it\u2019s around them all day, and to cause cellular damage and even cancer.\u201d",
      "Studies have found that excessive use of social media via smartphones can negatively impact teens\u2019 mental health, elevating their risk of depression and anxiety. Scientists have also long understood that cell phone use in school can lead to poor academic performance, including lower grades.",
      "However, the bulk of research so far has found no association between cell phone use and cancer, nor evidence that cell phones damage DNA. Cell phones emit radio frequency radiation, which has far less energy than ionizing radiation, such as that released by medical X-rays.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s statements follow a pattern of his, in which he mixes misinformation with scientific fact. Some of the issues he has highlighted during his first five-plus weeks in office, such as reducing chronic disease in children and warning of the dangers of ultraprocessed food, have broad support among the public and many scientists. But certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems and some of his proposed solutions \u2014\u00a0such as substituting beef tallow for seed oils in fast food \u2014 are not backed by research.",
      "So, too, for cell phones in schools. Restricting their use is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Vivek Murthy, while he was surgeon general under the Biden Administration last year, called on schools to get rid of phones in the classroom. Nine states have already enacted such bans or restrictions, and 15 states and Washington, D.C. have introduced legislation to do so, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank.",
      "\u201cBoth in red states and blue states, there\u2019s a lot of concern about kids and cell phones, so I do think that there is bipartisan support on this,\u201d said Annette Campbell Anderson, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.",
      "However, there\u2019s no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cell phone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of low-quality research in the literature that, if you wanted to collect all that and put it together, it would look very damning,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many activist groups out there that promote those studies and say that that\u2019s the truth.\u201d",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What Kennedy says, and what studies say",
      "Kennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims about the physical harms of cell phone use in the past, including on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast last year.",
      "At his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy also told Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., that he stood by his past statements that WiFi radiation causes cancer, saying that he had \u201cwon a case in front of the Court of Appeals against the FCC on that very issue.\u201d",
      "The anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, Children\u2019s Health Defense, challenged the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s decision not to review its 1996 health and safety guidelines for wireless-based technologies. An appeals court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the FCC to explain how its guidelines protect against potentially harmful health effects. However, that case was about health issues unrelated to cancer, and the court did not take a position on the potential health effects of cell phone radiation.",
      "Research thus far has been \u201cvery reassuring\u201d about cell phone safety, Bushberg said.",
      "Most studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cell phones could increase the risk of brain tumors, given that people often hold their phone by their head while talking. But overall brain cancer rates haven\u2019t risen as cell phones have become more widely used. And a large study among children found no association between wireless phone use and brain tumors.",
      "The National Cancer Institute, Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 agencies that Kennedy now oversees \u2014 have all said there\u2019s not enough scientific evidence to associate cell phone use with cancer. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic, meaning it cannot rule out a causal link.",
      "Several questions remain, said David McCormick, a biology professor at Illinois Institute of Technology.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly clear that Mr. Kennedy doesn\u2019t necessarily pay much attention to the bulk of the scientific data that is out there. That said, it\u2019s not impossible that there are health effects from people using cell phones,\u201d he said.",
      "In a 2017 study, McCormick and his fellow researchers exposed rodents to radio frequency radiation and found a possible increased rate of certain tumors \u2014 however, findings in lab animals don\u2019t necessarily apply to humans, given the many biological differences, and the studies contained limitations that prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions.",
      "A decade earlier, a study looked at cell phone use among more than 5,000 people with brain tumors and found a possible increased risk of tumors in the 10% who used their phones the most. But the research relied on people\u2019s memories about past phone use, which aren\u2019t always reliable, so its results (like those of similar studies) are hard to interpret.",
      "Cell phone use has also changed in recent years, McCormick said, which could affect exposure. Whereas studies thus far have mainly looked at the effects of 2G or 3G mobile signals, higher-frequency 5G networks are common today. And people now text as much if not more than they call, so there\u2019s potentially less radiation near the brain.",
      "The pros and cons of cell phone bans",
      "Despite bipartisan support for cell phone restrictions in schools, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like.",
      "Phones can have life-saving benefits \u2014 for instance, by allowing children to call 911 \u2014 so some parents worry that outright bans could jeopardize their child\u2019s safety. Anderson said policymakers have to weigh those concerns against risks to kids\u2019 mental health and their ability to focus in the classroom.",
      "\u201cPart of what schools are trying to do is figure out how to wrest back control over what happened in their school climates because of the phone \u2014 everything from using the phone to tape fights and incidents that happen in schools to kids using them to make TikToks,\u201d she said.",
      "The right approach likely differs from school to school, she added \u2014 for instance, in schools where cell phones are the only internet-connected device, a ban may make less sense.",
      "In his interview on Thursday, Kennedy applauded Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who last year issued an executive order directing the state\u2019s education department to draft guidance for public schools to restrict or eliminate phone use and set aside $500,000 to fund those efforts. Kennedy visited a Virginia high school on Monday that adopted the change, which he said students and teachers there have welcomed.",
      "\u201cThe states that are doing this have found that it is a much healthier environment when kids are not using cell phones in schools,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "However, prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy suggested that although he personally supports getting phones out of schools, parents and teachers should make their own decisions.",
      "\u201cDo we really want the government to decide when, where, and how we communicate?\u201d he wrote on X in 2023."

      "This week Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.",
      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0roots in the Soviet era when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sport, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.\u00a0As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada. \u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him.\u201d",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201dThroughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cping pong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming in his book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games, and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism as to whether the games will actually ever play out.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s sweeping federal layoffs aren\u2019t just wreaking havoc on tens of thousands of employees across the country.",
      "Lawmakers in both parties are warning the cuts will harm the government\u2019s ability to recruit young people out of college \u2014 as well as highly skilled candidates from the private sector \u2014 causing a ripple effect that could be felt for years or even decades.",
      "\u201cThe recruiting challenge they\u2019re creating for themselves is enormous,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., whose state is home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers, said of the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accidental byproduct. I think that\u2019s a known consequence \u2014 and they don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., whose state also borders Washington, D.C., and is home to thousands of federal employees, agreed with Kaine that DOGE\u2019s headline-grabbing, scorched-earth approach is designed, in part, to drive away the next generation of civil servants.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very worried that this will discourage talented young people from joining the federal service,\u201d Van Hollen, the son of two former federal workers, said in an interview. \u201cA lot of people who join the federal service do it for all the right reasons; they\u2019re patriots and they want to serve the country. And with the Musk-Trump approach, they\u2019re effectively terrorizing the federal civil service.\u201d",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said he, too, had concerns about the impact of cuts on recruitment efforts. A rare Republican voice on Capitol Hill who has questioned DOGE\u2019s hard-charging approach, Bacon told NBC News: \u201cDOGE has been good for showing where our money is being spent and some of the stupid projects that were funded. But it has been too rash in the firings. Better analysis needed to be done. It\u2019s not efficient to fire someone and then rehire.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying I learned. Measure twice, cut once,\u201d Bacon said.",
      "For many young people, particularly those attending college in and around the nation\u2019s capital, DOGE has been a live-fire exercise.",
      "One student at Georgetown University was hoping that her current internship at a federal agency would help her secure a full-time job there before she graduates in May. She found her work in the sciences rewarding and her co-workers \u201cbrilliant\u201d and inspiring.",
      "But in just two short months, the DOGE cuts and federal hiring freeze have upended her career plans. The student, who requested anonymity because she wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News she\u2019s now putting her dreams of working in government on hold and making a pivot to the private sector.",
      "\u201cI loved the work that I did so much and I could feel like it had a tangible impact on real people that I decided that I really wanted to work in the federal government,\u201d said the student, who asked that her name not be used and her agency not be identified.",
      "But she acknowledged: \u201cThe federal option isn\u2019t there. I mean, I\u2019m still holding out a little bit of hope for the federal hiring freeze to end in April, but I know that is probably not realistic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really trying to not follow the consulting, private-sector track of most Georgetown students, and I really thought the best way to do that was to go into the public sector,\u201d the student continued. \u201cBut now I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m probably just going to try to pivot into consulting, even though it\u2019s kind of late, or do tech.\u201d",
      "'Traumatically affected'",
      "Both Kaine and Van Hollen pointed to a 2023 speech by Russ Vought, now the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), where he said of federal bureaucrats that the goal of a second Trump administration would be to \u201cput them in trauma.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\u201d Vought said in a video of the speech obtained by ProPublica. \u201cWhen they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.\u201d",
      "\u201cRuss Vought was quite open about it,\u201d said Van Hollen, who added: \u201cUnfortunately, this will have a huge dampening effect on the ability to recruit.\u201d",
      "Asked about lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the government\u2019s ability to attract talented applicants in the future, White House spokesperson Liz Huston focused on the Cabinet members and other political appointees whom Trump has installed over the past two months.",
      "\u201cNever before in history has an administration hired such a huge number of qualified, capable, and America-first Patriots in such little time,\u201d Huston said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve broken records by selecting over 2,000 appointees in less than 2 months including incredible MAGA warriors like Russ Vought, Tom Homan, Sean Parnell, Harmeet Dhillon, Kash Patel, Kari Lake, Brent Bozell, and Jay Bhattacharya.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also touted the Trump administration\u2019s \u201csuccessful\u201d efforts to fill political jobs. She said 281 Trump appointees had been confirmed by the Senate so far, with another 280 in the process. And Leavitt said the administration had filled \u201c100%\u201d of the political slots at the White House, the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration.",
      "Still, those political appointees are a just a small slice of the 3 million-plus federal workforce. The overwhelming number of workers are career civil servants who traditionally remain in their jobs regardless of which party controls the White House.",
      "In addition to slashing agencies, Trump is also shutting down critical pipelines to federal careers. Started nearly a half century ago, the Presidential Management Fellows Program pairs current or recent graduate students with opportunities in the federal government, from the U.S. Agency for International Development to the National Forest Service.",
      "But on Feb. 19, Trump signed an executive order to \u201cpromptly terminate\u201d the competitive leadership development program, and its \u201ctalent management system\u201d is set to be \u201cdecommissioned\u201d at the end of this week, according to a message on the Office of Personnel Management website.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a federal governmentwide program that really draws very talented people into the federal government,\u201d Van Hollen said of the fellows program. \u201cSo I guess they don\u2019t want young people serving the country. I mean, that\u2019s the message they\u2019re sending.\u201d",
      "'They're telling them to pound sand'",
      "Arati Prabhakar, who served as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Biden administration, said the DOGE cuts are telling young people and those with highly skilled, technical backgrounds to \u201cpound sand.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible message,\u201d she said in a phone interview.",
      "During the Obama administration, Prabhakar led the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the research and development arm of the Defense Department. And she said a big part of her job was recruiting people from universities or from the private sector, where they were offered \u201cmuch higher salaries.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we got them, and they came in and they did great things. And the reason that they came is that the work was so exciting. \u2026 They have the ability at places like DARPA to address problems at scale. It was a place you could do big things, and you could do it for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes so much nurturing to find those few people, and then they make such a difference, and that\u2019s what\u2019s being disrupted. So, we\u2019ve got to get back on track.\u201d",
      "Prabhakar, now living in Silicon Valley, said she recently reconnected with a Stanford University student who had been her former intern in the White House.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s about to finish up in computer science, and what she wants to do is to bring this incredible AI expertise that she has into public service, and she even has an offer, but she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to stick in this current environment,\u201d Prabhakar explained.",
      "\u201cAnd you know what DOGE\u2019s actions are doing? Those actions are telling these immensely talented people who want to serve our country \u2014 they\u2019re telling them to pound sand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of what we should be doing ... to draw them in.\u201d"

    "summary": "Saturn\u2019s iconic rings will appear to be invisible starting this weekend because of the way the planet's tilt aligns with Earth's.",
    "story": [
      "Saturn\u2019s iconic rings will seem to \u201cdisappear\u201d for a couple of days starting this weekend \u2014 at least from our vantage point on Earth.",
      "The rings won\u2019t actually vanish, but for a short time, the angle between Earth and Saturn will create something of a cosmic illusion, making the planet\u2019s rings appear invisible from our point of view.",
      "The reason this occurs has to do with the specific tilts of both planets. Saturn\u2019s axis is tilted 26.73 degrees from vertical as it orbits the sun, which is similar to Earth\u2019s 23.5-degree tilt, according to NASA. So as each planet rotates on its axis and orbits the sun, Saturn\u2019s appearance, including its rings, can differ when viewed through telescopes or high-powered observatories on Earth.",
      "Occasionally, Saturn\u2019s angle of tilt toward Earth turns the rings precisely edge-on, making it seem like the thin bands are gone.",
      "\u201cThey literally almost disappear,\u201d said Sean Walker, an associate editor at Sky & Telescope, a monthly magazine about science and amateur astronomy. \u201cNormally you see the rings around Saturn, but when you have an edge-on view, it looks like a hair-thin line of light just cutting across.\u201d",
      "In recent months, Saturn\u2019s vast rings have appeared to progressively thin when viewed through ground-based telescopes. By Sunday, the rings will reach that precise edge-on angle.",
      "The illusion is temporary, lasting only about a day or two before the rings slowly start coming into view again.",
      "And the event is relatively rare: Ring plane crossings \u2014 as the phenomenon is known \u2014 typically occur twice during the 29.4 years it takes Saturn to make one orbit around the sun. This means they can be seen from Earth about once every 13 to 15 years.",
      "Unfortunately, however, Saturn will be too close to the sun this weekend for skywatchers to see how it looks without its rings. But another opportunity will come later this year, on Nov. 23, when the rings will be nearly edge-on (though not precisely).",
      "Walker said he witnessed a ring plane crossing in 1995, using a backyard telescope.",
      "\u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looked like a different planet. I spent a good part of the night just drinking in that view.\u201d",
      "It was around that time, he said, when he was just starting to become interested in astronomy.",
      "In addition to being a quirky product of geometry, a ring plane crossing also happens because of the structure of Saturn\u2019s rings. The iconic accessories are made up of billions of swirling chunks of rock and ice but are relatively flat, which is why the rings can seem to disappear into a thin line when tilted edge-on to Earth.",
      "The edge-on view also makes it easier to see more of Saturn\u2019s moons, Walker said.",
      "\u201cWhen we have these ring plane crossings, the light that normally reflects off Saturn\u2019s rings is no longer glaring back toward Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you can detect a lot more of the smaller moons.\u201d",
      "With a regular backyard telescope, Walker said, people can often spot four to six moons around Saturn. During a ring plane crossing in the dark sky, people may be able to detect nearly a dozen.",
      "\u201cThe really faint ones become apparent because they line up in almost a perfect line,\u201d he said.",
      "After this weekend\u2019s ring plane crossing, the next full one will take place in 2038. That event should be visible from Earth, according to Walker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see it again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a little while to wait.\u201d"

Then, last year, bad weather wiped out much of her crop.\u00a0But the return of Trump, she thought, would help reverse things.",
      "\u201cI was expecting to see a drastic turnaround for the better for my farm because the Republicans have always been for the American farmer,\u201d said Carlson, a longtime Republican and Trump supporter.",
      "Prices for cherries, her main crop, had increased during Trump's first term after his policies cut down on competition from overseas, and she was hoping to see a similar economic boost this time around. Instead, her farm has been caught up in the widespread government funding freezes, jeopardizing her ability to hire the workers she needs for this season's harvest. It could leave her $200,000 in debt if she's unable to access the grant money that had been awarded to her farm.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll admit to you, I bleed Republican. However, this has left a sour taste in my mouth,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cDuring Trump\u2019s first administration, a lot of farmers \u2014 not all, but a lot of farmers \u2014 saw the positive side to his tariffs and to his agricultural dealings.\"",

      "Voters in rural and agriculture-reliant areas have been one of Trump\u2019s most consistent bases of support since he first emerged on the political scene a decade ago. But the early days of his second administration have introduced a lot of risk to this sector of the economy. Trump's proposed tariffs could drive up the price of grain and fertilizers while lowering demand overseas for U.S. agriculture products. Immigration crackdowns could cripple farm workforces, where an estimated 40% of workers lack the proper documentation to work in the U.S. Meanwhile, spending cuts and freezes have directly affected federally funded programs that provide loans and grants to farmers.",
      "Trump has acknowledged his support from farmers and talked about how his policies would benefit them by reducing imports of food from abroad, which could increase demand for some U.S.-grown products.",
      "\u201cOur new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer \u2014 I love the farmer,\u201d Trump said during his address to Congress this month.",

The president added that farmers will \u201cprobably have to bear with me again\u201d as they did during his first term, when the tariffs he put in place on China resulted in retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. agriculture products, causing U.S. exports to China to tumble.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on Friday that the department was looking into program to help \"mitigate any economic catastrophes that could happen to some of our farmers.\" Asked whether that would include direct payments, Rollins said, \"We're working that out right now.\"",
      "While the situation with tariffs moves forward, Carlson says she doesn\u2019t have much time to wait to solve her problems.\u00a0Her farm had been awarded a grant worth $400,000 through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help pay for the costs associated with hiring seasonal workers from overseas through the H-2A visa program, which farmers have used for years to hire temporary agricultural workers.",
      "The USDA describes the program on its website as a way to address labor shortages on American farms and reduce illegal immigration. It's backed by $65 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan, a Covid stimulus bill passed in 2021.",
      "But now, funding for that program appears to be frozen. Farmers like Carlson have been unable to get reimbursed for expenses they\u2019ve already incurred under the grant, and there has been no official guidance from the USDA on whether they will get reimbursed for future expenses, said Michael Marsh, head of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, a trade group that works with the many farmers using the H-2A visa program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like have the rug pulled out from underneath you,\u201d Marsh said.",
      "That\u2019s left farmers having to borrow money while they wait to be  reimbursed for expenses they've already paid for under the grant. And it means they are uncertain on whether to move forward with taking on the additional cost of hiring workers from overseas, Marsh said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting right in the middle of the busy season where we\u2019re either planting crops or pruning vines and trees, where we really need the workers here,\u201d said Marsh. \u201cBut now, you\u2019re out the money that you\u2019ve been planning on being there for you.\u201d",
      "The Department of Agriculture didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the status of the funding.",
      "Farmers aren\u2019t alone in feeling the effects of sweeping cuts and funding freezes across the government, many of which are at the center of court fights. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued executive orders pausing some funds from former President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act along with funding for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Trump has also been cutting grants to research institutions and dismantling whole agencies, like USAID, and many of the contracts and grants that come from those agencies.",
      "Carlson was planning to use her USDA grant money to hire 10 temporary workers from Guatemala to help with this year\u2019s harvest. The grant would help pay to house the required workers on her property and the visa fees and airfare to fly the workers to and from the U.S.",
      "The added workers on her farm would have been a game changer, she said. Since taking over the family farm in 2019, most of the labor has been done by her, her husband, two year-round employees and a few local seasonal workers. With the added help, she could run multiple shifts a day picking cherries to get as much of her crop harvested as possible before it starts to spoil. It also would give her more time with her four children, including her 3-year-old twins.",
      "The program to bring over the foreign workers hasn\u2019t been cheap or easy, but she saw it as the only way to boost her workforce.",
      "\u201cThe American worker doesn\u2019t like labor, they don\u2019t like to do laborious jobs,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do the hard labor, and that\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating, because we would love to hire U.S. workers, but we can\u2019t get them to show up. We can\u2019t get them to follow through. We can\u2019t get them to finish the season.\u201d",
      "Carlson has been trying to get an answer from the USDA about the status of her grant, but her grant manager told her that they were \u201cawaiting guidance from leadership.\u201d When she followed up more recently, she received an out-of-office email.",
      "\u201cWe have had no direction from our grant project managers,\" she said. \"We\u2019ve asked them, are we supposed to continue meeting our milestones and continue meeting our goals? Or do we stop and wait? All we get back with a response is an automated message.\u201d",
      "To prepare for the workers arrival, including renovating housing on her property to bring it up to code, Carlson has already spent $200,000 of her own money that she was expecting to get reimbursed under her grant\u2019s contract. Without that money in her bank account, she doesn\u2019t expect to have the funds to pay her existing staff to get through the growing season.",
      "Carlson also doesn\u2019t have much time left to make a decision about whether to spend even more to bring workers over. By April 5, she is supposed to have purchased the airfare for the workers she was planning to hire, who were supposed to arrive in May.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at that point where if we don\u2019t get this funding, there could be issues of bankruptcy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American farmer is failing right now because you\u2019re freezing funding meant to help the American farmer.\u201d"

      "Parton met Dean at a laundromat when she was 18 years old, marrying in 1966 and becoming inseparable until he died March 3 at the age of 82. Dean rarely made public appearances with Parton, opting to stay out of the spotlight during their nearly 60 years of marriage.",

      "Difficult to watch, but impossible to look away from, \"Adolescence\" has been racking up acclaim since its premiere on Netflix on March 13.",
      "The final episode of the series hinges on a British slang term that American viewers may not be familiar with \u2014 but is important for understanding the plot.",
      "To rewind, the four-episode miniseries begins with the arrest of 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) for the murder of a fellow classmate, Katie Leonard. Each episode is filmed in one shot, taking place over a single hour in the 13 months after his arrest.",
      "In the last episode, Jamie's parents and sister try to adjust to their new normal. Jamie's father, Eddie Miller (played by series creator Stephen Graham), wakes up in a good mood \u2014 it's his birthday and he seems determined to celebrate.",
      "Yet his happiness is brief, as the cloud of what Jamie did still looms over the family. Lisa Miller (Amelie Pease), Jamie's sister, discovers that the word \"nonse\" has been spray painted on the side of Eddie's van. It's worth noting the word is misspelled, which means a younger person could have vandalized the car.",
      "In its simplest definition, this a British slang term that means \"pedophile.\" The Cambridge Dictionary, spelling it \"nonce,\" defines it as \"a person who commits a crime involving sex, especially sex with a child.\"",
      "Yorkshire native Emmeline Armitage, 25, tells TODAY.com that the power of the word \u201cnonse\u201d has fluctuated.",
      "She says that it\u2019s a word \u201cthat\u2019s sort of associated with certain types of British humor,\u201d like \u201cTV shows from like 10-15 years ago.\u201d",
      "Armitage notes \u201cThe Inbetweeners\u201d \u2014 a British sitcom about teenage boys that ran from 2008 to 2010 \u2014 as an example of a show where the word \u201cwould get thrown around.\u201d",
      "It \u201cdefinitely carried less weight at a certain time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m wondering if it carries a bit more weight to it now that we are in a culture where people are more aware of the things that they\u2019re saying.\u201d",
      "The implication is that people in the Millers' community blame Eddie, and possibly the conditions of Jamie's household, for what he did.",
      "Jamie's guilt is never in question: In the first episode, police find a video of him repeatedly stabbing Katie.",
      "The question, then, becomes why Jamie killed Katie. Creator Graham told Rolling Stone that he knows he is \u201cnot alone in blaming the parents sometimes\u201d when he sees these events like the one in \"Adolescence\" on the news.",
      "But with \u201cAdolescence,\u201d Graham wanted to create a narrative where the parents weren\u2019t at fault.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018What if it\u2019s not the parents?\u2019\u201d he told Rolling Stone. \u201cI wanted the dad to be a hardworking man, the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, 6 in the morning and not get home till 8 o\u2019clock at night, Monday to Friday.\u201d",
      "Police uncover that Jamie had been radicalized by incel propaganda online. \"Incel\" is a term that stands for \"involuntary celibate\" and is defined as a group of \u201cheterosexual men who blame women and society for their lack of romantic success\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "In Episode 3, during a charged conversation with a therapist, Jamie lets on that he thought he was too ugly to ever receive a woman's affection. When Katie rejected him, then bullied him in an Instagram comment, he got an awful revenge.",
      "Even if his home environment didn't lead Jamie to become a murderer, that doesn't mean the public sees it that way \u2014 which explains the vandalism of the Millers' van.",
      "The Millers, in the finale, confront their own responsibility in what Jamie became. How could they have \u201cmade\u201d a Jamie, they wonder? But they reason that they also \"made\" a Lisa, who is well-adjusted.",
      "The show gives no easy answers about Jamie, and no answers about what's next for the Millers. One year after his arrest, the entire family is paying the price. For now, Eddie will focus on removing the graffiti from his car \u2014 but one could imagine a world where the Millers leave and start over entirely."

      "Here's a rundown of the ending of \"Adolescence\" and why it leaves no room for easy answers.",
      "Did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Yes, and this gets cleared up fairly early in the series: In Episode 1, CCTV footage shows Jamie and Katie in an altercation. She pushes him, and he pushes her, and then he stabs her repeatedly.",
      "It\u2019s all shown at a distance, without volume, and unless you knew he had a knife on him it might seem that Jamie was punching her.",
      "Jamie\u2019s father Eddie (series co-creator and co-writer Stephen Graham) is shown the footage in that first episode, and believes it \u2014 despite Jamie insisting he wasn\u2019t the one who killed the girl.",
      "Why did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Since we know Jamie is guilty early on, what remains to be discovered in the last three episodes is the \u201cwhy,\u201d and that\u2019s where things get complicated.",
      "Police bumble their way through coded teen internet speak, discovering that adolescents are aware of phrases like \u201cmanosphere\u201d and \u201cincel.\u201d",
      "\"Incel\" stands for \"involuntary celibate\" and is defined as a group of \u201cheterosexual men who blame women and society for their lack of romantic success\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "They also learn quickly that bullying can happen from multiple angles \u2014 both online in the real world \u2014 that teenagers\u2019 need to be seen and valued by their peers can triumph over everything else they might learn at home or from teachers.",
      "In Episode 3, when we dive deeper into Jamie\u2019s thinking, the series doesn\u2019t let us see a cut-and-dried version of him as either villain or misunderstood victim of bullies. He has a temper, and seems to get pleasure when others are afraid of him. But he can be polite and genuine, unsure exactly of what is going on around him. It\u2019s in this episode where his insistence that he didn\u2019t kill Kate might make some sense in his mind \u2014 he doesn\u2019t see himself as the bad guy, or someone who is capable of killing. But his anger showed him differently.",
      "It appears Jamie killed Katie after being influenced by corners of the internet that convinced him he was too \"ugly\" to receive affection from a woman, as he lets out in his conversation with the therapist in Episode 3.",
      "When Katie turned down his advances and bullied him with an emoji that implied he was an incel, he did something tragic.",
      "What happens to Jamie at the end of \u2018Adolescence\u2019?",
      "Jamie isn\u2019t seen in the last episode, only briefly heard. The final episode looks at an earth-shaking morning in the life of Jamie\u2019s family, with Eddie, his mother Manda (Christine Tremarco) and sister Lisa (Amelie Pease).",
      "While they\u2019re riding in Eddie\u2019s recently-vandalized van, they get a call from Jamie \u2014 who announces he\u2019s changing his plea to \u201cguilty\u201d when he goes to court. He doesn\u2019t give a reason why.",
      "Back home, Eddie and Manda have a mutual breakdown, wondering where they went wrong. They ask if they should have gotten him a computer, and put few restrictions on his using it. Eddie, who was physically abused as a boy, says he only wanted to do better with his children. How could they have \u201cmade\u201d a Jamie? But then they also realize they \u201cmade\u201d a Lisa, who by all lights is doing well in school and acts sensibly.",
      "The final scene features Eddy weeping in his son\u2019s bed, surrounded by Jamie\u2019s belongings and toy teddy bear. He gives the bear a small kiss, and tucks it into bed \u2014 something he probably won\u2019t be able to do with his own son ever again.",
      "Will there be an \u2018Adolescence\u2019 Season 2?",
      "It seems unlikely; the Millers\u2019 story in the miniseries comes to a conclusion of sorts, even if it doesn\u2019t provide pat answers. In theory, \u201cAdolescence\u201d could become an anthology series, with different crimes and different characters, but as of now there\u2019s been no announcement from Netflix that there are plans to replicate the show."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for Netflix's \"The Residence.\"",
      "\"The Residence,\" which debuted on Netflix March 20, may be a Shondaland production, but it feels more like an Agatha Christie novel come to life.",
      "The first episode of \"The Residence\" sets up the main plot for the limited series, beginning with the death of A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito), the chief usher at the White House, during a state dinner with Australia.",
      "The show then cuts back and forth between a congressional committee hearing and the events of the night that led to A.B.'s death, including the subsequent investigation led by Detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba).",
      "After observing the crime scene, Detective Cupp \u2014 a world-class detective and avid bird watcher who can be described as a mix between Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot \u2014 declares that A.B. did not die by suicide (as it was speculated) but was murdered, launching a lengthy investigation.",
      "Throughout the investigation multiple suspects \u2014 though Detective Cupp refrains from ever calling anyone a suspect \u2014 are identified.",
      "Those identified as potential persons of interest include: White House butler Sheila Cannon (Edwina Findley), first gentleman Elliot Morgan (Barrett Foa), Australian Foreign Minister David Rylance (Brett Tucker), executive pastry chef Didier Gotthard (Bronson Pinchot), White House chef Marvella (Mary Wiseman), President Morgan's social secretary Lilly Schumacher (Molly Griggs), President's brother Tripp Morgan (Jason Lee), maid Elsyie Chayle (Julieth Restrepo), White House engineer Bruce Geller (Mel Rodriguez), \u201cthird man\u201d\u00a0Patrick Doumbe (Timothy Hornor), the president\u2019s oldest friend Harry Hollinger (Ken Marino) and Jasmine Haney (Susan Kelechi Watson, the White House assistant usher who later becomes A.B.'s replacement.",
      "With the wide range of options, a major question looms: Who killed A.B. Wynter \u2014 and better yet, how?",
      "How does 'The Residence' end?",
      "The final episode begins with Detective Cupp contemplating those she deems as persons of interest as she imagines the night of A.B. Wynter's death and his interactions with staff.",
      "She gathers all her potential suspects, knowing the murderer is one of them, but not yet sure who did the deed.",
      "As she attempts to put together the events of the night that A.B. was killed, the detective notes that part of the confusion comes from the amount of people who moved A.B.'s dead body around the house.",
      "First, Bruce Geller moved him, thinking the love of his life Elsyie Chayle had killed him. Then, after a night of partying, Tripp Morgan woke up next to A.B.'s dead body and in a panic moved him while hiding evidence in the process. Tripp also found the apparent suicide note in A.B.'s pocket and slit his wrists with Didier Gotthard's knife for good measure.",
      "But Detective Cupp doesn't believe any of these people killed A.B. She admits they all could have, but there are too many loose ends. And, she's still searching for the murder weapon: a large, ornate clock that has been missing since A.B.'s death.",
      "After taking into account the narrow window of time that someone could possibly kill A.B., amid his many confrontations with staff and his dead body being moved around, Detective Cupp reveals that A.B. was killed in the Yellow Oval Room. Her theory is that the wall in the room has a hidden service corridor -- but has since been sealed in the months after A.B.'s death.",
      "Harry Hollinger reveals that Jasmine Haney ordered the door to be sealed. But Jasmine says she was given an order over the phone by first gentleman Elliott Morgan to seal it. However, Detective Cupp thinks it wasn't Morgan, but someone disguising their voice as him.",
      "Lilly Schumacher admits she ordered the door sealed, pretending to be Elliott Morgan. On the night of the murder, she says she got in a fight with A.B. and in the heat of it, she tore a page out of his diary but later came back to apologize. When she did, she heard a violent fight between him and Elsyie and then returned later to find him dead.",
      "Lilly then accuses Elysie and Bruce of killing A.B. together, saying that they told her they did it. She says she felt bad for them, as Elsyie has a daughter, and gave them the page she tore out of his diary since it looked like a suicide note. Through tears, she says that she sealed the door out of panic and to change the energy of the room.",
      "However, Detective Cupp doesn\u2019t believe her teary performance or her version of the story. Instead, she puts on gloves and grabs a knife from her bag, reopening the sealed door in the Yellow Oval Room. Inside the service passageway, she finds a hidden compartment with the bloody clock, which she brings back out and puts on the mantel.",
      "Detective Cupp explains that Lilly killed A.B. because she hates everyone in the room and the White House as an institution. She then reveals that the heated fight between Harry and A.B. was actually between Lilly and A.B. They fought because A.B. was going to expose her to the president for all the selfish and abusive things she\u2019d done since arriving at the White House which he had documented in his journal.",
      "But, it wasn\u2019t just Lilly's poor behavior he planned to expose. A.B. had found that she was stealing money from the White House, in addition to violating various criminal statutes and ethical codes to secure vendors and invites.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you tried to grab his journal,\u201d Detective Cupp tells Lilly. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why when you walked out of his office that night, and stood in the hallway, and read that page that you accidentally ripped out, you decided to kill him. To stage his suicide.\u201d",
      "Detective Cupp explains that Lilly called A.B. to ask him to come to the Yellow Oval Room so she could apologize. Then she called the Secret Service, pretending to be Elliott Morgan, and told them to stay off that floor. Meanwhile, she had gathered a drink dosed in poison from the garden shed and waited for Elysie to exit after her argument with A.B. so she could give him the drink. During her meeting with him, she gave him the page from his journal back, watching him place it in his pocket to later serve as a suicide note.",
      "Detective Cupp said that A.B. tasted the poison, but tossed the rest of it out onto the roses \u2014 burning them. So, Lilly threw a vase at him to finish the job, but missed. She then grabbed the largest object in the room \u2014 a heavy clock \u2014 and killed him with it. Afterward, she escaped into the service passageway, and put the bloody clock inside a hidden storage door within the passageway.",
      "\u201cIt was a brilliant plan and you deserve a lot of credit, but you really only made it as long as you did because of the bizarre miscommunications and regrettable behavior from so many other people in the house,\u201d Detective Cupp says.",
      "Lilly is arrested and Detective Cupp tells the Congressional Committee that she was suspicious of Lilly ever since she said that she had seen Elysie and A.B. arguing, since A.B. always kept his arguments behind closed doors. She also had heard Lilly's impression of Elliott Morgan and thought she was the one who had faked the multiple phone calls from him in an attempt to give orders.",
      "Lilly also blinked, which made Detective Cupp think her tears were fake. The final tip off (before the discovery of the bloody clock that had her fingerprints on it) was when Lilly said she saw Bruce put the note in A.B.'s jacket. Detective Cupp says Lilly was never in the room with them when Detective Cupp discovered the note, so how would Schumacher know it was in A.B.'s jacket pocket.",
      "After solving the his murder, Detective Cupp gives a moving speech honoring A.B.'s legacy and wishes for the White House, which based upon the staff's interactions, appears to be a very divided and chaotic place to work.",
      "\"He loved this house. I didn't know him, but I know that,\" she said. \"Loved the people who work here. Respected them. Understood them. Appreciated them. Saw them. Saw who they were, where they came from, what they had given up to be here, why they were here.\"",
      "She then references a theme brought up earlier in the show when Jasmine Haney explains that the White House is divided between \"us\" (the staff that report to the chief usher and count on him to defend them) and \"them\" (everybody else, from the president to the Secret Service).",
      "\"Why was he here?\" Detective Cupp continued. \"For you, Mr. President. And for you, Mr. Morgan. For everyone here. For all of us. It wasn't 'us versus them' for Wynter. It really wasn't. It was just us. One house. One family. One imperfect union. Trying to make it work. Enduring. He believed in that, in this. And look, I'm just the detective, but I think this is really worth believing in.\""

    "summary": "What happens in the Severance Season 2 finale? What is Cold Harbor? The finale explained plus the many questions it leaves for Season 3 to answer.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cSeverance\u201d fans have been waiting for the arrival of \u201cCold Harbor\u201d \u2014 the 10th and final episode of Season 2 \u2014 for weeks.",
      "While the second season of the twisty hit Apple TV+ show has deepened the mysteries of the corporation called Lumon and the \u201cinnies\u201d who work there, as well as their split-mind \u201couties\u201d who live in the real world, there have been far more questions than answers.",
      "Thursday night marked the premiere of \u201cCold Harbor,\u201d and while it gave quite a few answers to what Mark S. (Adam Scott) would do to free his not-actually-dead wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) from the experimental clutches of Lumon\u2019s lower floor, viewers are still left with a lot of questions \u2014 and a set-up for a tense Season 3.",
      "Here\u2019s what we found out as Season 2 wrapped up, what we think we know \u2026 and where we imagine things might go next. At least, that\u2019s what our outies think.",
      "Spoiler alerts for \u201cSeverance\u201d Season 2 \u2014 especially \u201cCold Harbor\u201d ahead.",
      "What happened in the \u2018Severance\u2019 Season 2 finale?",
      "The 75-minute season finale was packed with satisfying scenes from the start.",
      "Mark S., brought to a \u201cbirthing cabin\u201d owned by Lumon, was able to have a surreal conversation between his innie and outie selves for the first time, thanks to a video camera and an inside threshold that allowed him to flip back and forth between his severed and un-severed selves.",
      "Unfortunately, Mark\u2019s innie is as smart as his outie. He figured out pretty fast that even though Outie Mark was sincere in wanting to re-integrate their personalities and memories after getting Gemma out of Lumon, that would likely be the end of his \u201cinnie\u201d life \u2014 and meaningful love for innie Helly R. (Britt Lower). But Innie Mark wasn\u2019t entirely unsympathetic.",
      "Conflicted, Mark returned to Lumon to complete the \u201cCold Harbor\u201d file, and then used Irving\u2019s (John Turturro) notes to access the lower floor and find Gemma.",
      "But that didn\u2019t mean it was easy: He had to evade a marching band (\u201cSeverance\u201d wouldn\u2019t be complete without some truly surreal moments), take a beating from Mr. Drummond (\u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson). Goat-handler Lorne (Gwendoline Christie) saves Mark's life and frees him so he can track down Gemma. Also saved is Emile, the baby goat that Mr. Drummond was forcing Lorne to kill.",
      "In a deeply clever move, Mark even used his tie to access the room where Gemma had been told to disassemble a crib.",
      "Briefly, Mark and Gemma's Outie selves were reunited and shared a passionate kiss or two. But once they returned to the main floor, everything changed again as their innies took over. Innie Mark took Ms. Casey/Gemma to the exit door and helped her get outside (where she became Outie Gemma) \u2014 while he remained his Innie, inside. With Helly R. standing at one end of the corridor and Gemma now freed outside and pounding on the door for him to leave, what would Innie Mark do?",
      "At last, he made his choice to stay as Innie Mark \u2014 and ran off, bloodstained and unsure of the future, with Helly R. As they ran, the 1968 hit \u201cThe Windmills of Your Mind\u201d (originally introduced in that year\u2019s \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair\u201d) played.",
      "Is there \u201cno honeymoon\u201d for them, as Mrs. Cobel (Patricia Arquette) declared? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.",
      "What did we actually learn in \u2018Cold Harbor\u2019 and its mysterious motivations?",
      "\u201cCold Harbor\u201d was mostly full of plot and a few revelations, but here are a few things we discovered:",
      "Mrs. Cobel told Mark, \u201cThe numbers are your wife.\u201d The numbers refer to all the number sequences he\u2019s been combining into digital boxes at his work station every day. Apparently Mark has created 24 files; \u201cCold Harbor\u201d will be the 25th, and every file is a new innie consciousness of Gemma.\u00a0Lumon apparently has a marching band of Innies on call, as well as a \u201cChoreography and Merriment\u201d department.Dylan\u2019s (Zach Cherry) Outie also communicated with his Innie, who\u2019d tried to quit Lumon in a previous episode. But this was a more empathetic connection: Outie Dylan wrote Innie Dylan a note, which Mr. Milchick (Trammel Tillman) handed to him \u2014 and the note said that Outie Dylan aspired to be the kind of man Innie was. He gave Dylan the option to stay, or quit.\u00a0Dylan remained at Lumon, and was again critical in holding back the tide so that Mark could be the hero.",

      "If Mark has been intuitively creating the new innies of Gemma by filing numbers away based on how they make him feel \u2014 the \u201ctempers\u201d Keir Eagan and Lumon have based their philosophy/religion on \u2014 what have Helly, Irving and Dylan been doing with their files?

While living on her own, Grace met another set of adoptive parents, Cynthia and Antwon Mans \u2014 though now Grace lives with the DePaul family in New York.",
      "Inspired by Grace\u2019s story, \u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalized version of both her and the Barnetts\u2019 perspectives from her adoption, allegations against her, her abandonment and the family\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "\u201cOur show does a brilliant job of playing with multiple perspectives and creating our own versions of our characters,\u201d Reid says. \u201cAnd you really have to watch it all to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "But when it all comes down to it, it\u2019s Reid\u2019s performance that will captivate audiences \u2014 and already impressed her co-stars Christina Hendricks, who plays Cynthia Mans, and Mark Duplass, who plays Michael Barnett.",
      "Here's what to know about Reid and her time on the show.",
      "Casting Imogen Faith Reid as Natalia Grace",
      "Series creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins tells TODAY.com that making \u201cGood American Family\u201d happen was \u201ccontingent\u201d on casting the right actor for the role of Natalia Grace.",
      "\u201cIt was such a challenging part, and it lived and died on finding somebody who could play it,\u201d Robbins says, adding that Reid\u2019s audition tape \u201cblew everybody away.\u201d",
      "Born May 1, 1997, Reid had stand-in and body double parts in \u201cThe One and Only Ivan,\u201d \u201cThe Third Day,\u201d \u201cThe Rings of Power\u201d and \u201cThe Famous Five\u201d prior to \u201cGood American Family,\u201d according to her IMDB. She\u2019s also done some theater in the past.",
      "The newcomer tells TODAY.com she made a self-tape for her audition, but didn\u2019t think she would be cast because she believed the casting directors would \u201cpick an American actress.\u201d",
      "\u201cI went for it anyway because there was nothing to lose. And I think I had done about 400 takes of that self-tape, and my sister was helping me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "Weeks later, she got the role. \u201cIt was just such a surreal, interesting moment. And I\u2019ll never forget that experience,\" she says.",
      "Robbins adds that despite Reid\u2019s lack of on-screen experience, \u201cShe brought us all in with her emotional accessibility, her vulnerability, her ability to play multiple sides and shades of this character.\u201d",
      "She explains that the role of Natalia is \u201cso challenging\u201d because \u201cnot only does she have to play a range of years, but also different versions of the same character.\u201d",
      "Throughout \u201cGood American Family,\u201d Reid had to depict Natalia from the young girl\u2019s perspective, but also from the perspective of other characters in the show.",
      "\u201cAnd Imogen just had this capacity to hold all of that while still being incredibly vulnerable and accessible and warm,\u201d Robbins says, adding that as an actor, Reid made her want to lean in and watch.",
      "The challenges of portraying Natalia Grace",
      "Portraying Grace came with a set of challenges for Reid, but the actor knew that she was the perfect person for the role.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest thing is I\u2019m a little person, and as a little person, I understand the daily struggles that we go through and the judgment that we perceive in everyday life,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSo something like that, I knew I could relate to. And also the casting directors, I felt done an amazing job with casting someone like me, who can look young and who can also play older.\u201d",
      "To create her own version of Grace, Reid worked with a dialect coach who helped her go through every script and break down certain sounds and pronunciations.",
      "Duplass, who portrays Natalia\u2019s adoptive father Michael, was just as impressed with Reid\u2019s performance and dedication to her craft.",
      "Aside from this being Reid\u2019s first speaking part on camera \u2014 in an American accent, no less \u2014 Duplass also pointed out the physicality the role required.",
      "\u201cThen you add in that her form of dwarfism is different than Natalia\u2019s dwarfism, so she had to learn a specific physicality that could work inside of her body and feel true to her. She had to build that whole thing out,\u201d Duplass says, adding that Reid was also out of her comfort zone, living in Los Angeles and \u201cthrust right into the identifier of \u2018making TV.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd she was just incredible! I was kind of blown away by her every day,\u201d he says.",
      "Hendricks also worked closely with Reid while portraying Natalia\u2019s next adoptive mother Cynthia Mans. While talking to TODAY.com, Hendricks shared how Reid would constantly be working with a dialect coach as \u201cso professional,\u201d \u201cdedicated and yet so playful and easy.\u201d",
      "She adds that they had \u201cimmediate chemistry\u201d and quickly became friends.",
      "Separating her character from the real Natalia Grace",
      "Reid tells TODAY.com that she did not reach out to Grace ahead of the project.",
      "\u201cI wanted to play my own version. And something that was really important for me was to portray that light and empowerment,\u201d she says. \u201cJust wanting to fight for that justice and to be seen. Those were some key elements that I wanted to implement.\u201d",
      "Reid may be telling one specific timeline of Grace\u2019s life, but the true story continues to make headlines. Earlier this year, the third season of the documentary series \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace\" was released and included the latest on Grace\u2019s life.",
      "This January, Grace told People that she was currently living in New York with Nicole and Vincent DePaul in upstate New York.",
      "Reid hopes \"Good American Family\" teaches people to \u201cnot to judge too quickly and always be open to different people\u2019s opinions and perspectives.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all different, we\u2019re not the same, everybody\u2019s unique,\u201d Reid says. \u201cWe all have lived such different lives, and it\u2019s about just taking that grace for yourself and understanding (that) it's OK and everybody\u2019s different. That\u2019s what makes us, us.\u201d",
      "Big things ahead for Imogen Faith Reed",
      "Reid hopes \u201cGood American Family\u201d opens more doors for her.",
      "\u201cIt would be so amazing. I love this industry, and it\u2019s such an honor to be a part of it,\u201d she says. \u201cComing away from this, I\u2019ve really seen what I\u2019ve done ... I\u2019m proud of how hard I\u2019ve worked to get where I am.\u201d",
      "Duplass agrees, telling TODAY.com that having Reid on set was good for him and co-star Ellen Pompeo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like the crotchety veterans who\u2019ve been around a long time,\u201d he jokes. \u201cAnd she kind of brought us up a little bit ... I see big, big things for her.\u201d"

      "Jenny Slate is choosing to not further engage with \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d amid the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.",
      "In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Slate declined a question about the 2024 film. When asked how filming the new miniseries \u201cDying for Sex\u201d compared to \"It Ends With Us,\" Slate responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say about that.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cEverything is its own thing. I poured my heart into this work, and every minute of (\u2018Dying for Sex\u2019) was important to me, and I just want to talk about that.\u201d",
      "The actor and comedian, 42, starred in the controversial 2024 drama alongside Lively and Baldoni and promoted the film with the cast. After Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni in December accusing him of sexual harassment and participating in a smear campaign to damage her reputation, Slate spoke out to show support for the \u201cA Simple Favor\u201d actor.",
      "In December, Slate sent a statement exclusively to TODAY.com that said she stood by Lively, whom she referred to as a \u201cloyal friend\u201d and \u201ctrusted source of emotional support.\u201d",

      "Now, as Slate prepares for the release of her next project, \u201cDying for Sex,\u201d Slate is not providing an additional comment on the situation.",

      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Slate plays Allysa, Lively\u2019s character\u2019s best friend and the sister of Baldoni\u2019s character. As the cast promoted the Colleen Hoover adaptation prior to its Aug. 9, 2024, release, fans pointed out on social media that Lively posed for photos with Slate and co-star Brandon Sklenar at the movie\u2019s New York premiere, but she did not interact with Baldoni. The lack of pictures and interviews with Lively and Baldoni during the press run fueled rumors at the time that there was tension between them.",

      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his media company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel a few days later on Dec. 31.",
      "Attorneys for Lively said in a statement to NBC News, in part, \u201cMs. Lively previously sent her California Civil Rights Department Complaint in response to the retaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns. Unfortunately, Ms. Lively\u2019s decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks. As alleged in Ms. Lively\u2019s federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "That same day, Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel after the news outlet published an article about Lively's allegations in the California Civil Rights Department complaint.",
      "On Jan. 16, Baldoni filed a lawsuit against Lively, husband Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm, accusing the parties of defamation and other contractual claims. The 179-page complaint alleged that the \u201cGossip Girl\u201d alum took creative control over her character, refused to promote the film unless she could produce edits of the final cut and more accusations.",
      "As the legal back-and-forth continues, U.S. District Court Judge Lewis J. Liman set a trial date of March 9, 2026, to address both lawsuits, according to court documents obtained by NBC News."

      "This week Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.",
      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0roots in the Soviet era when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sport, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.\u00a0As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada. \u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him.\u201d",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201dThroughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cping pong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming in his book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games, and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism as to whether the games will actually ever play out.",

      "Israel had said Saturday that it would respond \u201cseverely\u201d to the attack from Lebanon early Saturday morning, when rockets were fired into northern Israel. Israel\u2019s army said the intercepted rockets targeted the Israeli town of Metula.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after\u00a0Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack\u00a0out of Gaza ignited the war there.\u00a0The Israel-Hezbollah conflict\u00a0boiled over into an all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group\u2019s senior leaders. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.",
      "Under the ceasefire reached in November, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was then extended to Feb. 18 by agreement between Lebanon and Israel.",
      "But since then, Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel, and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.",
      "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s office said Saturday it instructed the army to act forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, adding: \u201cIsrael will not allow any harm to its citizens and sovereignty.\u201d Israel\u2019s army said Saturday it was carrying out strikes on Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah.",
      "In a statement, Lebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south, but said the country did not want to return to war.",
      "The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, saying further escalation could have serious consequences for the region.",
      "Israeli airstrikes pound Gaza",
      "The strikes come a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza \u201cwith increasing intensity\u201d until Hamas frees the\u00a059 hostages it holds\u00a0\u2014 24 of whom are believed alive. Late Friday night, Israeli strikes killed at least nine people, including three children, in a house in Gaza City, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies.",
      "Israel\u2019s military said Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighborhoods west of Gaza City and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas.",
      "Also on Friday, Israel blew up the only specialized cancer hospital in the war-torn territory. The Israeli military said it struck the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, accusing Hamas militants of operating on-site. Turkey, which helped build and fund the hospital, said Israeli troops at one point used it as a base.",
      "Around 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war earlier this week. Israel had already cut off the supply of\u00a0food, fuel, and humanitarian aid\u00a0to Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over ceasefire negotiations.",
      "The international community has condemned the resumed attacks. In a statement Friday, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany called Israel\u2019s strikes in Gaza a dramatic step backward. \u201cWe are appalled by the civilian casualties and urgently call for an immediate return to a ceasefire,\u201d they said in a joint statement.",
      "The attack by Hamas-led militants in 2023 killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence."

      "Israel ordered its troops to permanently seize parts of the Gaza Strip \u2014 to be \u201cannexed to Israel\u201d \u2014 unless Hamas hands over the remaining hostages, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Friday.",
      "The statement came after Israel this week broke the two-month ceasefire with Hamas, with the resumption of airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza killing nearly 600 people.",
      "The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to intensify those operations until the militant group, which nominally controlled Gaza before this round of conflict, returns the 59 dead and living hostages who it continues to hold captive.",
      "\u201cI have instructed the IDF to seize additional areas in Gaza, while evacuating the population, and to expand the security zones around Gaza for the protection of Israeli communities and IDF soldiers,\u201d Katz said in a statement. \u201cThe more Hamas persists in its refusal to release the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel.\u201d",
      "Katz also threatened the use of \u201call military and civilian pressure tools including the evacuation of Gaza\u2019s population southward and the implementation of voluntary relocation plans for Gaza residents,\u201d while describing the new more expansive phase of Israel's military offensive in the enclave.",
      "He added that this would be done \"through permanent Israeli control of the territory.\"",
      "Hamas said Friday that it \"remains at the heart of the negotiations,\" and was engaging with mediators including \"discussing the Witkoff proposal and the various ideas on the table.\"",
      "The group said in a statement that its aim is \"achieving a prisoner exchange deal that secures the release of prisoners, ends the war, and achieves withdrawal.\"",
      "Since signing the ceasefire in January, Netanyahu has faced the twin pressures of hostage families urging him to facilitate their return, and his hard-right coalition members threatening to collapse his government unless he restarts the war. On Tuesday, his military opted for the latter, launching strikes into Gaza that he and the White House blamed on Hamas\u2019 refusal to release more hostages.",
      "But Netanyahu's accusations do not reflect the structure of the deal.",
      "In the first phase of the truce, Israel exchanged 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees for the return of 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight more of the roughly 250 who were taken captive during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed, according to Israel.",
      "Nearly 49,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave, according to local health officials, whose figures the World Health Organization has said in the past are reputable.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire ended March 1 and was meant to precede a second phase 16 days later involving the exchange of all remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire.",
      "That never happened, with Netanyahu agreeing to a proposal tabled by White House envoy Steven Witkoff to extend the ceasefire by 50 days in order to discuss phase two. This was immediately rejected by Hamas, but Katz said Friday that Israel was still standing by it.",
      "The White House has made it clear it stands with Israel\u2019s decision but has yet to respond to NBC News' request for comment on Katz's remarks Friday.",
      "\u201cThe president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday."

      "The Israeli military said it was again enforcing a blockade on\u00a0northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Palestinians were not being ordered to leave northern Gaza but can no longer enter, the military said, and are only allowed to move south on foot using the coastal road. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to\u00a0what remains of their homes\u00a0in the north during the ceasefire.",
      "Early Friday, Israel\u2019s Cabinet unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s request to fire the head of the country\u2019s Shin Bet internal security service. The late-night decision to sack Ronen Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.",

Both were intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace, according to the army, and no injuries were reported. Air raid sirens rang out and exploding interceptor rockets were heard in Jerusalem.

      "Israel\u2019s military said Thursday its airstrikes in Gaza had killed the head of Hamas\u2019 internal security apparatus and two other militant commanders. Israel has said it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. A United Nations-backed group of\u00a0human rights experts\u00a0accused Israel last week of \u201cdisproportionate violence against women and children\u201d during the war in Gaza.",
      "One of the strikes early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family\u2019s home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village outside Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was in an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.",

      "Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested and detained because of his pro-Palestinian activism, is scheduled to return to court next month in his battle with the Department of Justice over his possible deportation.",
      "His case has become a test of the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to combat antisemitism and deport noncitizen college activists who the Department of Homeland Security said \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York ruled Wednesday that Khalil\u2019s legal challenge to his detention should proceed in federal court in New Jersey, where he was briefly held when his attorneys filed a petition alleging his arrest and detention violated his right to due process and his First Amendment right to free speech.",
      "Furman said his order blocking the government from deporting Khalil will remain in effect as the case proceeds.",
      "Khalil, 30, who holds a green card granting him permanent residency in the U.S., is being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center,\u00a0more than 1,000 miles from his home in New York City. His legal team is trying to get him released.",
      "Khalil has a separate deportation case in Louisiana, where he appeared for a brief court hearing Friday as his lawyers challenged his arrest and detention, arguing the government\u2019s decision to send him away to the remote facility in Jena, Louisiana, impeded their ability to represent him.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to fight just as hard for Mr. Khalil in the district of New Jersey,\u201d said Amy Greer, a lawyer for Khalil. \u201cHe was taken by plainclothes federal agents, transferred in the middle of the night across state lines, and has been detained for over a week now, all because of his advocacy for Palestinian freedom.\u201d",
      "His lawyers have also said that Khalil should be released because he and his wife, Noor Abdalla, a U.S. citizen, are awaiting the birth of their first child next month. Khalil is an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent.",
      "The Trump administration said Khalil was moved to Louisiana because detention centers in the Northeast are overcrowded and there was a bedbug infestation at the New Jersey detention center where he was held after he was arrested March 8 outside his apartment.",
      "Khalil said in a court declaration on Monday that when he was at the detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, for a night, he \u201cdid not hear anyone mention bedbugs.\u201d He also said it appeared that other people processed at the site around the same time as he was were allowed to remain in New Jersey.The Trump administration argues that Khalil should be deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows noncitizens to be deported if the secretary of state determines their presence in the United States could adversely affect foreign policy.",
      "Khalil is not facing any publicly known criminal charges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost unprecedented to invoke a provision like this,\u201d said Marc Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout, one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThe government is clearly going after him because they don\u2019t like what he says about what\u2019s going on in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "At Friday\u2019s hearing in immigration court in Louisiana, Khalil\u2019s legal team was allowed more time to review the case before both parties return on April 8. Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout attended the hearing via video conference.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Khalil \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on March 11 that Khalil organized protests that disrupted the campus, harassed Jewish students and distributed pro-Hamas propaganda.",
      "Samah Sisay, another lawyer for Khalil, denied the Trump administration\u2019s claims, saying there is no evidence he provided support of any kind to a terrorist organization.",
      "Sisay told NBC News on Monday that regardless of where the case challenging his arrest will play out, \u201cour ultimate goal is to get our client out\u201d and to continue fighting for Khalil\u2019s release.",
      "\u201cEvery day that Khalil is in detention is justice denied,\u201d Sisay said. \u201cHe should not continue to be punished for the government\u2019s unlawful action. He can be released while fighting this.\u201d",
      "Sisay said Khalil\u2019s continued incarceration could also have major health risks for his wife\u2019s pregnancy with the \u201cimmense stress that\u2019s being put on her.\u201d"

      "Two men have been convicted of murder-for-hire as part of an Iranian government plot to silence a critic in the United States, federal prosecutors said Friday.",
      "Their target was journalist Masih Alinejad, a statement from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said. Alinejad has been critical of Iran\u2019s treatment of women and of its record on human rights.",
      "Rafat Amirov, 46; and Polad Omarov, 40, were convicted by a federal grand jury in New York City of five counts on Thursday, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement.",
      "The indictment includes charges of murder-for-hire; conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire; conspiracy to commit money laundering; attempted murder in aid of racketeering; and carrying a gun for an attempted murder, the office said.",
      "Alinejad responded to Thursday's verdict in a statement: \"For the first time, the regime of the Islamic Republic is being held accountable for bringing its campaign of terror to U.S. soil.\"",
      "She added, \"They failed. I am still here.\"",
      "Attorneys for Amirov did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Omarov's lawyer, Elena Fast, said by email, \"We respect the jury\u2019s verdict, but plan on filing an appeal on Mr. Omarov\u2019s behalf.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors said high-ranking members of the Revolutionary Guard tapped the pair, described in the indictment as superiors in New York City's Russian Mob, to find and kill Alinejad for $500,000.",
      "The assignment, prosecutors said, came a year after a failed attempt on behalf of the government of Iran to kidnap the journalist in 2021. The defendants subcontracted the latest assignment to another member of their crime group, Khalid Mehdiyev, who lived about 25 miles north of New York City, in Yonkers, prosecutors said.",
      "Iran has denied the 2021 allegation, calling it \u201cbaseless.\u201d",
      "Mehdiyev, identified in the indictment as \"a co-conspirator not named as a defendant herein,\" testified that he was hired by the defendants to kill Alinejad and earlier pleaded guilty to lesser counts as he cooperated with the prosecution.",
      "The pair sent him $30,000, according to the indictment. Mehdviyev purchased a Norinco AK-47 replica for the job, it said.",
      "On July 28, 2022, after Mehdviyev told his superiors he was ready to pull the trigger, he was arrested in a traffic stop near Alinejad\u2019s Brooklyn home, where police said they found the gun, the indictment said. Also found: 66 rounds of ammunition and $1,100 in cash, both in suitcase in the vehicle, it said.",
      "Mehdviyev was under FBI surveillance, according to a 2022 affidavit in support of arresting and charging him for allegedly possessing a firearm without a serial number, a federal crime.",
      "According to the affidavit, agents watched Mehdviyev go up to Alinejad's porch the day before his arrest. In a social media post, Alinejad shared security video showing a man on her porch who she said \"attempted to open the front door.\"",
      "\u201cThe defendants participated in a brazen plot to kill an Iranian American dissident in New York who criticized the regime in Iran,\u201d FBI counterintelligence acting director Roman Rozhavsky said in Friday's statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office. \u201cThe FBI will not tolerate Iran\u2019s attempts to threaten, silence, or harm American citizens.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday welcomed the convictions, writing on X: \"Yesterday\u2019s court decision shows Iran\u2019s attempts at lethal plotting against Americans like\u00a0@AlinejadMasih will be met with swift justice & accountability.\"",
      "Alinejad came to the U.S. after she was banished from Iran in the wake of her coverage of corrupt politicians and the disputed outcome of its 2009 national election.",
      "After she arrived, she launched a social media campaign encouraging women in the country to post photos of themselves in public sans their government-required hijabs. She was affiliated with Voice of America, a U.S.-government funded news outlet.",
      "Amirov and Omarov face the possibility of life in prison at sentencing, which is scheduled for Sept. 27, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.",
      "Last week, President Donald Trump ordered Voice of America to cut operations to the bare minimum under law."

      "Columbia University has agreed to a list of demands by the Trump administration in order to start negotiations on restoring $400 million in federal funding that was stripped from the university earlier this month, representing a striking concession by the private university to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0canceled the university\u2019s federal grants on March 7, accusing the New York school of \"inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" The abrupt cancellation of funds will end dozens, if not hundreds, of the university\u2019s cutting-edge medical and scientific research projects.",
      "But last week, the administration sent a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the university laying out nine demands that Columbia needed to accept to potentially restore funds and save the research.",
      "In a document the university provided to the federal government and published online Friday, it appears the Trump administration got much of what it asked for.",
      "The university has agreed to ban students from wearing masks at protests, hire 36 new campus security officers \u2014 who, unlike previous security officers, will have the ability to arrest students \u2014 and appoint a new senior vice provost\u00a0to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies.",
      "Columbia also committed to \u201cgreater institutional neutrality\u201d and said it is \u201cworking with a faculty committee to establish an institution-wide policy implementing this stance.\u201d The university added that it will review its admissions procedures to \u201censure unbiased admission processes,\u201d as the Trump administration requested.",
      "Columbia's interim president, Katrina Armstrong, said Friday that the school responded to the Trump administration to \"ensure uninterrupted academic activities.\"",
      "\u201cWe have much to be proud of as a community, and it has been a privilege to share our progress and plans,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn the spirit of great American universities, we expect Columbians to engage in robust debate and discussion about our way forward, and we welcome it as an opportunity to shape the future of Columbia.\u201d",
      "The concessions by one of the nation\u2019s oldest and most prestigious universities represent an unprecedented shift in how the federal government exerts leverage in the affairs of higher education institutions in the U.S.",
      "On Thursday, a student-led group that organizes and leads school protests, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, slammed the notion of Columbia striking a deal with the Trump administration.",
      "\"Columbia\u2019s refusal to divest from, and even doubling down on, the genocide of the Palestinian people these past 17 months has made its expected response to the Trump Administration\u2019s ransom note incredibly clear,\" the group wrote on Instagram.  \"Columbia has no intention of defending its students or faculty from the government\u2019s crackdown on Palestinian activism, instead it actively joins hands with the fascist state to sell out its community.\"",
      "On Thursday, 41 of the roughly 100 members of the university's history department warned the university against allowing the administration to interfere in its policy. They compared the  administration's actions to attempts by \"authoritarian regimes\" to seek control over independent academic institutions.",
      "\"Such interventions jeopardize our ability to think honestly about the past, the present, and the future, and to do so with our students, who deserve every opportunity to learn and to think for themselves,\" the history department members wrote. \"Should this control be realized, here or elsewhere, it would make any real historical scholarship, teaching, and intellectual community impossible.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's demands are the latest hit for the Ivy League school, seen as the epicenter of student-led pro-Palestinian demonstrations that eventually overtook life at college campuses across the nation.",
      "The protests were prompted by the Israeli government's fierce response to the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks. Israel's military has killed nearly 50,000 people living in Gaza and displaced millions. Student activists staged the demonstrations in an attempt to get their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government.",
      "For weeks last spring, Columbia students staged daily protests,\u00a0established an encampment of several dozen tents on university lawns and at one point occupied a university building. Dozens of students were arrested in demonstrations that regularly featured controversial political slogans, including \"from the river to the sea,\" which some have criticized as antisemitic.",
      "Some Jewish students joined the protesters on college campuses, while others said they felt like the demonstrations were hateful. Several Jewish students also reported being assaulted at other universities.",
      "Allie Wong, a Ph.D. student who was arrested while protesting on campus in April of last year, said that while the protests were divisive, she believes the challenges facing Columbia unite students around a common cause.",
      "\"In terms of student response, I think that you\u2019re actually going to have many more students involved in this, because it is no longer, you know, divestment, Israel, Palestine. It\u2019s about all these other things,\" she said, referring to democracy and freedom of speech. \"And I would argue there is no group on campus that these issues do not reach.\"",
      "The threats to federal funding followed the Justice Department's launch in February of a task force to \"root out\" what it calls\u00a0\"anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.\"",
      "Amid the negotiations over the grants, federal immigration officials apprehended at least two Columbia students who participated in the student-led protest, including 30-year-old\u00a0Mahmoud Khalil. A doctoral student from India, Ranjani Srinivasan, also fled to Canada after her student visa was revoked.",
      "Mohammad Hemeida, who chairs Columbia's student governing board, said he hopes that by allowing the Trump administration to declare a victory, immigration officials will lay off students.",
      "\"The look of Columbia bowing down is not good,\" he said. \"But what I'm worried about mostly is students being targeted, and I feel like they've used that as a tactic to pressure the institution.\"",
      "The arrests prompted new protests on campus and raised concerns nationwide about the federal government's infringement on free speech.",
      "The university\u2019s journalism school described the apprehensions as \"witnessing and experiencing an alarming chill.\"",
      "\"One does not have to agree with the political opinions of any particular individual to understand that these threats cut to the core of what it means to live in a pluralistic democracy,\" the journalism school said in a statement last week. \"The use of deportation to suppress foreign critics runs parallel to an aggressive campaign to use libel laws in novel \u2014 even outlandish ways \u2014 to silence or intimidate the independent press.\"",
      "Columbia students are on their spring break and will return to campus next week."

      "A rare joint effort launched by the Biden administration and embraced by the Trump White House brought two Palestinian children with cancer from Gaza to the U.S. for treatment this week, multiple sources tell NBC News.",
      "They are among 240 Palestinian children with cancer who have been evacuated from Gaza since the war began so they can get chemotherapy, blood transfusions and other treatments impossible to obtain in the war zone.",
      "But the resumption of fighting threatens to slow these evacuations,  with at least six more children diagnosed with cancer waiting to be extricated from Gaza for desperately needed treatment.",
      "On Wednesday, two Palestinian girls with cancer, 17-year-old Nesma and 12-year-old Leen, who asked that their last names not be disclosed for privacy reasons, finally made it to the U.S. treatment. But at least six other Palestinian children with cancer remain trapped in Gaza as fighting intensifies.",
      "In a rare example of cooperation between members of the Biden and Trump administrations, officials from both have pushed their counterparts in Israel, Egypt, Jordan\u00a0and other countries\u00a0to help get the children and their parents\u00a0or guardians security clearances\u00a0so they can be evacuated for life-saving treatment.",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, at least 12 young Palestinian cancer patients who had been approved to leave have died while waiting because of delays and red tape.",
      "The process, which has played out in fits and starts, has been both fraught and frustrating, according to former Biden White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients.",
      "\u201cWe pushed and pushed and pushed and thought we were making progress, and then would be blocked,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Modeled after an operation by the Biden administration, U.S. officials and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital\u00a0that evacuated 1,700 pediatric cancer patients from Ukraine, the Gaza effort proved far more complicated.",
      "While the war in Ukraine has a clear front line, Israel\u2019s unpredictable urban fighting with Hamas in Gaza complicated the rescue effort. For security\u00a0and health reasons, many of the evacuations took place one patient at a time in ambulances forced to navigate bombed out roads.",
      "The effort reached a low point in the spring of 2024. On May 6, 4-year-old cancer patient Nabil Kiheil was cleared to leave the next day by Israeli officials. But Israel\u2019s forces invaded the Rafah area and closed the border overnight, and Nabil\u00a0and his mother had to evacuate to a safer zone in the north.",
      "Forced to wait nearly a month for a crossing from Gaza to Israel to open, Nabil was later evacuated through the Kerem Shalom\u00a0crossing through Israel\u00a0to a hospital in East Jerusalem.",
      "Doctors there found that Nabil\u2019s condition had deteriorated, that he had developed sepsis and his organs had begun to fail. Nabil died in East Jerusalem of cardiac arrest less than a week after his fifth birthday.",
      "Nabil\u2019s death motivated Biden administration officials and doctors from St. Jude to push harder for evacuations, people involved in the operation said.\u00a0From June to November 2024, 46 Palestinian children with cancer got out of Gaza and received treatment in Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Italy and Spain.",
      "But in December 2024 and January 2025, 20 children were then denied visas to leave after Israeli officials began questioning whether caregivers of the sick children had ties to Hamas.",
      "September was the worst month in Gaza for relief efforts in all of 2024, with humanitarian assistance levels dropping to less than half of those in the spring. By October, the humanitarian situation in Gaza had grown so dire that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent a letter to their Israeli counterparts demanding that the Israeli government take steps to reverse the trajectory on the ground within 30 days to avoid restrictions on U.S. military aid to Israel, required under U.S. law.",
      "For several months, ceasefire talks were frozen as Biden administration officials repeated the same talking points, of \u201cwe\u2019re close,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re getting closer,\u201d while acknowledging that the most difficult sticking points were often left for the end.",
      "After Trump won the election in November, incoming Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. got involved. Over dinner at Mar-a-Lago, he appealed to the president-elect to help the pediatric cancer patients. Trump assigned the task to his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so worthy,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in an interview Thursday. \u201cNo matter what side of the battle lines you\u2019re on here, these are young kids and they needed to get proper care.\u201d",
      "The arrival of Nesma and Leen, the first pediatric cancer patients from Gaza to arrive in the U.S. for treatment, raised hopes of further evacuations. The two teens landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on Thursday on a humanitarian flight organized by St. Jude and paid for by Pfizer, whose CEO Albert Bourla has provided charter passage for cancer patients.",
      "Asked by NBC News if she\u2019s relieved her daughter made it to the U.S., Nesma\u2019s mother, Mirvat, said before leaving Dulles, \u201cI\u2019m happy for her.\u201d",

      "The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.",
      "The email pleaded for help.",

      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa\u2019s remote research bases\u00a0on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague\u2019s room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa\u2019s Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees\u00a0the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d\u00a0experienced harassment or assault\u00a0while on research trips in Antarctica."

    "summary": "Turkey\u2019s government warned against \u201cillegal\u201d calls from the main opposition for street protests over the detention of Istanbul\u2019s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.",
    "story": [
      "Turkey\u2019s government warned on Friday against \u201cillegal\u201d calls from the main opposition for street protests over the detention of Istanbul\u2019s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, after thousands demonstrated across the country in the last two days.",
      "Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 53 people were detained and 16 police officers were injured in protests that began at university campuses, Istanbul municipal headquarters and elsewhere on Thursday, triggering scattered clashes.",
      "Imamoglu, who is President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s main political rival and leads him in some polls, was detained on Wednesday facing charges including graft and aiding a terrorist group.",
      "The mayor\u2019s main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) has condemned the move as politically-motivated and urged people to lawfully demonstrate, while European leaders have criticised the detention as democratic backsliding.",
      "Yerlikaya and the justice minister, Yilmaz Tunc, criticised the calls for action from CHP leader Ozgur Ozel as \u201cirresponsible\u201d amid a four-day ban on public gatherings.",
      "\u201cGathering and marching in protest are fundamental rights. But calling to the streets over an ongoing legal investigation is illegal and unacceptable,\u201d Tunc said on X early on Friday.",
      "Tunc said the courtroom was the place to respond to any legal process and called for calm, adding that the \u201cindependent and unbiased judiciary\u201d was evaluating the case. He has warned against linking Erdogan to Imamoglu\u2019s arrest.",
      "Demonstrations took place Thursday in Ankara, Izmir and Istanbul, as well as other provinces across the country, with police erecting barricades on several main streets.",
      "\u2018Theatrics\u2019",
      "Erdogan dismissed the opposition\u2019s criticism as \u201ctheatrics\u201d and \u201cslogans\u201d that distract from its internal mistakes.",
      "Speaking at the main Istanbul rally late Thursday, the CHP\u2019s Ozel responded: \u201cHey Erdogan, you\u2019re most scared of the streets. We are now on the streets, in squares. Continue to be afraid.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile you keep the one we elected in custody, we will not sit at home,\u201d he said before thousands of supporters.",
      "\u201cMr. Tayyip, you are scared and you are asking, \u2018are you calling people to the streets? Are you calling people to the squares?\u2019 Yes. I didn\u2019t fill up these squares or these streets, you did.\u201d",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s detention, many supporters had called for more concrete and organised action from the CHP, making Ozel\u2019s call a significant escalation of pressure on the government.",
      "The move against Imamoglu, 54, a two-term mayor, comes as the CHP was set to announce him as its presidential candidate on Sunday. It has called for non-party members to vote for him in ballot boxes set up across the country, as a sign of public resistance.",
      "No presidential election is scheduled until 2028 but Erdogan, 71, could call it early to avoid hitting a two-term limit if he decides to run again.",
      "Crackdown",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s detention caps a months-long legal crackdown on opposition figures that has been criticised as an attempt to hurt their electoral prospects and silence dissent, charges the government denies.",
      "Ankara has dramatically curbed civil disobedience since the 2013 nationwide Gezi Park protests against Erdogan\u2019s government prompted a violent state crackdown.",
      "In an interview Thursday, Ozel told Reuters his party would resist but not disrupt public order.",
      "He vowed to resist any potential attempts by authorities to remove him and CHP officials from the municipality headquarters, where they have been staying since Imamoglu\u2019s detention. The party would resist any unjust replacement of Imamoglu, he said.",
      "A government appointee could replace the mayor if he is formally arrested in coming days as part of the probe charging him with aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), deemed a terrorist organisation by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "His detention came a day after a university annulled his degree, which if upheld would block him from running for president under constitutional rules that require candidates to have a four-year degree."

    "story": [
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano in south-central Indonesia erupted three times into Friday, sending an ash column 8,000 meters (26,200 feet) high and prompting authorities to expand the danger zone around the volcano.",
      "The volcano on the remote island of Flores in East Nusa Tenggara province has had hundreds of earthquakes and visible volcanic activity has significantly increased in the last seven days.",
      "An eruption followed by an explosion was heard Thursday evening as far away as Larantuka and Maumere, two cities about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to 85 kilometers (53 miles) from the volcano. The eruption was recorded at several monitoring stations on Flores island, Muhammad Wafid, chief of Indonesia\u2019s Geology Agency, said in a statement.",
      "There were two other eruptions, and smaller activity occurred during the day Friday. Smoke blew around the crater with weak to moderate pressure, and firelight was seen at the peak, indicating the glowing volcanic material was at a shallow depth.",
      "Authorities raised the eruption alert to the highest level and expanded the danger zone from 7 kilometers (4.5 miles) to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater. No new evacuations were ordered.",
      "Several airlines canceled flights between Australia and Indonesia\u2019s tourist island of Bali, while other international and domestic flights to the island have been delayed.",
      "Residents were warned to be vigilant about heavy rainfall triggering lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano, Indonesia\u2019s geology agency said in a statement.",
      "An eruption of\u00a0Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki\u00a0in\u00a0November\u00a0killed nine people and injured dozens.",

      "Indonesia is an archipelago of 270 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanos and sits along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin."

    "story": [
      "CAIRO \u2014 Sudan\u2019s military said Friday that it had retaken the Republican Palace in Khartoum, the last heavily guarded bastion of rival paramilitary forces in the capital, after nearly two years of fighting.",
      "Social media videos showed its soldiers inside giving the date as the 21st day of Ramadan, the holy Muslim fasting month, which corresponds to Friday. A Sudanese military officer wearing a captain\u2019s epaulettes made the announcement in the video, and confirmed the troops were inside the compound.",
      "The palace appeared to be partly in ruins, with soldiers\u2019 steps crunching broken tiles underneath their boots. Soldiers carrying assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers chanted: \u201cGod is the greatest!\u201d",
      "Khaled al-Aiser, Sudan\u2019s information minister, said the military had retaken the palace in a post on the social platform X.",
      "\u201cToday the flag is raised, the palace is back and the journey continues until victory is complete,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The fall of the Republican Palace, a compound along the Nile River that was the seat of government before the war erupted and is immortalized on Sudanese banknotes and postage stamps, marks another battlefield gain for Sudan\u2019s military. It has made steady advances in recent months under army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan.",
      "It means the rival Rapid Support Forces, under Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have been mostly expelled from the capital of Khartoum after Sudan\u2019s war began in April 2023. Sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the capital Friday, though it was not clear if it involved fighting or was celebratory.",
      "The group did not immediately acknowledge the loss, which most likely won\u2019t stop the fighting as the RSF and its allies still hold territory elsewhere in Sudan.",
      "Late Thursday, the RSF claimed it seized control of the Sudanese city of al-Maliha, a strategic desert city in North Darfur near the borders of Chad and Libya. Sudan\u2019s military has acknowledged fighting around al-Maliha, but has not said it lost the city.",
      "Al-Maliha is about 125 miles north of the city of El Fasher, which remains held by the Sudanese military despite near-daily strikes by the surrounding RSF.",
      "The head of the U.N. children\u2019s agency has said the conflict created the world\u2019s largest and most devastating humanitarian crisis.",
      "The war has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll.",
      "The Republican Palace had been the seat of power during the British colonization of Sudan. It also saw some of the first independent Sudanese flags raised over the country in 1956 and had been the main office of Sudan\u2019s president and other top officials.",
      "The Sudanese military have long targeted the palace and its grounds, shelling and firing on the compound.",
      "Sudan, a nation in northeastern Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Dagalo led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military then began fighting each other in 2023.",
      "Burhan\u2019s forces, including Sudan\u2019s military and allied militias, have advanced against the RSF since the start of this year. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum. They then pushed in on RSF positions around the capital itself. The fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. accuse the RSF and allied Arab militias of again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "Since the war began, both the Sudanese military and the RSF have faced allegations of human rights abuses. Before President Joe Biden left office, the State Department declared the RSF are committing genocide.",
      "The military and the RSF have denied committing abuses."

    "story": [
      "NEW YORK \u2014 A real estate businessman who aided a Chinese effort to pressure an expatriate to return home has been sentenced to over a year in a U.S. prison.",
      "U.S. prosecutors say Quanzhong An\u2019s activities were part of the Chinese government\u2019s \u201cOperation Fox Hunt,\u201d which Beijing says is about pursuing people who have fled justice. Washington sees it as transnational repression, a term for governments working to silence dissenters beyond their borders.",
      "\u201cQuanzhong An acted at the direction of the (Chinese) government to harass and intimidate individuals living on U.S. soil as part of a pernicious scheme to force their repatriation,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Messages seeking comment were sent Thursday to China\u2019s embassy in Washington and consulate in New York. China has previously denied threatening its nationals abroad.",
      "An, a 58-year-old Chinese citizen and legal U.S. resident, pleaded guilty last year to acting as an illegal foreign agent. He was sentenced to 20 months behind bars. He has served seven of them already.",
      "\u201cMr. An is in my opinion, on balance, a very fine man and accordingly, seeing him return to prison for even one additional day is heartbreaking,\u201d his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Thursday. But he noted that prosecutors had sought a considerably longer prison term.",
      "According to prosecutors and an indictment, An was the key U.S.-based player in a transcontinental effort targeting a former manager of a Chinese state-owned company. Prosecutors have not named the man or the company.",
      "Beijing has accused the man of embezzlement, identified him as an \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d priority and asked law enforcement agencies worldwide to find and apprehend him, according to the indictment.",
      "An, who lives in suburban Roslyn Heights, New York, showed up at the home of the target\u2019s son to try to find the father in 2017, the indictment said.",
      "Then, in a series of recorded meetings with the son starting in early 2020, An leaned on him to secure his father\u2019s return to China. An said that he was trying to help the Chinese government communicate with the two, and that he would look good to Chinese officials if he could arrange the father\u2019s return, according to the indictment.",
      "While acknowledging that a Chinese embezzlement case against the father and son was a legally frivolous pressure tactic, An told the son that Chinese officials were monitoring the family\u2019s relatives and would \u201ckeep pestering you\u201d if the father did not return, the indictment said.",
      "\u201cTheir intent is to make your life difficult,\u201d the indictment quotes him as saying.",
      "An even offered to pay back the man\u2019s allegedly ill-gotten gains, according to the indictment, and eventually arranged for a Chinese official to press the man\u2019s son by phone.",
      "In recent years, the U.S. Justice Department has charged dozens of suspects with acts of transnational repression on behalf of China, Iran or other countries. On Thursday, a Manhattan federal jury convicted two men of conspiring to kill Iranian American journalist Masih Alinejad in what U.S. prosecutors claimed was a murder-for-hire plot financed by the Iranian government and foiled when police stopped the intended hit man\u2019s car. Tehran has denied involvement in any schemes to kill people in the U.S.",
      "An was charged in 2020 along with six other people, including his daughter Guangyang An. She is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty last May. The current status of the other five was not immediately clear.",
      "In a separate case in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse, three men were convicted in 2023 at the first trial surrounding U.S. claims about \u201cOperation Fox Hunt.\u201d Two of those defendants have been sentenced to prison; the third is awaiting sentencing."
